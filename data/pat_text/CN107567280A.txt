 For strawberry fruit in bottom (FOB) product, the strawberry product of 2 ounces (25%) is according to dosage put into cup,
Then the whiteness of 4 ounces (75%). 
 By housebroken group, (55 are stored at 4 DEG C after preparation in D28 (being stored 28 days at 4 DEG C after preparation) and D55
My god) when, the contrast of overall balance (overall balance) is carried out to the product obtained using culture 1 and culture 2.
Most substantially with most important variance reports in table 3 below in attribute. 
 Overall balance attribute：Evaluate the protrusion (spike) of the satisfactory degree (roundness) of flavor, any taste or flavor
Missing, and the missing of overwhelming feature (note) 
 
 Table 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 These results indicate that the product obtained using culture 2 has improved overall balance, and in the extension of 55 days
Storage period after, the difference even more high of whiteness part. 
 
 
   Embodiment 4 - acidifying (post-acidification) afterwards 
 Measured by pH, D0 (after preparation) and D7 (being stored 7 days at 4 DEG C after preparation) to whiteness it is rear be acidified into
Row evaluation.As a result it is reported in down Table 4 In. 
 
 Table 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 Using the simple products of culture 1 
 Using the simple products of culture 2 
 
 
 PH during D0 
 4.50 
 4.45 
 
 
 PH during D7 
 4.45 
 4.40 
 
 
 PH from D0 to D7 declines 
 - 1.1% 
 - 1.1% 
 
 
 
 
 
 This shows in terms of the rear acidifying of the clear fermented dairy product of demulsification, culture 1 (pH declines 1.1%) and (pH of culture 2
1.1%) decline is similar.It is surprisingly however it was, in terms of the lactose stabilized in the clear accessory substance of corresponding yogurt,
Culture 1 (lactose loss 22%) and culture 2 (lactose loss is 6.5%) be it is very different, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2.This
Show that lactose metabolism ability and the rear souring ability in the clear fermented dairy product of demulsification of yogurt culture middle clearly be not direct
Relation.
