The present invention relates to a novel Schizochytrium sp. strain easy to extract oil in a cell and a method for producing oil containing omega3 using thereof. [BACKGROUND ART] Thraustochytrids survive and distribute in various environments in nature.  They live in symbiosis by attaching to organisms, floats in marine environments or freshwater, or brackish environments, and are distributed in various sedimentary layers to survive.  These Thraustochytrids belong to the lowest layer of the marine ecological food chain, and is also classified as organic heterotrophic protist microalgae as phytoplankton. Thraustochytrid in the natural environment is functionally responsible for circulation and purification of natural circulating elements such as sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and the like. In addition, they contain polyunsaturated CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07  
 2 fatty acid (PUFA) including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) classified as omega-3 at a high concentration, to function as a source to the marine ecosystem. Most higher organisms including humans cannot synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acid including docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid by themselves, so they must be consumed as essential nutrients. Docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid among polyunsaturated fatty acid are essential fatty acids for brain, eye tissue and nervous system, and in particular, they are known to play an important role in development of the nervous system such as eyesight and motor nerve ability in infants and prevention of cardiovascular disease, and they are the most abundant components in the structural lipid of brain. Until now, the main source of polyunsaturated fatty acid is fish oil extracted from oil of blue fish such as mackerel, saury, tuna, horse mackerel, sardine, herring and the like, and this is very useful as a fish culture feed such as initial feed for seawater fish.  Although extraction and intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid from fish oil has been industrially developed, there are also disadvantages. The quality of fish oil varies depending on the species of fish, season and fishing location, and it is generated through fishing, so it is difficult to continuously supply it. In addition, there are limitations in the producing process and production due to the problem of contamination by heavy metals and organic chemicals comprised in fish oil, problem of oxidation of double bonds during the processing process as well as peculiar fishy smell of fish oil, and the like. In order to solve these problems, recently, research on a method for production of polyunsaturated fatty acid including docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid by microbial culture is being conducted. In particular, microalgae may provide several advantages over fish oil in addition to the ability to newly synthesize fatty acid naturally. It can be stably supplied through culturing on an industrial scale, and it enables production of biomass having a relatively constant CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07  
 3 biochemical composition. Unlike fish oil, lipid produced by microalgae do not have any unpleasant odor. Furthermore, it has a simpler fatty acid composition compared to fish oil, which facilitates the steps to isolate major fatty acid. Based on these advantages, recently, research and industrialization on production of polyunsaturated fatty acid comprising omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid (wunsaturated fatty acid) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (ARA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and a-linolenic acid, and the like, are progressing very rapidly, and they are mainly production of polyunsaturated fatty acid by Thraustochytrium sp. and Schizochytrium sp. microorganisms which are a kind of marine microalgae. For example, a method for producing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid using Schizochytrium sp.  ATCC20888 and Schizochytrium sp. PTA10208 which are Schizochytrium sp. microorganisms (U.S.  Patent No.  5,130,242), and additionally, a method for producing docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid using Thraustochytrium sp. ATCC10212 (Thraustochytrium sp. PTA10212) which is a Thraustochytrid series Thraustochytrium sp. microorganism is disclosed.

Sampling was carried out centered on a specific area where organic sediments were developed and observed, and the collected CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 environmental samples were transported to the laboratory environment within 7 days, and an operation for removing other pollution sources such as bacterial microorganisms and fungi and protists except for Thraustochytrid series microalgae was progressed. Through continuous microscopic examination, Thraustochytrid series microalgal cells were isolated focusing on samples which showed characteristic morphology and formed an observable zoospore within the life cycle, or constituted the ectoplasmic network generated during the developmental stage (FIG.  1). As a separation and culturing medium usable in the isolated process, a modified YEP medium (Yeast extract 0.1 g/L, peptone 0.5 g/L, MgSO4.7H20 2 g/L, Sea salt 50 g/L, H3B03 5.0 mg/L, MnC12 3.0 mg/L, CuSO4 0.2 mg/L, NaMo4.2H20 0.05 mg/L, CoSat 0.05 mg/L, ZnSO4.7H20 0.7 mg/L, Agar 15 g/L) was utilized. Pure isolated colonies from which the pollution sources were removed through several times of isolation and subculturing processes could be obtained, and the isolated colonies were under a pollution source control and removal process again in a solid medium including an antibiotic cocktail mix solution (Streptomycin sulfate 0-50 mg/L, Ampicillin 0-30 mg/L, Penicillin G 0-30 mg/L, Kanamycin sulfate 0-30 mg/L), and thereby, pure separable colonies were obtained. Example 2. Culturing evaluation of isolated microalgae and superior strain selection Culturing evaluation for the pure isolated colonies in Example 1 was performed, and through this, a superior strain was selected. Specifically, the pure isolated colonies in Example 1 were cultured using a modified GGYEP medium (glucose 5 g/L, glycerol 5 g/L, yeast extract 0.1 g/L, peptone 0.5 g/L, MgSO4.7H20 2 g/L, sea salt 50 g/L, H3B03 5.0 mg/L, MnC12 3.0 mg/L, CuSO4 0.2 mg/L, NaMo4.2H20 0.05 mg/L, CoSat 0.05 mg/L, ZnSO4.7H20 0.7 mg/L) in a 250 mL flask under the CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 condition of 10-35 C, 100-200 rpm for about 2 days. Based on the progressed culturing result, 29 kinds of microalgae that could grow at a temperature of 30 C or higher, and had an excellent growth rate and could secure a microbial cell amount were selected. For the selected microalgal strains, 500 ml flask scale culturing of the modified GYEP medium including glucose of 30 g/L  as a carbon source and culturing condition of 30 C, 150rpm was performed for 2 days. After confirming that all of the input carbon sources were consumed in the culturing environment for 2 days, the entire culturing solution was recovered and dried overnight in a dry oven at 60 C to obtain biomass. In order to analyze the lipid and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents of the cultured microalgal microbial cells, the method as below was used, and the microalgae-derived fatty acid-containing oil utilizing the dried microbial cells was measured by the following method. A process of adding 8.3 M hydrochloric acid solution (HC1) to 5 g of the dried microbial cells, and then hydrolyzing the cell walls of the microalgal microbial cells at 80 C, and then adding ethyl ether 30 mL and petroleum ether 20 mL and mixing for 30 seconds, and then centrifuging was repeated 3 times or more. The separated solvent layer was recovered, and transferred to a pre-weighed round flask, and then the solvent was removed through nitrogen purging, and the constant weight was cooled in a desicator. By measuring the weight of the dried oil by subtracting the weight of the empty flask from the weight of the flask after drying, the total oil content was calculated. The content of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) comprised in the oil was shown by pre-treating with methanolic 0.5N NaOH and 14% trifluoroborane methanol (BF3) and measuring by gas chromatography.

As a result, as shown in Table 1 and FIG. 2, the intracellular DNA content was shown very high in the 2 kinds of strains of CD01-1821 and CD01-1822. As the result of the fatty acid analysis, culturing evaluation was performed in a 5L scale culture medium for the 2 kinds of strains of CD01-1821, CD01-1822 with the excellent intracellular DNA content. For seed culture, they were cultured using a sterilized MJVV02 medium (glucose 30 g/L, MgSO4.7H20 3.0 g/L, Na2SO4 15 g/L, NaCl 0.8 g/L, yeast extract 1.0 g/L, MSG.1H20 1.0 g/L, NaNO3 1.0 g/L, KH2PO4 0.8 g/L, K2HPO4 1.5 g/L, CaCl2 0.5 g/L, vitamin mixed solution 10 ml/L) in a 500 mL flask under the condition of 30 C, 150 rpm for about 24 hours. The seed cultured flask was aliquoted and inoculated in a 5L culture medium. A glucose carbon source of 28% compared to the total culturing solution was supplied and culturing was progressed for about 72 hours, and culturing was performed in a sterilized MJW02 medium under the culturing environment condition of 30 C, 500 rpm, 1.5 vvm, pH 5-8.

Accordingly, the CD01-1821 strain was selected and used for strain sequence identification and additional strain development.  The type of the selected CD01-1821 strain was observed using an optical microscope and shown in FIG. 3. Example 3. Confirmation of culturing characteristics of CD01-1821 strain under complex carbon source condition In heterotrophic microorganism-based fermentation, a glucose component is mainly used as a raw material for a carbon source. At this time, glucose is a monosaccharide in a refined form of 90% or more, and the cost is generated higher during industrial scale fermentation compared to other carbon source raw material components. In order to utilize an inexpensive carbon source raw material and obtain price competitiveness through this, it is important to discover a strain that can be used for fermentation by a microorganism and can be cultured normally from the inexpensive carbon source component, other than purified glucose. Therefore, fermentation culturing evaluation was performed in raw sugar having glucose, fructose or sucrose as a main component for the CD01-1821 strain selected in Example 2 and CJM01 (KR 10-2100650 B1) strain to confirm culturing characteristics. The culturing was performed in a 30L culture medium, and based on the modified MJVV02 medium, experiments were conducted with raw sugar lysates comprising glucose 450 g/L, a mixture of glucose 225 g/L CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 and fructose 225 g/L, glucose 225 g/L, fructose 220 g/L and sulfate 1.51 g/L, respectively. The culturing condition was set same as the condition of 30 C, 500 rpm, 1.5 vvm, pH 5-8, and a carbon source of 35% of the total culturing solution was supplied, respectively.

On the other hand, the CJM01 strain showed a diauxic growth form of dualized carbon source consumption and cell growth pattern as a sugar component other than the glucose component is added in the medium and showed a phenomenon that the total culturing time was prolonged. Through the corresponding experiment result, it could be confirmed that the CD01-1821 strain had scale-up fermentation possibility under the complex carbon source condition. Example 4. Identification of novel Schizochytrium sp. strain CD01-1821 For biomolecular identification of the separated and selected microalgal strain CD01-1821 in Example 1 and Example 2, the 18S rRNA gene sequence was analyzed. CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 Specifically, after extracting and separating gDNA from the colony of the pure separated microalgae CD01-1821, PCR amplification reaction was performed using primers 18s-Fwd, LABY-ARev for gene amplification of the 18s rRNA region described in Table 4. [Table 4] SEQ ID NO:        Primer        Sequence (5' - 3') 1          185-Fwd       AAC CTG GTT GAT CCT GCC AGT 2          LABY-ARev GGG ATC GAA GAT Are TAG  For PCR reaction, using a reaction solution containing taq polymerase, denaturation at 95 C  for 5 minutes was performed, and then denaturation at 95 C for 30 seconds, annealing at 50 C for 30 seconds, and polymerization at 72 C for 2 minutes were repeated 35 times, and then polymerization reaction was performed at 72 C for 5 minutes. The reaction solution amplified through the PCR process was under electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, and thereby, it was confirmed that DNA fragments of about 1000 bp size were amplified, and nucleotide sequence sequencing analysis was progressed. As the result of analysis, it was confirmed that the obtained corresponding sequence showed homology of 95.11% to the 18S rRNA gene sequence of Schizochytrium limacinum strain OUC109 belonging to Thraustochyftid family (f3t) series microalgae, and showed homology of 95.0% to the 18S rRNA gene sequence of Schizochytrium sp. strain LY-2012 of Schizochytrium sp., through NCBI BLAST search. Through this, it was confirmed that the isolated microalgae CD01-1821 was a novel Schizochytrium sp. strain, and named Schizochytrium sp. CD01-1821 strain, and deposited at Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) on August 23, 2021 and was given an accession number KCTC14660BP.

Measurement of death rate according to gamma ray irradiation In order to develop an artificial mutant strain from the wild-type microalgal strain separated in Example 4 (Schizochytrium sp. CD01-1821), the death rate according to the gamma ray dose and the gamma ray irradiation condition was selected. Specifically, the novel microalgae CD01-1821 was cultured in a modified GGYEP  medium comprising glucose and glycerol of 5 g/L, respectively, for about 10 hours. The present period is determined to be the Early Exponential phase, in which zoospores observed in the unique life cycle of the Thraustochytrid series microalgae mainly occur and are distributed, and for more efficient genetic mutation, the cell culturing solution of the corresponding period was obtained and used. The culturing solution sample was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 20 minutes) and only the microbial cells in which the culture medium was removed were obtained, and they were suspended in 0.1M Phosphate Buffer Solution comprising NaCl 1.5% so as to be 109cells/mL. The microalgal microbial cell sample suspended in NaCl 1.5%-0.1M phosphate buffer solution was used for an experiment for development of a gamma ray-derived artificial mutant strain.  The gamma ray irradiation experiment was performed in Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Advanced Radiation Technology Institute, and it was progressed by irradiating a gamma ray dose of 5-8 kGY. Suspension samples irradiated with the gamma ray undergo a recovery process overnight, and then they were inoculated and smeared in a GYEP medium comprising agar 20g/L and cultured at 30 C for about 5 days, and then the number of growing colonies was calculated and the death rate for each gamma ray dose was measured. [Calculation formula 21 CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 Death rate (%) = [{(number of colonies of untreated group) - (number of colonies of treated group)}/(number of colonies of untreated group)] X 100 [Table 5[ Number                   of Gamma ray                   Death dose (kGY)    growing       rate (%) colonies (EA) 6.0          ?190           -6.5          > 17           91.1 7.0          > 9            95.3 7.5          0              100 8.0          0              100 Radiation untreated    > 90           0 group As a result, as shown in Table 2, an appropriate dose in which the CFU value of the number of growing colonies and the number of viable cells according to the gamma ray irradiation dose was reduced by 95% or more was confirmed. Specifically, the result that 91.1%, 95.3%, 100%, 100% were dead, respectively, at the gamma ray irradiation dose of 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 kGY was shown. Under the gamma ray dose condition of 7.5 GY or more, all of them were dead and microalgal colonies could not be obtained, and the gamma ray dose condition of 7.0 kGY showing the death rate of 95.3% was selected. Example 5-2. Separation of mutant microalgal strain After irradiating a gamma ray of a 7.0 kGY dose into the novel microalgal strain CD01-1821 by the same method described in Example 5-1, the microalgal culturing solution sample was cultured in a GYEP medium comprising agar 20 g/L and cycloate inhibiting fatty acid synthesis.  By selecting the microalgal colony growing during culturing for about 4 weeks, subculturing was CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 performed under the same medium and culturing environmental condition. A  strain capable of continuous growth between passages and excellent in colony growth was preferably selected. In addition, a colony morphologically white and slippery was selected. Example 5-3. Selection of excellent mutant microalgal strain Through culturing in a flask scale for the mutant strains selected in Example  
 5-2, the sugar consumption rate was analyzed, and through crude fat and fatty acid analysis, an excellent mutant strain was selected. Specifically, in order to culture the novel wild-type microalgae CD01-1821 confirmed in Example 4 and the mutant microalgae selected in Example 5-2 in a flask scale, by culturing in a GYEP medium comprising glucose 30g/L in a final volume (working volume) of 50mL in a 500mL flask, under the condition of 30 C, 180rpm for 20 hours, a certain amount of microbial cells which could be analyzed were obtained. The amount of glucose remaining and the absorbance (optical density) at 680nm were analyzed through sampling between cultures, and the sugar consumption rate was measured through this. As a result, as shown in FIG. 4, 4 kinds of strains with excellent sugar consumption rate and growth among the evaluated mutant strains were selected. Revaluation of the selected 4 kinds of strains were conducted in a fermenter with a capacity of 5L. Culturing in a GYEP medium comprising 30 g/L was used as a seed culture, and it was aliquoted into a 5L fermenter containing a sterilized MJVV02 medium and culturing was progressed under the condition of 30 C, 500 rpm, 1.5 vvm, pH 5-8. The consumption rate of glucose, a major carbon source during culturing for 15 hours and absorbance (optical density) and dry cell weight (g/L) confirmed as a growth index were measured and evaluated, and thereby, the CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 strain CD01-2147 with most excellent growth was finally selected. The Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 was deposited to a depository authority, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) on August 23, 2021, and was given an accession number KCTC14661BP.

They were cultured in a 500 mL  flask under the condition of 30 C, 150 rpm for about 20 hours using a sterilized MJVV02 medium on a purpose of seed culture. The seed cultured flask was aliquoted and inoculated in a 5L  fermenter and culturing was performed under the condition of 30 C, 500 rpm, 1.5 vvm, pH 5-8 in the sterilized MJW02 medium and culturing environment. After completing the culturing, the microbial cell in which the supernatant was removed was used for an experiment for measurement of crude fat and fatty acid, and crude protein contents, and extraction and recovery of intracellular oil.

In addition, it was confirmed that the crude fat amount and fatty acid content in crude fat of the CD01-2147 strain was higher than the CD01-1821 strain.

Analysis of crude protein content of CD01-1821 and CD01-2147 strain culturing solution samples In order to analyze the crude protein content in the Schizochytrium sp. CD01-1821 and Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 strain culturing solution samples, the method as below was used. Specifically, dried microbial cells, each fermented solution dried product (specimen) corresponding to about 20-30 mg was precisely measured and placed in a decomposition tube, and two decomposition accelerators were added. The decomposition accelerator is effectively decomposed when the ratio of sulfuric acid (H2504) and potassium sulfate (K2504) is 1.4-2.0:1Ø  Then, concentrated sulfuric acid (H2504) 12-15 mL was added to the decomposition tube, and it was cooled to a room temperature when the color of the decomposed solution was transparent light green (using a copper accelerator) or transparent yellow (using a selenium catalyst) by decomposing in a decomposition device at 420 C for 45 to 60 minutes. After cooling, 80mL of distilled water was added to the decomposed test solution. After adding 25 mL  of collection solution mixed with the mixing indicator into an Erlenmeyer flask, this was placed on a distillation apparatus, and the Erlenmeyer flask stand was lifted so that the distilled solution entered the collection solution during distillation. 50 mL of sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) (amount corresponding to 4 times of sulfuric acid used during decomposition) was added to a decomposition tube, and it was distilled in a distillation apparatus for 3 to 4 minutes. It was confirmed that the collection solution in the Erlenmeyer flask of the distillation apparatus turned green while collecting ammonia (NH3) contained in the distilled solution. The distilled solution was titrated using a hydrochloric acid solution (generally, 0.1N or 0.2N) until the end point reached a pale pink color, and the amount of acid used for titration was recorded. In case of an automatic CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 device, distillation, titration and calculation are all performed automatically. Using the experimental result, nitrogen % was derived by Calculation formula 2 below.

In addition, in the amino acid content in the dried microbial cell, glutamic acid was highest, and it was high in the order of phenylalanine, lysine, alanine, valine, arginine, methionine, aspartic acid, glycine, leucine, isoleucine, and serine.  Through this, it was confirmed that the amino acid in the CD01-2147 dried microbial cell was composed of glutamic acid, phenylalanine, lysine, alanine, valine, arginine, methionine, aspartic acid, glycine, leucine, isoleucine and serine. Example 6-4. Analysis of oil recovery amount of CD01-1821 strain and CD01-2147 CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 strain fermented solution In order to compare the oil recovery amount of the culturing solution samples of the Schizochytrium sp. CD01-1821 strain and Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 strain, the following experiment was performed. Specifically, for the microalgal fermented solution in which culturing was completed, an oil extraction experiment was progressed. After heating the culturing solution to 60 C, pH was adjusted to 7 using NaOH 50% solution. Compared to the weight of the fermented solution, Alcalase (Alcalase 2.4FG, Novozymes) of 0.2%(w/w) was added and reacted with stirring at 60 C  for 3 hours. The enzyme-reacted fermented solution was centrifuged at 3800g, and the recovery rate from oil of the supernatant was compared. In the present description, the oil recovery rate means an amount of oil contained in a cell, that is, an amount of extractable oil when extracting oil through an experiment, in the crude fat content. [Table 8[ DCW                  Crude    fat Crude protein Oil recovery content                          content      rate (g/L)                (%, /Biomass) (%, /Biomass) (%, /crude fat amount) As a result, as shown in Table 8, it was confirmed that the recovery rate of the fermented solution of the CD01-2147 strain having a low crude protein content was twice or higher than that of the fermented solution of the CD01-1821 strain having a high crude protein content.

Culturing of SR21 strain and CD01-2147 strain In order to evaluate the productivity when a carbon source was added in a fermenter of the Schizochytrium sp. SR21 strain and developed strain CD01-2147 strain, a glucose carbon source of 41% compared to the total culturing solution was supplied and culturing was progressed for 60 hours in a 5L fermenter. For the purpose of seed culture, culturing was performed using a sterilized MJVV02 medium in a 500mL flask under the condition of 30  C and 150 rpm for about 20 hours. The seed cultured flask was dispensed and inoculated with a 5L  fermenter and cultured in a sterilized MJVV02 medium under the culturing environment condition of 28 C, 400 rpm, 1.0vvm, pH 5-9. After completing the culturing, the microbial cells from which the supernatant was removed were used for measuring the crude protein, crude fat and fatty acid contents. In addition, they were used in an experiment for intracellular oil extraction and recovery. Example 7-2. Analysis of oil recovery amount of SR21 strain and CD01-2147 strain fermented solutions In order to compare the oil recovery amount of the Schizochytrium sp. SR21 strain and Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 strain culturing solution samples, the following experiment was performed. Specifically, an oil extraction experiment was progressed for the microalgal fermented solution after completing culturing. The culturing solution was heated to 60 C, and then pH was adjusted to 7 using NaOH 50% solution. Against the cell concentration in the fermented solution, Alcalase (Alcalase 2.4FG, Novozymes) was added in 15%(w/w) and reacted with stirring at 60 C  for 3.5 hours. The enzyme-reacted fermented solution was centrifuged at 3800g to recover the oil CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 of the supernatant. It was confirmed that the recovered supernatant was a layer in which oil and emulsified material were mixed. The corresponding supernatant was stirred at 75 C and heat-treated for 30 minutes, and then centrifuged at 3800g to recover the oil of the supernatant. [Table 9[ Crude protein Oil                                        recovery DCW                     Crude fat content content                                            rate (g/L)                   (%, /Biomass)    (%, /Biomass) (%, /crude fat amount) As a result, as shown in Table 9, it was confirmed that the recovery rate of the fermented solution of the CD01-2147 strain was twice or higher than that of the fermented solution of the SR21 strain.
