 After SD rat (body weight 380 ~ 400g, Japanese SLC Inc.) is anaesthetized, after broken end, blood-letting are butchered, according to anatomical standard extraction lower distal colon (distal colon), under stereoscopic microscope, circular muscle and longitudinal muscle layer are peeled off, make the mucosa-submucosal nervous plexus specimen comprising submucosal nervous plexus.Specimen is arranged on and measures area 0.64cm
         2 ussing chamber (CHM2, WPI, FL, USA), the potential difference that produces and short circuit current short-circuit current (I between the mucosa side-serosa side measuring specimen
         sC ).To being organized in the command pulse that 1 minute applies 3 seconds 10mV, obtain membrane conductance coefficient (Gt) by the variable quantity of short circuit current.At baseline (basel) I
         sC stable with Gt is carry out electricity irritation (25V continues 0.5ms (duration of 0.5ms), 5Hz, 120s) for nerve under mucosa, confirm the state of tissue.Afterwards, give the test thalline of lactobacillus or the dilute solution (500 μ g/ml) of fermentation milk to mucosa side, measure I
         sC with the change of Gt, evaluation test material is for being induced the Cl produced by nerve stimulation
         - / HCO
         3   - the impact of secretion.
       
 The result display evaluated is carried out in impact for the sterilization fermentation milk of various lactobacillus, the sterilization fermentation milk of CP2305 strain is compared with known preservation strain A (L.gasseri) and other 5 bacterial strains (B ~ F), suppress ion secretion more strongly, control moisture is secreted, and contributes to diarrhoea and suppresses (Fig. 7). 
 [embodiment 9] 
 And then, in order to carry out the impact of only having thalline to bring the ion transportation that the nerve stimulation of rat large intestine (lower distal colon) is induced, modulate the sterilization body of various lactobacillus, carry out the result given, CP2305 strain sterilization body is compared with bacillus acidophilus (L.acidophilus) sterilization body with known preservation strain A (Lactobacillus gasseri (L.gasseri)) sterilization body, suppress ion secretion significantly, contribute to diarrhoea strongly and suppress (Fig. 8). 
 And then in addition, in order to investigate the impact that brings of the ion transportation giving to induce for the nerve stimulation of rat large intestine (lower distal colon) of the viable bacteria body of CP2305 strain, viable bacteria fermentation breast, sterilization body, sterilization fermentation milk, result shows in its all form, and particularly CP2305 strain sterilization body contributes to diarrhoea strongly and suppresses (Fig. 9).
