 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to the novelty teabag of bacillus bifidus (special but non-exclusive be probiotic bacillus bifidus), and relate to food, feed product, dietary supplement and the pharmaceutical formulation containing bacillus bifidus. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Diabetes (" Diabetes mellitus ", or be usually called for short " diabetes ") be a kind of disease being characterized as metabolism disorder and the abnormal hyperglycemia (blood glucose is too high) caused due to insulinotropic hormones level and/or effect deficiency.The characteristic symptom of this disease be the urine caused due to elevated blood glucose levels generate too much (polyuria), attempt to compensate the excessive thirst of urinating and increasing and fluid take in increase (polydipsia), due to hyperglycemia for the impact of optometry the blurred vision caused, unaccountable weight loss and drowsiness.If blood glucose only slightly raises, these symptoms may be not too obvious. 
 World Health Organization (WHO) is thought the diabetes of three kinds of principal modes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes (occurring in During Pregnancy), they have the different causes of disease and Crowds Distribute.Although form of ownership finally all can not produce owing to pancreatic beta cell the insulin being enough to prevent blood glucose too high, and its cause of disease is not identical.Type 1 diabetes is damaged owing to pancreatic beta cell autoimmune usually.The feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus is the insulin resistance in target tissue.This causes the insulin needing abnormal a large amount, and then diabetes occurs when Î² cell can not meet these needs.Gestational diabetes is owing to relating to insulin resistance and similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the hormone of gestation can cause the women with the genetic factor that this disease occurs to produce insulin resistance. 
 Gestational diabetes disappears along with child's childbirth usually, but 1 type and type 2 diabetes mellitus are chronic diseases.All types of diabetes all can be treated owing to can medically use at 1921 insulins.Type 1 diabetes (pancreas is excreting insulin not) directly can be treated by means of only insulin injection, but diet and the adjustment of other life style are also parts for treatment.Type 2 diabetes mellitus can use Diet Therapy, tablet and injection and insulin afterwards to supplement combined therapy. 
 Diabetes can cause many complication.If this disease can not appropriately be controlled, then can there is acute complications (hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis or Non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma).Serious long-term complications comprises cardiovascular disease (dual danger), chronic renal failure, retina injury (can cause blind), (a few types) nerve injury, and microvascular lesions (can cause sexual impotence and poor healing).The poor healing of wound, particularly sufficient wound can cause gangrene, may need amputation.The risk can improving most of aforementioned complication is improved to the appropriate treatment of diabetes and to the attention of controlling of blood pressure and Lifestyle factors (such as not smoking and body weight of keeping fit).In developed country, diabetes are the blind most important reasons of the adult of non-senile, and be also the main cause in the non-traumatic amputation of adult, in the U.S., diabetic nephropathy is the principal disease needing Rend dialysis. 
 At present, diabetes are chronic diseases, can not cure, and its medical science emphasis must focus on and process/avoid the relevant problem of possible short-term and long-term diabetes.The training of patient, diet support, sensation is taken exercise, self-glucose monitoring has particular importance effect, target keeps parameters of short term glycemic level and long-term blood glucose level within the acceptable range.Need careful control, to reduce the danger of long-term complications.This is in theory by combination diet, exercise and reduce body weight (2 type), use various oral diabetes medicine (only 2 types) and insulin (1 type and cumulative for unresponsive 2 types of oral medication) and can realize.In addition, in view of the high risk of associated cardiovascular disease, should pass through more exercises, stop smoking, absorb suitable diet, wear diabetes socks and change lifestyles to control blood pressure and cholesterol, and any medicine taken if necessary in multiple medications reduces blood pressure. 
 Current listing or carry out the oral antidiabetic of clinical trial and insulin analog comprises biguanides (such as metformin), sulfonylurea (such as carbutamide, chlorpropamide, glibenclamide (Glyburide), gliclazide (gliclazide), glimepiride, glidiazinamide (glipizide), gliquidone, tolazamide or tolbutamide), alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (such as Acarbose (acarbose), miglitol (miglitol) or voglibose (voglibose)), thiazolidinediones (TZD) (such as pioglitazone, RIVOGLITAZONE or rosiglitazone), meglitinide (such as Nateglinide, repaglinide or Mitiglinide), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (such as A Luolieting, BMS-477118, Xi Talieting or vildagliptin), glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs (such as Exenatide, Arg34Lys26-(N-EPSILON-(N-ALPHA-Palmitoyl-L-GAMMA-glutamyl))-GLP-1[7-37] or albiglutide), dextrin analog (such as Pramlintide), Insulin Asp (such as insulin lispro, insulin aspart and paddy rely insulin), Recent Development of Long-acting Insulin Analogs (insulin Glargine, insulin detemir), dual PPAR agonist (such as aleglitazar) and SGLT2 inhibitor (such as dapagliflozin, remogliflozin and She Gelie clean (sergliflozin)). 
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus is usually relevant with obesity.Body Mass Index (BMI) (being calculated divided by height (rice) square by body weight (kilogram)) is the most generally accepted overweight and/or fat measurement method.BMI is considered to overweight more than 25.BMI 30 or higher is defined as obesity, and BMI is that 35 or higher to be considered to serious same characteristic of disease fat, and BMI 40 or higher is considered to morbid obesity.Fat mortality rate increases, and BMI is relevant to dual health risk more than 32.Body changes (insulin resistance), short inflammatory conditions and thrombotic tendency to the reaction of insulin and increases (short thrombosis state). 
 Central obesity (being characterised in that waist/buttocks is fatter than high upper part of the body type or waist protruding type) is the risk factor of the particular importance of diabetes and metabolism syndrome (multiple be seriously partial to the disease of cardiovascular disease and the gathering of risk factor).These are type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels (combined hyperlipidemia).

 In further embodiment, can be used for alleviating mammalian tissues inflammation for bacillus bifidus of the present invention (with lactobacillus (if present)), special but non-exclusive be liver organization inflammation, muscular tissue inflammation and/or fatty tissue inflammation. 
 In one embodiment, can be used for alleviating liver organization inflammation for bacillus bifidus of the present invention (with lactobacillus (if present)).This gives the potential that described antibacterial is used for the treatment of hepatitis, and the feature of described hepatitis is that a large amount of hepatocyte is damaged and there is inflammatory cell in hepatic tissue. 
 Hepatitis can be divided into two subclass according to the persistent period: acute hepatitis (continuing to be less than 6 months) and chronic hepatitis (continuing more than 6 months).Also can classify to hepatitis according to its cause of disease: such as, hepatitis can comprise venereal infection toxicity hepatitis (such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D and hepatitis E), the hepatitis (such as monocytosis and cytomegalovirus) caused by other viral diseases, the hepatitis caused by severe bacterial infections or amoeba infection, drug-induced hepatitis, the hepatitis that the toxin of such as ethanol causes, autoimmune hepatitis (wherein a large amount of hepatocyte is destroyed by patient's self immune system) and the hepatitis (such as Wei Ersenshi disease (metabolism disorder of body copper) and hemochromatosis (body Iron metabolism disorder)) caused by congenital metabolic disease. 
 In one embodiment, can be used for alleviating muscular tissue inflammation for bacillus bifidus of the present invention (with lactobacillus (if present)).This gives the potential that described antibacterial is used for the treatment of myositis (wherein meat fiber and skin are inflamed and damage, and cause muscular strength to weaken). 
 Myositis has a few types, and it has influence on the different piece of body.Particular form according to the treatable myositis of the present invention comprises: polymyositis (PM), the wherein muscle of body mass part, and the muscle particularly closest to those parts of trunk is inflamed; Dermatomyositis (DM), is wherein supplied the blood capillary of blood by infringement to muscle and skin and has influence on muscle fiber and skin simultaneously; Inclusion body myositis (IBM), is characterized by and comprise wrist or the whole body muscular strength that refers to weakens gradually, dysphagia occurs, and forearm and/or vastus atrophy; Juvenile myositis (JM), wherein relates to that child's muscular strength weakens, erythra and dysphagia. 
 Surprisingly, the present inventor finds that bacillus bifidus (with lactobacillus (if present)) involved in the present invention can alleviate mammalian fat tissue inflammation.According to the Epidemiological Evidence display in document, between the inflammation of people, obesity and insulin resistance, there is statistics relation (Cani etc., Diabetes, 2007,56,1761-1772 and the list of references quoted thereof).This discovery imparts that bacillus bifidus (with lactobacillus (if present)) can be used for treating that mammal is fat thus, the potential of diabetes and associated conditions, metabolic disease and cardiovascular outcome. 
 According to Berg and Scherer, Circulation Research, 2005,96,939, up-to-date evidence has highlighted the effect of fatty tissue in the systemic inflammation condition of causeing fat relevant angiopathy and cardiovascular risk.Circulation mediator of inflammation participates in the mechanism that blood vessel injury and atherosclerosis change, many all direct by adipose cell and the macrophages secrete being derived from fatty tissue in these inflammatory proteins.Several factors that the fat cardiovascular risk with improving is associated are identified.In this case, adipocyte-specific secretory protein adiponectin (adiponectin) is the promising material standed for of special tool, and its level in obesity reduces. 
 The new therapy apparatus meeting in cardiovascular disease field is represented to the targeted inhibition of the several proinflammatory cascades in adipose cell.Therefore, expect that the suppression of fatty tissue inflammation is that the treatment of cardiovascular disease provides treatment benefit. 
 The example of the cardiovascular disease that bacillus bifidus (with lactobacillus (if present)) can be used to treat according to the present invention comprises aneurysm, angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, cerebrovas-cularaccident (apoplexy), cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and Peripheral blood vessel disease. 
 Aneurysm is by blood vessel wall pathological changes or weakens blood vessel contrafluxion expansion (balloon sample is swollen convex) caused.Aneurysm is most commonly in tremulous pulse and the aorta (going out the major arteries of heart, so-called aortic aneurysm) of brain basilar part (cerebral arterial circle).Along with aneurysm increases, the risk of breaking increases, and this can cause serious hemorrhage or comprise other complication of sudden death. 
 Angina pectoris (angina pectoris, be commonly referred to angina) cause due to myocardial ischemia (leiphemia and oxygen supply thus lack), normally because coronary artery (blood vessel of heart) blocks or spasm and the serious chest pain that causes.Coronary heart disease (anginal Etiological) causes due to the atherosclerosis of heart arter. 
 Atherosclerosis is the disease that the arterial wall caused due to fatty material (such as cholesterol) accumulation thickens.It is that one has influence on arterial vascular syndrome, it is the chronic inflammatory reaction of arterial wall, to a great extent owing to macrophage leukocyte accumulation, and promoted by low-density (particularly granule) lipoprotein (carrying the plasma protein of cholesterol and triglyceride), and suitably do not remove metabolism of lipid and cholesterol by functional high density lipoprotein (HDL) from macrophage.Atherosclerosis is commonly called arteriosclerosis or " hair attachment (furring) ", usually causes because intra-arterial forms multiple speckle. 
 Apoplexy is that the brain function of the quick generation caused due to cerebral blood supply obstacle is lost.This ischemia that may cause due to thrombosis or thromboembolism (blood supply shortage) or cause due to hemorrhage.Therefore, affected brain district can not play a role, thus cause body side one or more limb activities can not, language understanding or descriptive power lack, or a side view field can not be seen and finally dead. 
 Cerebrovascular disease is one group of cerebral disturbance relevant to the angiopathy of supply brain.Hypertension is the most important reason of the Ink vessel transfusing side form endothelium of the collagen contacts of infringement and lower floor, and wherein platelet starts not always complete and perfect repair process in underlying collagenous accumulation.Persistence hypertension forever changes blood vessel structure, makes that it is narrow, stiff, distortion and uneven, makes comparatively to be subject to fluctuation of blood pressure impact.Blood pressure in sleep procedure reduces the blood flow narrowed in blood vessel can be caused significantly to reduce, and cause cerebral infarction in morning, blood pressure raises suddenly, can cause angiorrhexis, causes intracranial hemorrhage in process of excitation in the daytime.Mainly old age, diabetes, smoker or the crowd with ischemic heart desease suffer from cerebrovascular disease.The disease that all arteries malfunction is correlated with all can be categorized in the disease being called macrovascular diseases.This is undue simple research, makes fatty deposits or thrombus obstruction tremulous pulse by it.The result of cerebrovascular disease can comprise apoplexy, or even sometimes comprises hemorrhagic apoplexy.In cerebrovas-cularaccident process, ischemia or other vascular dysfunction can affect one. 
 Heart failure is the generic term of hypokinemia wherein for the physiological status of body requirement.This can occur when cardiac output is low (being often called " congestive heart failure ").The commonly encountered diseases of heart failure is because comprising myocardial infarction and other forms of ischemic heart desease, hypertension, valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathy. 
 Coronary heart disease (or coronary heart disease) refers to that coronary artery circulation can not Cardiomyocytes and the appropriate circulation of surrounding tissue supply.It is equal to atherosclerotic coronary heart disease usually, but coronary artery disease is attributable to other reasons, such as coronary artery spasm.Narrowly may to cause due to spasm. 
 When causing some cardiac cell death when arriving the blood supply of cardiac component and being blocked, there is myocardial infarction (being commonly referred to heart attack).Coronary occlusion (retardance) after this most normal atheromatous plaque owing to rapid wear (in arterial wall, the instability of lipid (as cholesterol) and leukocyte (particularly macrophage) is gathered) breaks.The ischemia (blood supply is limited) caused and hypoxgia, if the sufficiently long time does not process, then can cause myocardial damage and/or necrosis (infraction). 
 Peripheral blood vessel disease (PVD), also referred to as Peripheral arteral disease (PAD) or Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), comprises all diseases caused by the large artery trunks obturation in arm and lower limb.PVD is attributable to atherosclerosis, causes narrow inflammatory process, thromboembolism or thrombosis, and it causes acute or chronic ischemia (blood supply shortage), usually occurs in leg.

 materials and methods 
 
 Animal model and probiotic bacteria process 
 To feed chow diet (NC) (A03 to the C57Bl/6 male mice in a collection of 50 10 week ages, SAFE, Augy, or high fat diet (HFD) (comprising 72% fat (Semen Maydis oil and Adeps Sus domestica), 28% protein and < 1% carbohydrate) (SAFE France), Augy, France) continue 4 weeks.These meals be particularly conducive to generation obesity before induced diabetes (see, such as, Cani etc., 2008 " Role of gut microflora in the development of obesity and insulin resistance following high-fat diet feeding " .Pathol Biol (Paris); Cani etc., Diabetes 2008,57,1470-81; Knauf etc., Endocrinology 2008,149,4768-77; Cani etc., Diabetologia 2007,50,2374-83; Cani etc., Diabetes 2007,56,1761-1772 and Turini etc., Swiss Med Wkly 2007,137,700-4). 
 Abdominal cavity glucose tolerance test is carried out to mice.Area under calculated curve, and according to different tests group or often organize 10 mice (10 mice/groups) uniform distribution mices.Normal feedstuff (n=10) or high fat diet (HFD) (n=40) is used to feed mice 4 weeks again.Every day as described below processes HFD mice, continues 4 weeks: 1. mordanting; 2. bifidobacterium animalis sp. strain 420 (B420) (every mice 10
         9 individual antibacterial); 3. bacillus acidophilus NCFM (every mice 10
         9 individual antibacterial); 4.NCFM+B420 (every mice 5 Ã 10
         8 b420+5 Ã 10
         8 nCFM).Then as described belowly abdominal cavity test is carried out.Mice is housed in (the 12 hours of daylight circulations of putting upside down, black out during 10:00 in the morning) in controlled environment.
       
 Body weight is evaluated 
 From research meals are used (before probiotic bacteria is used 4 weeks), to probiotic bacteria process 6 weeks (until putting to death), weekly to mouse weights. 
 Organization 
 ECO-MRI is used monthly to measure mice organization.Measure total BFM, total lean body mass, total Water, free water content, subcutaneus adipose tissue weight, mesenteric adipose tissues weight and liver heavy. 
 Glucose-tolerant 
 After using research meals 4 weeks, (before probiotic supplemented) detects glucose-tolerant, to guarantee glucose intolerance and the diabetic disease states of HFD mice, and after administration of probiotics 4 weeks detection glucose-tolerants.In brief, 20% glucose (1g/kg) is injected to the intraperitoneal of 6 hours empty stomach mices.When glucose excites (glucose challenge) first 30 minutes, glucose when exciting and glucose excite after 30,60 and 90 minutes time, use glucose meter (ACCU-check Active, Roche, Meylan, France) detect blood glucose by 3.5 Î¼ L tail vein bloods. 
 Blood insulin 
 Detect the blood insulin concentration of fasted conditions and fed conditions. 
 Insulin sensitivity 
 When completing probiotic bacteria process, carrying out performing the operation in stock to mice, being wherein built-in with conduit for further venoclysis at stock.Start within first 4 days, to implant described stock angular vein conduit in test day (infusion).Test day, to mice 5 hours on an empty stomach.Under tritium-labeled glucose exists, carry out hyperinsulinism normal glucose euglycemic clamp 3 hours, to measure inversion rate of glucose.The cold glucose of infusion is normal to maintain blood glucose simultaneously. 
 Marker of inflammation (real-time quantitative PCR) 
 The inflammatory conditions of fat, liver and muscular tissue is detected by the concentration of quantitative RT PCR analysis measurement marker of inflammation TNF Î±, IL-1 Î², PAI-1, IL6mRNA.TriPure reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) is used to extract total mRNA from the fat pad transplanted and the subcutaneous fat of receptor, liver and muscular tissue.As described in Cani etc., Diabetes 2007,56,1761-1772, AbiPrism 7900 sequence detection system instrument and software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) is used to carry out PCR.RPL19 rRNA is used to carry out standardization as interior mark to the concentration of each mRNA, for the RNA loading of each sample. 
 Result 
 Glucose-tolerant 
 As shown in Figure 1, all dieting high fat meals mice group of 4 weeks all has glucose intolerance and diabetes.After B420 process, the feature of mice is that glucose-tolerant improves (Fig. 2).Only B420 obtains significant reduction, and the combination for independent NCFM or NCFM and B420 obtains healthy trend of being benefited.Therefore, reach a conclusion: B420 process starts to improve glucose-tolerant.The process of longer time may have larger impact to blood glucose spectrum. 
 Mice organization 
 The impact (Fig. 3) that data display uses the probiotic bacteria process of combination of B420 and B420 and NCFM to reduce HFD for 4 weeks to increase for BFM.Do not observe the impact (Fig. 4,5 and 6) of described process for lean body mass, free water weight and total water weight. 
 Especially, Fig. 3 shows B420 process and B420+NCFM and is combined in the effect (wherein, left post embodies result before treatment, and right post embodies the result after process) reduced in impact that high fat diet increases for BFM.In Fig. 3,
         * represent the result significantly different from the same non-process mice organized.Utilize the combination of B420 or B420 and NCFM to observe body weight to increase on a small quantity.But, because HFD result display HFD takes in the BFM that significantly should increase mice, this represent the remarkable improvement of untreated HFD mice.
       
 Because described process weighs do not show impact for lean body mass, the heavy and total water of free water, can from reaching a conclusion above, the weight differences obtained is only relevant to fatty tissue. 
 Each tissue weight 
 Data display B420 and B420+NCFM reduces mesenteric adipose tissues weight.Do not observe the difference (Fig. 7,8 and 9) of subcutaneus adipose tissue or liver weight. 
 Especially, Fig. 8 shows the impact on mesenteric adipose tissues weight in the mice using the high fat diet of probiotic bacteria process to feed.Independent B420 or its obtain remarkable result (when comparing with untreated HFD group, obtaining the P value of < 0.05) with the combination of NCFM.The feature of the mice of B420 and B420+NCFM process is that mesenteric fat amount is less. 
 In addition, Fig. 9 shows the impact heavy on the liver of the mice using the high fat diet of probiotic bacteria process to feed.Do not observe significant difference, again show weight differences and liver is heavily irrelevant. 
 Body weight increases 
 The body weight that Figure 10 showed before and after mice administration of probiotics of feeding for high fat diet increases.The body weight of the mice of B420 and B420+NCFM process increases all lower than not using the HFD of probiotic bacteria process to feed mice or be used alone the mice of NCFM process.Independent B420 or its obtain statistically significant result with the combination of NCFM: separately NCFM observes downward trend (feeding compared with mice with untreated HFD). 
 Blood insulin concentration 
 Evaluate the blood insulin concentration on an empty stomach and under fed conditions.Data show, and under fasted conditions, the feature of B420 processed group is empty stomach hyperinsulinemia normalization (Figure 11).Under state, institute's profitable probliotics process all improves glucose insulin secretion on the feed. 
 These result tool significances, reason observes low-level insulin (i.e. the insulin of foundation level) in the health, non-diabetic experimenter of fasted conditions.Independent B420 observes statistically significant result. 
 There is further significantly meaning, observe high-caliber insulin in the health of state, non-diabetic experimenter on the feed.Independent B420, separately NCFM and the combination of both all obtain statistically significant result. 
 Insulin sensitivity 
 Figure 12 is shown the mice fed by the high fat diet of blood glucose clamp method clamp under the positive glucose state of hyperinsulinism.The feature of the mice of data display B420 process is insulin sensitivity normalization.
         * p < 0.05 compared with HFD mice.But, under NCFM exists, do not observe this effect.
       
 These result tool significances, reason is that insulin sensitivity provides insulin behavior and associating between glucose consumption.The result of B420 display has special significance, and reason is that compared with the classical antidiabetic drug with only targeting fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity or insulin of taking food, it all has impact for all of these factors taken together. 
 Liver tissues inflammatory 
 When considering the mRNA concentration of all cells factor, the inflammation (Figure 13 and 14) of HFD induced liver tissue.Probiotic bacteria process has obvious anti-inflammatory effect to liver organization.This is with especially obvious during NCFM process.Further, use NCFM and B420 combined treatment to reduce alleviating of inflammation, and separately B420 process to inflammation to alleviate degree lower. 
 Muscular tissue inflammation 
 High fat diet is incite inflammation in muscular tissue also, but this inflammation-induced is not as strong like that in fatty tissue (Figure 15 and 16).Use the probiotic bacteria process of B420+NCFM and independent NCFM to tend to reduce muscular tissue inflammation, but effect not as to fatty tissue or hepatic tissue obvious like that. 
 Fatty tissue inflammation 
 High fat diet obviously induces subcutaneus adipose tissue inflammation (Figure 17 and 18).B420 process and B420+NCFM process all show strong anti-inflammatory effect.Use NCFM process to cause the effect more inconsistent to tissue inflammation, but there is the common trend reduced inflammation. 
 Generally speaking, probiotic bacteria shows anti-inflammatory effect widely, and it has in fatty tissue and hepatic tissue affects the most significantly.It should be noted that anti-inflammatory effect has diversity, and depend on tissue and probiotic bacteria process.
