   2. Description of the Related Art 
   
    
    [0003]
     Soybeans are an abundant crop source of vegetable proteins, and contain not only proteins, but also a variety of excellent functional materials including unsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, isoflavones, and phenolic acids. In this regard, soybeans are being used as a protein source to replace animal proteins. 
     
    
    [0004]
     Researchers,  CHA, Baecheon et al. (The Korean Society of Pharmacognosy, Vol. 27(3): pages 190-195 (published in 1996 )), discovered that an extract obtained by performing an extraction process (hereinafter referred to as an ethanol extract) on a wild-type soybean Glycine soja Siebold et Zucc. by using ethanol contains (-)-epicatechin, unlike an ethanol extract of another soybean soybean  Glycine max  (L.) Merrill. In addition, the researchers also discovered that the ethanol extract of the wild-type soybean has antioxidative activity, but did not disclose that the soybean contains ()-epicatechin. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Therefore, there is a demand for a new soybean cultivar having excellent prevention or improvement function of inflammation, compared to the known soybeans, or for a composition including an extract obtained from the new soybean cultivar.

     Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the following Examples. However, these Examples are for illustrative purposes only, and the scope of the present disclosure is not intended to be limited thereby. 
   
 Examples 1: Breeding and characteristics of  new cultivar   
 
 
 1. Breeding of cultivar 
 
   
    
    [0048]
     20 soybean seed grains, which are black flat-shaped granules collected as genetic resources from Idong-eup, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, were prepared. As a result of cultivating the soybean seeds, separation occurred in terms of shape and color of the flowers, and in this regard, it was confirmed that the traits of the soybean seeds were not fixed. For example, the flower color appeared separately as white or pink. In this regard, the traits of the soybean seeds did not seem to be fixed, and thus, the soybean seeds were not recognized as species due to lack of stability and uniformity. 
     
    
    [0049]
     Therefore, the inventors of the present disclosure bred a cultivar by using the soybean seeds according to a pure line selection breeding method. The pure line selection was carried out from 2013 to 2017, and more particularly, it was carried out by the whole crop experimental field in the Rural Development Administration (RDA): National Institute of Crop Science (NICS) located in Suwon, Republic of Korea from 2013 to 2014, and then, in the field located in Iseo-myeon, Wanju-gun, Republic of Korea from 2015 to 2017. 
     
    
    [0050]
     A specific process of the pure line selection from the collected genetic resources of the soybean is as follows: as genetic resources, 20 soybean seeds were sown at the beginning of June every year from 2013 to 2016 in the experimental field affiliated with the RDA; then, 1 seed was selected for the purity improvement at the end of November and then harvested as a sowing seed for the following year. After four years of the pure line selection process, one finally fixed pure line seed was selected. 
     
    
    [0051]
     To confirm uniformity, traits, such as hypocotyl color, flower color, trichome color, legume color, leaf shape, growth type, flowering periods, and maturity, were examined every year. In the pure line separation process performed on the collected genetic resources, separation was observed in the hypocotyls color and the flower color in 2013, whereas no separation was observed with respect to the other traits. In addition, the progeny selected in 2013 was found to maintain uniformity in target traits among traits examined from 2014 to 2017. The distinguishable features between a standard cultivar (named Wonheug) and a control cultivar (named Cheongja-3) are clearly shown in Table 1 in terms of growth type, days to flowering, hypocotyl color, weight of 100 beans, and leaf shape. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the finally selected pure line. In Table 1, the finally selected line (cultivar) was named SCEL-1. FIG. 4 is a photograph of seeds of the finally selected cultivar SCEL-1.
   [Table 1]       Source   Growth type (determin ate, indetermin ate)   Number of days to flowering   Flower color (violet or white)   Hypocotyl color (violet or green)   Trichome color (brown, light gray)   Testa   Hilum color   100-seed weight (g)   Leaf shape         Wonheug (standard)   Determinate   66   Violet   Violet   Brown   Black   Black   11.6   Globular       Cheongja-3 (control)   Determinate   70   Violet   Violet   Brown   Black   Black   40.7   Globular       Selected cultivar (SCEL-1)   Indeterminate   58   White   Green   Brown   Black   Black   8.8   Oblique ellipse           
   
 2. Identification of cultivar characteristics relative to control cultivar 
 
   
    
    [0052]
     To compare the agricultural performance of the finally selected pure line cultivar SCEL-1 relative to the existing cultivars, the performance of each cultivar was identified by repeating the randomized block design three times by using the Wonheug bean as a standard cultivar and Cheongja-3 as a control cultivar in the field affiliated with the NISC in summer of 2017. Here, the agronomic traits of each cultivar were examined by cultivating plants after sowing two seeds per hole (60 cm X 15 cm) containing four rows (4 meters long) in an experimental plot on June 8, 2017, and then cultivating the seeds. The Wonheug bean (Cultivar Application Publication Number: 2010-341) is a microcarpa bean cultivar with a black seed coat developed by the NICS in 2009, and is currently the most cultivated cultivar in farming. The Wonheug bean is similar to the selected cultivar SCEL-1, and thus, may be used as a standard cultivar for the comparison. The control cultivar, Cheongja-3 (Cultivar Application Publication Number: 2005-176), was developed by the NICS in 2004 and is a soybean cultivar that has a black seed coat, is large-sized, and is used for cooking with rice. The Wonheug bean and Cheongja-3 are commercially available from the Korean Seed and Variety Service (KSVS) or the like.

     Referring to Tables 2 and 3, it was found from the examination that the selected cultivar was longer than the standard cultivar, Wonheug, by 26 cm, and had one more node than the standard cultivar, Wonheug. In addition, regarding the number of branches, it was found from the examination that the selected cultivar was had about 6.4 branches similar to the standard cultivar, and regarding the number of pods, the constitution ratio of the 1-pod, 2-pods, and 3-pods was similar to the standard cultivar. Regarding the total number of pods, the number of grains, the yield per plant, and the yield per area, which indicate the yield component traits, the selected cultivar had 184 pods, 397 grains, 23.1 g of the yield per plant, and 4.6 g of the yield per are, wherein the resulting numbers and yields were lower than those of the standard cultivar. Here, 100 grains were weighed at 9.4 g, and in this regard, the selected cultivar had small grains as compared with the standard cultivar. When the yield per 10a was calculated based on the results above, the selected cultivar showed 413 kg/10 a, which was only about 70% of the yield per 10a of the standard cultivar, Wonheug. However, the amounts of procyanidin B2 and epicatechin, which are functional substances, were about 301% and 217%, respectively. In detail, the amount of procyanidin B2 was 149.4 ug/100 mg, 49.5 ug/100 mg, and 34.3 ug/100 mg in the selected cultivar SCEL-1, Wonheug, and Cheongja-3, respectively. The amount of epicatechin was 46.9 ug/100 mg, 21.6 ug/100 mg, and 20.1 ug/100 mg in the selected cultivar SCEL-1, Wonheug, and Cheongja-3, respectively. Here, the amounts of procyanidin B2 and epicatechin were confirmed by an extraction process performed according to the method of  Section  1 in Example 2. 
     
    
    [0056]
     According to the experiments, the cultivar SCEL-1 was found to have high uniformity and was distinguished from the standard cultivar and the existing cultivars by the comparison, and was also able to be recognized as an independent cultivar with distinct characteristics in terms of the agronomic traits, the yield ability, and the functional material contents. 
     
    
    [0057]
     This newly selected cultivar of a black small-sized bean having an oblique ellipse shape was named SCEL-1, and was deposited with the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection(KACC), which is an International Depository Authority(IDA) under the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure under the accession number KACC 88002BP on November 8, 2018.  FIG. 1  shows a schematic breeding diagram of a soybean cultivar according to the present disclosure. 
   
 Example 2: Extract obtained by performing an extraction process on a newly selected soybean seed by using water, alcohol, or a mixture, and use of the extract 
 
   
    
    [0058]
     In this Example, an extract was prepared from a seed of the newly selected soybean cultivar SCEL-1 of Example 1, and an effect of the extract was identified. 
   
 1. Preparation of an extract 
 
   
    
    [0059]
     Immediately before analyzing a seed of the selected cultivar, the seed was pulverized by using a high-speed pulverizer (Wonder Blender, 820W, 30000 RPM, Sanplatec Corp) to prepare powdered seed. 1 g of the powdered seed thus obtained was mixed with 100 ml of 70 (v/v)% aqueous ethanol in a glass tube, and the mixed solution was stirred at a temperature of 50 °C for 6 hours by using a magnetic bar. Then, the resulting extract was filtered through filter paper (Garde No.131 Qualitative filter paper, Advantec). 
     
    
    [0060]
     Afterwards, the ethanol layer was dried in a nitrogen gas drier (hurricane-Eagle, Chongmin Technology) for 1 hour, and then, was lyophilized for one day to completely remove moisture, thereby obtaining 0.19 g (standard deviation SD: ±0.015) of a soybean extract. In the experiments, for use of the soybean extract, it was dissolved at a concentration of 30 mg/ml in 50% v/v ethanol, and was subjected to the HPLC analysis. 
   
 2. Confirmation of inflammation improving effect 
 
 
 (1) Improvement of skin inflammation by oral administration 
 
   
    
    [0061]
     When orally administering the extract obtained in  Section  1, the efficacy of the extract of improving skin inflammation induced by ultraviolet rays was confirmed through an experiment using a nude mouse model. 
     
    
    [0062]
     8-week-old nude mice (OrientBio, SKH-1 species, and average weight of 26.2 g) were divided into two groups, each having seven mice. Here, one group is a control group, and the other group is a test group. In the test group, based on a weight, 2.5 mg/10 ml and 5.0 mg/10 ml of an extracted solution were each administered to a mouse to be 25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively, wherein the extracted solution was obtained by dissolving the lyophilized extract of  Section  1 in an aqueous solution containing 2 % ethanol, 1 % Tween 80, and 0.8 % carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). In the control group, based on a volume, an aqueous solution containing 2 % ethanol, 1 % Tween 80, and 0.8 % CMC was administered to a mouse. Here, the administration was performed by direct administration to the stomach of the mouse using an oral zoned. In this regard, the soybean extract was able to be administered to the mouse at doses of 25 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day. 
     
    
    [0063]
     After the administration of the extract, ultraviolet ray was irradiated to the mouse. In detail, to individual mice in each of the control group and the test group, 1 minimal erythema dose (MED) of ultraviolet ray was irradiated three times a week for two weeks, 2 MEDs of ultraviolet ray was irradiated three times a week for two weeks, 3 MEDs of ultraviolet ray was irradiated twice a week for two weeks, and 4 MEDs of ultraviolet ray was irradiated twice a week for two weeks. That is, the irradiation was performed for a total of eight weeks. Afterwards, the skin tissue of the nude mouse out of the experiment was treated with formalin. Then, to measure infiltration of inflammatory cells, the treated skin tissue was stained with toluidine blue, and the results are shown in  FIG. 1  and Table 4. In Table 4 and  FIG. 1 , the number of master cells that are inflammatory cells existing after the extract of soybean SCEL-1 was administered to the mouse are shown.
   [Table 4]       Sample   Oral dose (mg/kg/day)   Number of master cells/dermis (%)           Untreated group     0   49.1 ± 4.7       UVB (40 mJ/cm 2 )-induced  group     0   93.2 ± 9.3       Soybean SCEL-1   25   82.5 ± 7.1       50   73.5 ± 4.2         Black soybean     25   93.8 ± 8.9       50   87.5 ± 7.1       Small  black soybean     25   88.5 ± 12.8       50   82.9 ± 13.9           
     
    
    [0064]
     Referring to Table 4 and  FIG. 1 , a test group treated with the soybean SCEL-1 showed that the activity of reducing and restoring the skin inflammation induced by ultraviolet irradiation was significantly better than that of general black soybeans. 
     
    
    [0065]
     Referring Table 4, the general black soybean which is similar to Cheongja-3 was purchased at Nonghyup of Gyeongpo branch in Gangneung, Republic of Korea. The Rhynchosia nulubilis which was similar to Wonheug was purchased at Nonghyup of Chiak Mountain branch in Wonju, Republic of Korea. The extract of each sample was obtained by the same extraction process performed on the soybean SCEL-1. 
     
    
    [0066]
     From the results above, it was confirmed that the oral administration of the extract of soybean SCEL-1 showed excellent effects in preventing the destruction of the skin tissue or anti-skin inflammation, each induced by ultraviolet ray. 
   
 (2) Treatment of atopic dermatitis 
 
   
    
    [0067]
     In a mouse, oxazolone was administered thereoto to induce an oxazolone-induced atopic dermatitis. Then, the effect of the extract of the selected cultivar on atopic dermatitis was examined. 
     
    
    [0068]
     In detail, mice (male, 20 g, 8-week-old, Central Lab. Animal Inc.) was divided into a group of 6, and each group was named as a control group, a induction group (Vehicle), a positive control group (Dexa), a soybean SCEL-1 0.1 %(w/v)-treated group, a soybean SCEL-1 0.3 %(w/v)-treated group, a SCEL-1 1.0 %(w/v)-treated group, and a general black soybean (available from Nonghyup of Gangneungkyo-1-dong) 1.0 %(w/v)-treated group. Each sample was prepared in the same manner as in Section (1). 
     
    
    [0069]
     To induce atopic dermatitis in mice, 40 µℓ of 1 % oxazolone per ear was applied once a day. After one week and starting from the eighth day, 40 µℓ of 1 % oxazolone per ear was applied on alternate days for three weeks. In addition, starting from the eighth day, in addition to the oxazolone application, samples were also applied twice a day. Immediately after the experiment, a tissue of the ear was immobilized in 10 % paraformaldehyde for 24 hours or more, and then, immersed in paraffin to form a block. The block was then fixed, and cut to a thickness of 10 µm by using a microtome that enables cutting to a constant thickness. A section of the obtained tissue was adhered to a glass slide, deparaffinized, and then, stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for the observation with an optimal microscope. Accordingly, the induction and mitigation efficacy on atopic dermatitis was histologically confirmed. 
     
    
    [0070]
       FIG. 2  is a diagram showing the effect of the extract of the selected soybean cultivar on the ear thickness of the mouse having oxazolone-induced atopic dermatitis, when the extract was administered to the mouse. As shown in  FIG. 2 , a thickness of the ear skin was significantly increased due to inflammation when animal inflammation was induced. When treated with dexamethanosone (Dex) which is an anti-inflammatory drug used for skin inflammation, it was confirmed that a thickness of the ear skin was reduced to a thickness near the normal level. Furthermore, it was confirmed that, when treated with the extract of the selected soybean cultivar at 1% which is low as compared to the inflammation-induced group, the ear thickness was significantly reduced by the inflammation. Meanwhile, it was also observed that, when treated with the extract of the general black soybean at 1% which is the same level as the extract of the selected soybean cultivar, the extract of the general black soybean at was not able to reduce the ear thickness that was increased by the inflammation. 
     
    
    [0071]
     According to the results above, it was confirmed that the extract of the selected soybean cultivar exhibits effects of treating inflammation. 
   
 3. Analysis of components of soybean extract 
 
   
    
    [0072]
     The soybean extract was subjected to mass spectrometry, so as to analyze active ingredients in the soybean extract. 
     
    
    [0073]
     In detail, the analysis of components in the soybean extract was carried out by using an Agilent 1260 HPLC system and a Bruker MicrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer. Here, for the column analysis, a Prevail C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um), Solvent A of a mobile phase consisting of 95% water/5% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid), and Solvent B of a mobile phase consisting of 95% acetonitrile/5% water (0.1% formic acid) were used. Here, the flow rate of the solvent was set at 0.7 ml/min, and the concentration gradient conditions of the solvent used for the separation of components are shown in Table 5.
   [Table 5]       Time (min)   A(%)   B(%)   Flow rate (ml/min)   Maximum pressure (bar)         0.00   95.00   5.00   0.700   1000.00       3.00   95.00   5.00   0.700   1000.00       23.00   50.00   50.00   0.700   1000.00       28.00   0.00   100.00   0.700   1000.00       33.00   0.00   100.00   0.700   1000.00       33.10   95.00   5.00   0.700   1000.00       40.00   95.00   5.00   0.700   1000.00           
     
    
    [0074]
     Here, the temperature of the column was maintained at 35 °C, and 10 µL of the sample was injected into the column. A mass spectrometer was used to analyze ingredients contained in the soybean extract under conditions of mode: ESI(+); mass range: 50 m/z to 800 m/z; nebulizing gas: 8 L/min; source gas temperature: 180 °C; capillary voltage: +4,500 V; and cone voltage: 35 V. 
     
    
    [0075]
     As a result, the amount of each of epicatechin and procyanidin B2 contained in the selected cultivar named SCEL-1 was in a range of about 0.32% to about 0.46% and in a range of about 1.0% to about 2.0%, respectively, which was significantly higher than the amounts thereof in Wonheug, which were respectively in a range of about 0.14% to about 0.15 % and in a range of about 0.33% to about 0.35%. 
     
    
    [0076]
     In cultivar named SCEL-1 selected on the basis of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside which is a representative substance of anthocyanin antioxidants, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, procyanidin B2, and epicatechin were contained at a ratio of 1: 2.0 to 2.1 : 0.43 to 0.48. Meanwhile, in Wonheug, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, procyanidin B2, and epicatechin were contained at a ratio of 1: 0.43 to 0.70 : 0.19 to 0.25.
