In humans, three members of this family have been identified, and some of their properties characterized (Clements, Endoc. 
 Rev, 10, 343 (1989); Clements, Mol. Cell Endo., 92, 1 (1994); Jones et al., Acta Endoc., 122, 481 (1992)). The hKLKI gene encodes the tissue kallikrein protein, hKl, the hKLK2 gene encodes the prostate-specific glandular kallikrein protein, hK2, and the hKLK3 gene encodes the prostate-specific antigen protein, hK3 (PSA). Northern blot analysis ofmRNA shows that both hK2 and PSA are expressed mainly in the human prostate, while expression of hK1 is found in the pancreas, submandibular gland, kidney, and other nonprostate tissues (Chapdelaine et al., FEBS Lett., 236, 205 (1988); Young et al., Biochem. 31, 818 (1992)). 
 The nucleotide sequence homology between the exons of hKLK2 and hKLK3 is 80%, whereas the nucleotide sequence homology between the exons of hKLK2 and hKLK1 is 65%. The deduced amino acid sequence homology of hK2 to PSA is 78%, whereas the deduced amino acid sequence homology of hK2 to hK1 is 57%. Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence of hK2 suggests that hK2 may be a trypsin-like protease, whereas PSA is a chymotrypsin-like protease. 
 PSA levels are widely used as a prognostic indicator of prostate carcinoma. However, since the concentration of PSA in serum is elevated in patients with either prostatic cancer (PCa) or benign prostatic hyperplasia  
 (BPH), 
 the detection of elevated levels of PSA does not distinguish between these diseases. 
 Moreover, the high degree of homology of hK2 to PSA raises some question as to the specificity of antibodies currently used to detect the levels of ZU/il VOU MON 17:25 FAX 61 3 9243 8333 GRA3FITH HACK 0116 61 3 9243 8333 -2- PSA. If the levels Of circulating hK2 are unrelated to pCa or BPH, then antibodies raised to preparations of PSA which are contaminated with HK2, or to regions of PSA with homology hK2, can result in false Positive results. 
 However, determination of the levels of hK2 in serum, and the correlation of those levels in patients with pCa or BPH, have not been accomplished. 
 Thus, a need exists for improved methods and reagents for the diagnosis of pCa, BPH or related conditions.

 Summary of the Invention The invention provides a diagnostic method comprising contacting an amount of purified antibodies which specifically bind to phK2 or hK2 with a sample of physiological fluid obtained from a human. The physiological fluid comprises hK2 or phK2. The antibodies are contacted with the sample for a sufficient time to allow the formation of binary complexes between at least a portion of said antibodies and a portion of phK2 or hK2, wherein said antibodies do not significantly react with hK3. The presence of one or both of said complexes in said samrple is then detected, and the amount thereof is correlated to the presence or absence of prostate cancer. 
 The amount of one or both of said complexes can be compared to a standard amount that is representative, for examnple, T of the amount of one or both complexes in a control sample RECEIVED TIME 20,NOV. 16:18 RECEVED IME 0.

Likewise, the amount can be compared to a standard amount that represents a.cut-off, above which or below which further evaluation for prostate cancer is carried out, and below which or above which, respectively, the human is likely to be cancer-free. This assay is based on the discovery that phK2 is detected in the supernatant of a prostate carcinoma cell line and that hK2 is present in human physiological fluid from prostate cancer patients. Thus, this method is useful for monitoring the treatment and/or progression of prostate cancer, or for the early detection of prostate cancer. 
 As used herein, a human "at risk of" prostate cancer is a male who has benign prostatic hyperplasia  
 (BPH)

 PSA (hK3) forms covalently-linked complexes with anti-chymotrypsin (ACT) and alpha 2 -macroglobulin (MG) in human serum (Leinonen et al., Clin. 
 Chem., 34, 2098 (1993)). Monitoring the ratios of different forms of PSA (complexed versus uncomplexed) in serum has been useful in differentiating between BPH and pCa (Christensson et al., J. Urol., 150, 100 (1993)). 
 The results presented hereinbelow show that hK2 polypeptides also form complexes with ACT and MG. Complex formation of hK2 with ACT was unexpected since hK2 is a trypsin-like protease and ACT is typically an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases. However, it suggests that hK2 bears conformational/structural similarities with PSA (hK3) which dictate its reactivity with inhibitors. hK2 complexed with ACT and MG along with free (unbound) hK2 would thus be expected to represent the major immunologically detectable or measurable components of hK2 in human serum. The results presented hereinbelow also show that hK2 complexes can be detected in the sera of prostatic cancer patients. Therefore, monitoring for the presence and/or amount of hK2 complexes may also be important in distinguishing between PCa and 
 BPH. 
 Thus, the invention also provides a diagnostic method comprising determining the amount of hK2 polypeptide which is bound to plasma protein from a sample of human physiological fluid and correlating the amount of said bound hK2 polypeptide to the presence or absence of prostate cancer in said human. A preferred embodiment of the invention is a diagnostic method in which the amount of bound hK2 polypeptide is determined relative to a value representative of said amount of bound hK2 in a human not at risk of, or afflicted with, prostate cancer. Another preferred embodiment of the invention is a diagnostic method comprising separating from a sample of human physiological fluid hK2 polypeptide which is bound to plasma protein from hK2 polypeptide which is not bound to plasma protein prior to determining the amount of bound WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 4 hK2 polypeptide. Methodologies for the separation of proteins of differing molecular weights and/or conformations is well known to the art. 
 Further provided is a method to detect hK2 complex formation with plasma proteins. The method comprises determining the amount of hK2 polypeptide which is bound to plasma protein relative to the amount of hK2 polypeptide which is not bound to plasma protein. Alternatively, the amount of hK2 polypeptide which is bound to plasma protein relative to the total hK2 polypeptide (bound plus unbound) is determined. 
 The invention further provides a method for detecting or determining unbound hK2 polypeptide in a sample of a human physiological fluid containing hK2. The method comprises contacting an amount of purified antibodies which specifically bind to hK2 with the sample to be tested for a sufficient time to allow the formation of binary complexes between at least a portion of said antibodies and a portion of said hK2. The antibodies do not significantly react with hK3 and do not significantly react with hK2 which is bound to a plasma protein. A preferred embodiment of the invention includes attaching said antibodies to a solid surface prior to contacting the antibodies with the sample to be tested. 
 Also provided is a purified antibody that specifically binds an hK2 polypeptide and does not bind hK3, wherein the antibody also binds to hK2 which is bound to a plasma protein. 
 The invention further provides a diagnostic kit for detecting or determining phK2 or hK2. The kit comprises packaging, containing, separately packaged a solid phase which binds a capture antibody; and a known amount of a detection antibody, wherein the detection antibody specifically binds to phK2 or to hK2 and not to hK3. 
 Another embodiment of the invention is a diagnostic kit for detecting or determining phK2. The kit comprises packaging, containing, separately packaged a solid phase which binds a capture antibody; and a known amount of a detection antibody, wherein the detection antibody specifically binds the pro form of hK2 and not hK3 or hK2. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 Yet another embodiment of the invention is a diagnostic kit for detecting or determining phK2 or hK2. The kit comprises packaging, containing, separately packaged a solid phase which binds a capture antibody; and a known amount of the capture antibody, wherein the capture antibody specifically binds to phK2 or to hK2 and not to hK3. 
 Also provided is a method of detecting hK2 in vitro. The method comprises contacting a sample, such as a fluid sample, comprising an amount of an hK2 polypeptide with an amount of a peptide substrate for a sufficient time to allow cleavage of the peptide substrate by the hK2 polypeptide to yield subunits of the peptide, wherein the peptide substrate comprises contiguous amino acid residues which form a site to which an hK2 polypeptide binds. Then the presence or amount of the subunits of the peptide substrate is determined. 
 Preferably, the peptide substrate is a synthetic peptide.

 Detailed Description of the Invention The high degree of amino acid sequence homology of hK2 to PSA, and the fact that the expression of both hK2 and PSA is essentially limited to the prostate, suggests that measuring the serum concentrations of both proteins can be useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of prostatic cancer (pCa). Recently, pphK2 was expressed in bacteria (Saedi et al., Mol. Cell. Endoc., 109, 237 (1995)). Bacterially derived pphK2 can be used to generate antibodies to the non-conformationally dependent epitopes on hK2. However, to discern the steps involved in the biosynthesis of hK2 and to obtain antibodies specific for the fully processed and secreted form of hK2, expression of hK2 in mammalian cells is necessary. 
 As used herein, the term "hK2 polypeptide" includes recombinant prepro, pro and mature hK2 polypeptides. A mature hK2 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO: as well as "variant" polypeptides which share at least 90% homology with SEQ ID NO:1 in the regions which are substantially homologous with hK3, which regions are not identified by bars as shown in Figure 1. Such hK2 polypeptides also possess antigenic function in common with the mature hK2 molecule of Figure 1, in that said polypeptides are also definable by antibodies which bind specifically thereto, but which do not cross-react with hK3 (or hKl). Preferably, said antibodies react with antigenic sites or epitopes that are also present on the mature hK2 molecule of Figure 1. Antibodies useful to define common antigenic function are described in detail in Serial No. 08/096,946, i.e., polyclonal antisera prepared in vivo against hK2 subunit 41-56. 
 "Isolated hK2 nucleic acid" is RNA or DNA containing greater than preferably 20 or more, sequential nucleotide bases that encode a biologically active hK2 polypeptide or a variant fragment thereof, that is complementary to WO 98/02748 PCT/IS97/12322 12 the non-coding strand of the native hK2 polypeptide RNA or DNA, or hybridizes to said RNA or DNA and remains stably bound under stringent conditions. 
 Thus, the RNA or DNA is isolated in that it is free from at least one contaminating nucleic acid with which it is normally associated in the natural source of the nucleic acid and is preferably substantially free of any other mammalian RNA or DNA. The phrase "free from at least one contaminating source nucleic acid with which it is normally associated" includes the case where the nucleic acid is reintroduced into the source or natural cell but is in a different chromosomal location or is otherwise flanked by nucleic acid sequences not normally found in the source cell. An example of isolated hK2 nucleic acid is RNA or DNA that encodes a biologically active hK2 polypeptide sharing at least sequence identity with the hK3-homologous regions of the hK2 peptide of Figure 1, as described above. The term "isolated, substantially homogenous" as used with respect to an hK2 polypeptide is defined in terms of the methodologies discussed herein below. 
 As used herein, the term "recombinant nucleic acid," "recombinant DNA" refers to a nucleic acid, to DNA that has been derived or isolated from any appropriate tissue source, that may be subsequently chemically altered in vitro, and later introduced into target host cells, such as cells derived from animal, plant, insect, yeast, fungal or bacterial sources. An example of recombinant DNA "derived" from a source, would be a DNA sequence that is identified as a useful fragment encoding hK2, or a fragment or variant thereof, and which is then chemically synthesized in essentially pure form. An example of such DNA "isolated" from a source would be a useful DNA sequence that is excised or removed from said source by chemical means, e.g, by the use of restriction endonucleases, so that it can be further manipulated, amplified, for use in the invention, by the methodology of genetic engineering. 
 Therefore, "recombinant DNA" includes completely synthetic  
 DNA 
 sequences, semi-synthetic DNA sequences, DNA sequences isolated from biological sources, and DNA sequences derived from introduced RNA, as well as mixtures thereof. Generally, the recombinant DNA sequence is not originally WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 13 resident in the genome of the host target cell which is the recipient of the DNA, or it is resident in the genome but is not expressed, or not highly expressed. 
 As used herein, "chimeric" means that a vector comprises DNA from at least two different species, or comprises DNA from the same species, which is linked or associated in a manner which does not occur in the "native" or wild type of the species. 
 The recombinant DNA sequence, used for transformation herein, may be circular or linear, double-stranded or single-stranded. Generally, the DNA sequence is in the form of chimeric DNA, such as plasmid DNA, that can also contain coding regions flanked by control sequences which promote the expression of the recombinant DNA present in the resultant cell line. For example, the recombinant DNA may itself comprise a promoter that is active in mammalian cells, or may utilize a promoter already present in the genome that is the transformation target. Such promoters include the CMV promoter, as well as the SV40 late promoter and retroviral LTRs (long terminal repeat elements). 
 Aside from recombinant DNA sequences that serve as transcription units for hK2 or portions thereof, a portion of the recombinant DNA may be untranscribed, serving a regulatory or a structural function. 
 "Control sequences" is defined to mean DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. 
 The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotic cells, for example, include a promoter, and optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers. 
 "Operably linked" is defined to mean that the nucleic acids are placed in a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example,  
 DNA 
 for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 14 translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accord with conventional practice. 
 Aside from recombinant DNA sequences that serve as transcription units for hK2 or portions thereof, a portion of the recombinant DNA may be untranscribed, serving a regulatory or a structural function. 
 The recombinant DNA to be introduced into the cells further will generally contain either a selectable marker gene or a reporter gene or both to facilitate identification and selection of transformed cells from the population of cells sought to be transformed. Alternatively, the selectable marker may be carried on a separate piece of DNA and used in a co-transformation procedure. 
 Both selectable markers and reporter genes may be flanked with appropriate regulatory sequences to enable expression in the host cells. Useful selectable markers are well known in the art and include, for example, antibiotic and herbicide-resistance genes, such as neo, hpt, dhfr, bar, aroA, dapA and the like. 
 Reporter genes are used for identifying potentially transformed cells and for evaluating the functionality of regulatory sequences. Reporter genes which encode for easily assayable proteins are well known in the art. In general, a :.reporter gene is a gene which is not present in or expressed by the recipient organism or tissue and which encodes a protein whose expression is manifested by some easily detectable property, enzymatic activity. Preferred genes include the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) from Tn9 of E. coli, the beta-glucuronidase gene (gus) of the uidA locus ofE. coli, and the luciferase gene from firefly Photinuspyralis. Expression of the reporter gene is assayed at a suitable time after the DNA has been introduced into the recipient cells. 
 Other elements functional in the host cells, such as introns, enhancers, polyadenylation sequences and the like, may also be a part of the recombinant DNA. Such elements may or may not be necessary for the function of the DNA, WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 but may provide improved expression of the DNA by affecting transcription, stability of the mRNA, or the like. Such elements may be included in the DNA as desired to obtain the optimal performance of the transforming DNA in the cell. 
 The general methods for constructing recombinant DNA which can transform target cells are well known to those skilled in the art, and the same compositions and methods of construction may be utilized to produce the DNA useful herein. For example, J. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2d ed., 1989), provides suitable methods of construction. 
 The recombinant DNA can be readily introduced into the target cells by transfection with an expression vector comprising cDNA encoding hK2, for example, by the modified calcium phosphate precipitation procedure of C. Chen et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 7, 2745 (1987). Transfection can also be accomplished by lipofectin, using commercially available kits, provided by BRL. 
 Suitable host cells for the expression of hK2 polypeptide are derived from multicellular organisms. Such host cells are capable of complex processing and glycosylation activities. In principle, any higher eukaryotic cell culture can be employed in the practice of the invention, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as Spodopterafrugiperda (caterpillar), Aedes aegypti (mosquito), Aedes albopictus (mosquito), Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly), and Bombyx mori have been identified. See, Luckow et al., Bio/Technology, 6, 47 (1988); Miller et al., in Genetic Engineering, J. K. Setlow et al., eds., Vol. 8 (Plenum Publishing, 1986), pp. 277-279; and Maeda et al., Nature, 592 (1985). A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, the L-1 variant of Autographa californica NPV and the strain of Bombyx mori NPV, and such viruses may be used, preferably for transfection of Spodopterafrugiperda cells. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 16 Recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest can employ separation of the digest on polyacrylamide or agarose gel by electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment, and separation of the gel from DNA. For example, see Lawn et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 9, 6103 (1981), and Goeddel et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 4057 (1980). 
 "Southern analysis" or "Southern blotting" is a method by which the presence of DNA sequences in a restriction endonuclease digest of DNA or DNA-containing composition is confirmed by hybridization to a known, labeled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment. Southern analysis typically involves electrophoretic separation of DNA digests on agarose gels, denaturation of the DNA after electrophoretic separation, and transfer of the DNA to nitrocellulose, nylon, or another suitable membrane support for analysis with a radiolabeled, biotinylated, or enzyme-labeled probe as described in sections 9.37-9.52 of Sambrook et al., supra. 
 "Northern analysis" or "Northern blotting" is a method used to identify RNA sequences that hybridize to a known probe such as an oligonucleotide, DNA fragment, cDNA or fragment thereof, or RNA fragment. The probe is labeled with a radioisotope such as 32 P, by biotinylation or with an enzyme. The RNA to be analyzed can be usually electrophoretically separated on an agarose :or polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, nylon, or other suitable membrane, and hybridized with the probe, using standard techniques well known in the art such as those described in sections 7.39-7.52 of Sambrook et al., supra. 
 "Polymerase chain reaction" or "PCR" refers to a procedure or technique in which amounts of a preselected fragment of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,683,195. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond is employed to design oligonucleotide primers. These primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 17 DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, and the like. See generally Mullis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp uant. Biol. 5, 263 (1987); Erlich, ed., PCR Technology, (Stockton Press, NY, 1989). 
 "Stringent conditions" are those that employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example, 0.015 M NaCI/0.0015 M sodium citrate (SSC); 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS) at 50 0 C, or employ a denaturing agent such as formamide during hybridization, 50% formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM NaCI, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42 0 C. Another example is use of 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (0.75 M NaCI, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5 x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA pg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42 0 C, with washes at 42 0 C in 0.2 x SSC and 0.1% SDS. 
 When hK2 polypeptide is expressed in a recombinant cell other than one of human origin, the hK2 polypeptide is completely free of proteins or polypeptides of human origin. However, it is necessary to purify hK2 polypeptide from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous as to hK2 polypeptide. For example, the culture medium or lysate can be centrifuged to remove particulate cell debris. The membrane and soluble protein fractions are then separated. The hK2 polypeptide may then be purified from the soluble protein fraction and, if necessary, from the membrane fraction of the culture lysate. hK2 polypeptide can then be purified from contaminant soluble proteins and polypeptides by fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on an anion-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; or ligand affinity chromatography. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 18 Once isolated from the resulting transgenic host cells, derivatives and variants of the hK2 polypeptide can be readily prepared. For example, amides of the hK2 polypeptides of the present invention may also be prepared by techniques well known in the art for converting a carboxylic acid group or precursor, to an amide. A preferred method for amide formation at the Cterminal carboxyl group is to cleave the polypeptide from a solid support with an appropriate amine, or to cleave in the presence of an alcohol, yielding an ester, followed by aminolysis with the desired amine. 
 Salts of carboxyl groups of the hK2 polypeptide may be prepared in the usual manner by contacting the peptide with one or more equivalents of a desired base such as, for example, a metallic hydroxide base, sodium hydroxide; a metal carbonate or bicarbonate base such as, for example, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate; or an amine base such as, for example, triethylamine, triethanolamine, and the like. 
 N-acyl derivatives of an amino group of the present polypeptides may be prepared by utilizing an N-acyl protected amino acid for the final condensation, or by acylating a protected or unprotected peptide. O-acyl derivatives may be prepared, for example, by acylation of a free hydroxy peptide or peptide resin. 
 Either acylation may be carried out using standard acylating reagents such as acyl halides, anhydrides, acyl imidazoles, and the like. Both N- and O-acylation may be carried out together, if desired. In addition, the internal hK2 amino acid sequence of Figure 1 can be modified by substituting one or two conservative amino acid substitutions for the positions specified, including substitutions which utilize the D rather than L form. The invention is also directed to variant or modified forms of the hK2 polypeptide. One or more of the residues of this polypeptide can be altered, so long as antigenic function is retained. 
 Conservative amino acid substitutions are preferred--that is, for example, aspartic-glutamic as acidic amino acids; lysine/arginine/histidine as basic amino acids; leucine/isoleucine, methionine/valine, alanine/valine as hydrophobic amino acids; serine/glycine/alanine/threonine as hydrophilic amino acids. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 19 Acid addition salts of the polypeptides may be prepared by contacting the polypeptide with one or more equivalents of the desired inorganic or organic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid. Esters of carboxyl groups of the polypeptides may also be prepared by any of the usual methods known in the art. 
 Once isolated, hK2 polypeptide and its antigenically active variants, derivatives and fragments thereof can be used in assays for hK2 in samples derived from biological materials suspected of containing hK2 or anti-hK2 antibodies, as disclosed in detail in Serial No. 08/096,946. For example, the hK2 polypeptide can be labeled with a detectable label, such as via one or more radiolabeled peptidyl residues, and can be used to compete with endogenous hK2 for binding to anti-hK2 antibodies, as a "capture antigen" to bind to anti-hK2 antibodies in a sample of a physiological fluid, via various competitive immunoassay format for hK2 which uses anti-hK2 antibodies which are capable of immobilization is carried out by: providing an amount of anti-hK2 antibodies which are capable of attachment to a solid surface; mixing a sample of physiological fluid, which comprises hK2, with a known amount of hK2 polypeptide which comprises a detectable label, to produce a mixed sample; contacting said antibodies with said mixed sample for a sufficient time to allow immunological reactions to occur between said antibodies and said hK2 to form an antibody-hK2 complex, and between said antibodies and said labeled polypeptide to form an antibody-labeled polypeptide complex; separating the antibodies which are bound to hK2 and antibodies bound to the labeled polypeptide from the mixed sample; detecting or determining the presence or amount of labeled polypeptide either bound to the antibodies on the solid surface or remaining in the mixed sample; and determining from the result in step the presence or amount of said hK2 in said sample. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 In another format which can detect endogenous hK2 in a sample by a competitive inhibition immunoassay, a known amount of anti-hK2 antibody is added to a sample containing an unknown amount of endogenous hK2. The known amount is selected to be less than the amount required to complex all of the hK2 suspected to be present, that would be present in a sample of the same amount of physiological fluid obtained from a patient known to be prostate cancer. Next, a known amount of the hK2 polypeptide of the invention or a subunit thereof, comprising a detectable label is added. If endogenous hK2 is present in the sample, fewer antibodies will be available to bind the labeled hK2 polypeptide, and it will remain free in solution. If no endogenous hK2 is present, the added labeled polypeptide will complex with the added anti-hK2 antibodies to form binary complexes. Next, the binary antibody-antigen complexes are precipitated by an anti-mammal IgG antibody (sheep, goat, mouse, etc.). The amount of radioactivity or other label in the precipitate (a ternary complex) is inversely proportional to the amount of endogenous hK2 that is present in the sample, a pellet containing reduced amounts of radioactivity is indicative of the presence of endogenous hK2. 
 Alternatively to the conventional techniques for preparing polyclonal antibodies or antisera in laboratory and farm animals, monoclonal antibodies against hK2 polypeptide can be prepared using known hybridoma cell culture techniques. In general, this method involves prepared an antibody-producing fused cell line, of primary spleen cells fused with a compatible continuous line of myeloma cells, and growing the fused cells either in mass culture or in an animal species from which the myeloma cell line used was derived or is compatible. Such antibodies offer many advantages in comparison to those produced by inoculation of animals, as they are highly specific and sensitive and relatively "pure" immunochemically. Immunologically active fragments of the present antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention, the f(ab) fragment, as are partially humanized monoclonal antibodies. 
 The invention will be further described by reference to the following detailed examples. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 21 Example 1. 
 Materials and Methods Construction of mammalian hK2 expression vectors A cDNA (approximately 820 bp long) encoding the entire prepro-hK2 (pphK2) (from nucleotide #40 to #858 relative to the start site of the pphK2 transcript), as shown in Figure 2, was synthesized from RNA of human BPH tissue using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology with a pair of hK2 specific oligonucleotide primers 3 SEQ ID NO:8 and 5'ACAGCTGCAGTTTACTAGAGGTAGGGGTGGGAC 3' SEQ ID NO:9). 
 This cDNA was generated such that 5' and 3' ends (with respect to pphK2 sense sequence) were bracketed with BamH1 and Pstl sequences, respectively. The cDNA was then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and digested with BamHl and Pstl restriction enzymes. The restricted cDNA was ligated with BamH1-Pstl digested pVL1393 plasmid vector and transformed into the E. coli HB101 strain. E. coli harboring pphK2 cDNA/pVL1393 plasmid vector were selected. The pphK2 containing insert was sequenced. Plasmid pphK2 cDNA/pVL 1393 was mass-produced in E. coli and purified by CsCl gradient ultra-centrifugation. 
 Plasmid pphK2/pVL1393 in E. coli HB101 has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA on May 2, 1994 under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty and has been assigned accession number ATCC 69614. 
 A 0.8 kb fragment representing the entire pphK2 coding sequence (Figure 2) was generated by PCR using primers A 3 (SEQ ID NO:10) and B (5'ATATGGATCCTCAGGGGTTGGCTGCGATGGT3') (SEQ ID NO:11) and plasmid pVL1393 containing pphK2 (gift from Dr. Young, Mayo Clinic) as the template. PCR products were inserted into the TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) and the DNA of the entire insert was sequenced. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 22 To obtain the mammalian hK2 expression vectors, the hK2-containing inserts were isolated from the corresponding TA clones and inserted into the Bcl 1 site of the plasmid pGT-d (Berg et al., Nucl. Acids Res, 20, 54-85 (1992)) (gift from Dr. Brian Grinnell, Lilly) under the control of the GBMT promoter. 
 The mammalian expression vectors, PLNS-hK2 and PLNC-hK2 were obtained by cloning the 0.8 kb wild type hK2 insert from the corresponding TA vector into the plasmids, pLNSX and pLNCX (Miller et al., Biotech, 9, 980 (1989)), respectively. The orientation of the insert in all the mammalian expression vectors was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 
 Generation of recombinant clones AV12-664 (ATCC CRL-9595), a cell line derived from adenovirusinduced tumors in Syrian hamster, and DU145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (D1OF). PC3 cells were cultured in Minimal Eagle Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. AV12 cells were transfected with the hK2 expression vectors using the calcium phosphate method (Maniatis et al., supra (1989)). 
 Three days after transfection cells were resuspended in D OF 200 nM methotrexate (MTX). Drug-resistant clonal cell lines were isolated after 2-3 weeks and their spent medium was analyzed by Western blots. PC3 and DU145 cells were transfected with hK2 mammalian expression vectors using lipofectamine (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and clones (PC3-hK2 and SDU145-hK2) were selected in media containing 400 gpg/ml G418. 
 Purification and sequencing of the protein AV 2-hK2 clones were grown in D1OF 200 nM MTX. At about confluency the cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and resuspended in serum-free HH4 medium. The spent medium was collected 7 days after the addition of serum-free spent medium and stored at -20 0 C. To purify the protein, the serum-free spent medium was concentrated and exchanged into 50 mM sodium bicarbonate pH 8. Samples were filtered with 0.2 p filters and then pumped directly onto a TSK DEAE-5PW HPLC column, 21 mm X 150 mm, at a flow rate of 5 ml/minute. Buffer A contained 50 mM Na WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 23 bicarbonate pH 7.9 and Buffer B contained 50 mM Na bicarbonate plus 0.5 M NaCI pH 7.6. The elution profile was developed with a gradient from 0-50% Buffer B over 35 minutes; 50-100% B from 35-40 minutes and isocratic elution at 100% B for 5 minutes before re-equilibration in Buffer A. The flow rate was 5 mL/minute throughout. In the above procedure, borate buffer could replace bicarbonate buffer with no noticeable difference. 
 DEAE fractions were assayed for the presence of hK2 by the dried-down ELISA method (see below) using rabbit anti-pphK2 (Saedi et al., Mol. Cell. 
 Endoc., 109, 237 (1995)). Fractions with hK2 activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with membranes (10 kD cut off) to approximately 5-8 mL. Solid ammonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 1.2 M. This sample was then injected onto a PolyLC, polypropyl aspartamide column, 1000A pore size, 4.6 mm X 200 mm, to resolve proteins by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Buffer A was 20 mM Na phosphate, 1.2 M Na sulfate pH 6.3 and Buffer B was 50 mM Na phosphate, 5% 2 -propanol, pH 7.4. The elution gradient was 0-20% B over 5 minutes; 20-55% B from 5-20 minutes, isocratic at 55% B from 20-23 minutes, 55-100% B from 23-25 minutes; isocratic at 100% B for 2 minutes before re-equilibration Buffer A. The flow rate was 1 mL/minute. The HIC peak containing hK2 which eluted at about 50% B was exchanged into 50 mM borate buffer pH 8 by repeated concentration with Centricon-10 (Amicon) 10 K MW cutoff ultrafiltration. Purity was assessed by both SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. The extinction coefficient used to estimate hK2v 2 7 concentrations was A 28 0 of 1.84 1 mg/ml. 
 In some cases the HIC peak containing hK2 was purified further by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a 10/30 Pharmacia S12 column. In this case the HIC peak containing hK2 was concentrated by ultrafiltration as above to less than 1 mL and then applied to the size exclusion column equilibrated in 100 mM ammonium acetate pH 7 or sodium borate pH 8. The flow rate was 0.7 mL/minute. The hK2 peak was then concentrated by ultrafiltration. The peak collected off SEC in ammonium acetate was lyophilized to remove the buffer and then was reconstituted in water. An aliquot of this sample was WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 24 hydrolyzed in gaseous 6 N HCI under vacuum for 20 hours at 112 0 C then reconstituted in 0.1 N HCI and analyzed on a Hewlett Packard Aminoquant amino acid analyzer utilizing pre-column derivatization of amino acids with OPA for primary and FMOC for secondary amines. 
 A HK1G 586.1 affinity resin was used to purify hK2 by affinity chromatography. HK1G 586.1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was coupled with Pharmacia GammaBind plus Sepharose (cat. no. 17-0886) according to Schneider (JBiol. Chem., 257, 10766 (1982)). Briefly, HKIG 586.1 mAb and resin were incubated overnight at 4 0 C with rotation. Resin was centrifuged (500 X g for 5 minutes at 4°C) and washed twice with 0.2 M triethanolamine, pH 8.2. 
 Amine groups were cross-linked in fresh cross linker solution (25 mM dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride in 0.2 M triethanolamine, pH 8.2) for 45 minutes at room temperature The resin was quenched with 20 mM ethanolamine, pH 8.2, for 5 minutes at room temperature and then washed twice with 1 M NaCI, 0.1 M PO 4 pH 7.0. The resin was washed two more times with PBS and stored at 4 0 C with 0.05% NaN3 until use. 
 An Applied Biosystems Model 4 77a pulsed liquid phase sequencer was used to sequence the proteins and the peptides. The Model 477a employs automated Edman degradation chemistry to sequentially release amino acids from the N-terminus followed by PTH derivatization and chromatography by reversed-phase HPLC. The peptide samples were applied to the sequencer on biobrene-treated glass fiber filter supports and whole proteins were applied either to biobrene-treated filters or to pre-activated Porton filters (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Samples sequenced off blots were first run as mini-gels on the Novex system (Novex, San Diego, CA) then transferred to Problot PVDF membrane, visualized with Commassie blue, the appropriate band cut out and sequenced directly from the PVDF membrane. 
 Monoclonal antibody production A/J mice were injected with 50 l1 of phK2 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) i.p. on day 1, 25 pg of phK2 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) i.p. on day 14 and 25 pg phK2 in PBS i.p. on day 28. Three days prior to WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 fusion, mice were boosted with 10 gg ofphK2 in PBS i.v. Mice were sacrificed and a single cell suspension was prepared from the spleens. Immune B cells were fused with P3.653 myeloma cells using techniques well known to the art. 
 Clones were screened by ELISA and selected based on the reactivity of supernatants to hk2v 2 1 7 and phK2v 217 and minimal reactivity with PSA. Two clones selected by these criteria, clones HK1G464 and HKIG586, were subcloned using FACStar plus cell sorter to deposit single cells onto mouse spleen feeder layers. Subclones HK1G464.3 and HK1G586.1 were used for further studies. 
 Another fusion, which employed the same protocol described above except that the immunogen was hK2v 217 alum was used instead of CFA and IFA, BALB/c mice were used instead of A/J mice, produced clone HK1H247. 
 ELISA assays A dried-down ELISA format was used to measure hK2 in the serum-free spent medium of the clones and in the fractions collected during hK2 purification. Microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, NJ) were coated with 50 p1 of spent media or column fractions overnight at 37 0 C. The wells were washed with PBS 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated for one hour with 50 pl of primary antibodies. The wells were washed again with PBS+T and incubated for one hour at 37 0 C with 50 pl of goat anti mouse-IgG or goat anti rabbit-IgG Fc antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase (1:500, Jackson Immunosearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The wells were washed with PBST, incubated with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Sigma, MO) for 5 minutes, and the colorimetric reaction was measured at A 4 9 0 with an ELISA reader (Biotek Instruments, Inc., model EL310, VT). All samples were assayed in duplicate. The serum-free spent medium from AV 12 cells transfected with vector alone was used as negative control. 
 Antibodies were tested in a solution-based ELISA format using biotinylated phK2 7 hK2v217, and PSA. PSA was purified by the method of Sensabaugh and Blake Urolog. 144, 1523 (1990)). Twenty ng of biotinylated hK2v21 7 or phK2v 2 17 diluted in 50 pl Buffer A (8.82 mM citric acid, WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 26 82.1 mM sodium phosphate (dibasic), 10% BSA, 0.1% mannitol, 0.1% Nonidet pH 7.0) or 0.25 ng biotinylated PSA diluted in 10% horse serum (HS) in PBS was incubated with 50 pl of hybridoma supernatants, negative control supernatants irrelevant hybridoma supernatant for phK2' 17 and hK2 v217 or 20 pg/ml irrelevant purified mAb in HS for PSA), or positive control supernatants 20 ug/ml purified PSM773 (anti-PSA) mAb in HS for PSA, or HKID 104 (anti "hK2") hybridoma supernatant for phK2v 2 1 7 and hK2v 21 7 HCO514, a mAb against hCG, was used as a negative control in PSA assays, and ZTG085, a mAb against the tau, was used as a negative control in hK2 assays. 
 These mixtures of antibodies and antigens were allowed to incubate for 1 hour with shaking in a streptavidin coated microtiter plate (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The plate was washed 3 times with 300 pl of PBS, 0.1% (PBST), and incubated with 100 tl of gamma-specific goat anti mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Westgrove, PA), diluted 1:10,000 in HS, with shaking for 1 hour. After a second PBST washing, color was developed for 30 minutes, with shaking, following the addition of 100 vl of I mg/ml o-phenylenediamine in mM phosphate-citrate buffer, 0.03% sodium perborate, pH 5.0 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 pl 4 N H 2 
 SO 
 4 The color intensity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm and 540 nm using a microtiter plate reader. Absorbances above 2.6 at 490 nm were corrected with 540 nm reading. Sample values are averages standard deviation of triplicates. Control values are averages of duplicates. 
 Western blot assays Western blot analyses were performed using standard procedures. 
 Serum-free spent media were concentrated ten fold using Centricon 10 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and subjected to SDS/PAGE using a 12% gel (Bio-Rad, Inc., Melville, NY). For analytical purposes, SDS/PAGE was performed on a Pharmacia PhastSystem using 8-25% gradient gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked overnight at 4°C with 2% nonfat dried milk in PBS. Blots were rinsed then incubated with WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 27 primary antibody (1:1000 dilution of ascites, or 1 9g/ml of purified mAbs or polyclonal Abs) for 1 hour at 22 0 C. Blots were then washed and incubated for minutes with secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse-HRP or goat anti-rabbit- HRP, 1:500, Jackson Immunosearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The immunoreactive bands were detected by developing the blot using DAB (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) plus H 2 0 2 or by using the ECL (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) system according to manufacturer's instructions. 
 Covalent complex formation To test for covalent complex formation, 0.175 pM hK2 was incubated with 20 pM of inhibitor at pH 8 in 100 mM borate buffer. Inhibitors tested were 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), 1-antitrypsin, 1-antiplasmin, antithrombin and 2macroglobulin To 5 pl of hK2 (10 pg/ml) was added the calculated [Ig of inhibitor prepared in 100 mM borate buffer and, if needed, each sample brought up to a total volume of 10 il. Samples were incubated for 3 hours at 37 0 
 C 
 whereupon 1.5 pl of 7 X PhastSystem SDS sample buffer containing 35% 2mercaptoethanol was added and the sample boiled for 3 minutes in a water bath. 
 Samples were diluted 1/4 in SDS sample buffer prior to application to SDS/PAGE and Western analyses. 
 Proteolysis of Peptide Substrates To determine the ability of hK2 to cleave peptide substrates, peptides were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/ml then diluted 1:10 into 100 mM borate buffer pH 8 containing PSA, hK2 or trypsin. Typical experiments were performed as follows: 1 Il of peptide was added to 7 Rl of 100 mM borate buffer and then 2 pl of hK2 (10 tg/ml), PSA (500 pg/ml) or trypsin (0.5 Pg/ml) were added. In general, samples were incubated for 16 hours at 37 0 C. Samples were quenched with 100 il of 0.2% TFA/water and the quenched sample was applied directly to a Vydac C-18 reversed-phase column attached to a BioRad Model 800 HPLC equipped with an AS100 autosampler, dual 1350 pumps and Biodimension scanning UV-VIS detector. Solvent A was 0.1% TFA/water and Solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA. The sample was applied in solvent A and the gradient developed to 60% solvent B in 10 minutes. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 28 Absorbance was monitored simultaneously at 220 nm and 280 nm. Peaks collected off HPLC were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation or lyophilization and then applied to the amino acid sequencer to identify individual fragments. In some cases 10 tl of the quenched sample mixture was applied directly to the sequencing membrane and, since the sequence was known, the cleavage sites were determined from the distribution of amino acids present in each cycle. 
 Protease assays using chromogenic substrates Assays to measure the hydrolysis of para-nitroanilide derivatized substrates were performed using an HP 8452A UV-VIS spectrophotometer equipped with a programmable, thermostated 7-position cell holder. Assays were performed in 100 mM sodium borate pH 8 incubated at 37°C, the absorbance increase monitored at 405 nm. Methoxysuccinyl-Arg-Pro-Tyr-paranitroanilide (MeO-Suc-R-P-Y-pNA) and H-D-pro-phe-arg-para-nitroanilide  
 (P- 
 F-R-pNA) were 1 mM in the assay. 
 An ABI model 431A peptide synthesizer using standard FastMoc chemistry was employed to synthesize all of the peptides listed in Figure 16 except angiotensinogen and oxidized beta-chain of insulin which were obtained from Sigma. The mass of each synthesized peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry (University of Michigan, Core Facility) using ES/MS. An ABI Model 477a sequencer described above was employed to confirm peptide sequence. 
 Conversion of phK2v 21 7 to hK2V 2 1 7 Samples of phK2v 2 17 at 100-400 gg/ml in 50 mM sodium borate were incubated with 1% w/w trypsin or hK2 at 37°C. The conversion of pro to mature was monitored by dilution of 1-2 tg ofhK2v 2 7 starting material into 100 Pl HIC Buffer A and resolution of the two forms by HIC-HPLC as described above. 
 The incubation of hK2v 2 17 with phK2v 21 7 was conducted in the same manner except that comparable amounts of the two forms were incubated together as seen in Figure 17B.

 Expression and purification of hK 2 2 in mammalian cells To express hK2 in mammalian cell lines, a 0.8 kb fragment encoding the entire coding sequence of hK2 (pphK2) (Figure 2) was amplified using PCR, subcloned into the vector PCR II (TA) and several clones were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of the entire pphK2 insert in a few of these clones was determined to detect any mutations that may have been caused by PCR amplification. Two clones, one having a wild type hK2 insert, TA-hK2, and one having a mutant hK2 insert, TA-hK2v 21 7 were selected for further analysis.  
 TA- 
 hK2' 2 7 (SEQ ID NO:14) contains a substitution of T for C at codon 650 of hK2 resulting in a conservative substitution of valine (GTT) for alanine (GCT) at amino acid residue 217 of hK2 (Figure To obtain mammalian expression vectors, pphK2 inserts of TA-hK2 and TA-hK2v 21 7 were subcloned into plasmid PGT-d under the control of the GBMT promoter resulting in plasmids pGThK2 and pGThK2 21 7 (Figure The GBMT promoter is composed of several regulatory sequences and is activated by the adenovirus El a protein(s) (Berg et al., supra (1992)). 
 To determine whether the product of the pphK2v 2 1 7 gene would be expressed in mammalian cells, the plasmid pGThK2v 217 was transfected into AV12-664 cells. This cell line is derived from a tumor induced in Syrian hamster by adenovirus type 12 and expresses the adenovirus Ela protein. The Ela protein activates the GBMT promoter which results in the expression of the gene product under the control of this promoter. After 2-3 weeks, MTX-resistant clonal cells were isolated and their spent medium were analyzed by Western blots. Several clones were identified which secreted into the media a polypeptide immunoreactive to anti-pphK2 antiserum. One clone (AV12-pGThK2v 2 7 #2) was selected for further characterization and protein purification. 
 To purify hK2 polypeptides, the serum-free spent medium from AV12pGThK2 v21 7 clone #2 was collected after 7 days, concentrated and subjected to anion exchange chromatography (Figure 4A). The peak of hK2 activity eluted at approximately 0.2 M NaCI as determined by ELISA assays (dotted line). The WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 ELISA assay correlated well with the appearance of a -34 kD band of protein seen by SDS/PAGE in the same fractions. The hK2-positive fractions from the anion exchange column were collected and subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) (Figure 4B). A major portion of the A 28 0 was not retained on HIC column. The main peak retained on HIC, which eluted at 22 minutes, also showed the highest peak of activity by ELISA assay (dotted line, Figure 4C). A major protein band at -34 kD was also observed by SDS-PAGE. When the 22 minute peak from HIC was resolved by SEC, typically about 80-90% of the protein A 280 eluted at 19.4 minutes, a retention time consistent with a protein of approximately 34 kD (Figure 4C). The only other protein peak on SEC, eluting at 16.7 minutes, corresponded to a -70 kD protein observed in previous purification steps. 
 To further identify the purified protein, approximately 2.5 ag of the protein was subjected to automated N-terminal analysis which yielded the following sequence: Val-Pro-Leu-Ileu-Gln-Ser-Arg-Ileu-Val-Gly-Gly-Trp-Glu- (SEQ ID NO: 15). No competing sequence was evident from the profile of amino acids released sequentially by the Edman degradation procedure. By analogy to PSA this protein is phK2v 21 7 since the known sequence of mature PSA (isolated from seminal fluid) begins with Ileu-Val-Gly- and pPSA and phK2 have been postulated to have an extra 7 amino acids at the N-terminus (Figure Amino acid analysis of this protein yielded an amino acid composition consistent with the predicted sequence of phK2v 2 7 This phK2 polypeptide was purified in mg quantities. 
 Example 3. 
 Characterization of phK2 2 7 and generation of hK2v 2 7 To examine the efficiency of the purification scheme employed in Example 2, 1.5 lg of purified phK2v 2 17 was subjected to SDS/PAGE in the presence or absence of beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), and the gel was stained with silver. Results showed that the phK2v 2 1 7 in the sample was about 95% pure (Figure It also showed that phK2 217 migrated at -30 kD in the absence of WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 31 BME, and at -34 kD in the presence of BME. This pattern is similar to that observed for the PSA purified from seminal fluid (Figure The amino acid sequence of hK2, deduced from the cDNA sequence, shows the presence of one potential N-linked glycosylation site at residue 78 (N- To determine if this site is glycosylated, phK2v 217 was subjected to SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, reacted with digoxigenin (DIG)coupled lectins followed by horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-DIG. 
 In Figure 6 (lane 2 ig of phK2 was stained with concanavalin A (Con A) suggesting the presence of two nonsubstituted or 2-O-substituted a-mannosyl residues in the protein. Lane 2 shows Con A staining of the positive control glycoprotein, ZCE025 mAB. Both the heavy chains (50 kD) and light chains kD) of this mAb are known to contain N-linked oligosaccharides with mannose cores. Lane 3 shows that a nonglycosylated protein (BSA) fails to react with the Con A lectin. phK2v 21 7 also reacted with RCA (Gal bl-4GlcNAc specificity) and AAA, linked fucose specificity). This pattern of lectin reactivity is consistent with the presence of complex N-linked oligosaccharides. 
 The oligosaccharides on phK2v 21 7 also contains sialic acid since both SNA (sialic acid linked a(2-6) to galactose) and MAA (sialic acid linked a(2-6) to galactose were reactive with phK2v 2 7 The sequence of the pro region of hK2 is VPLIQSR (SEQ ID NO: 12). 
 An enzymatic cleavage at the carboxy-terminal end of the arginine in this pro sequence would convert phK2 to hK2. A mild trypsin digestion was developed to hydrolyze the peptide bond of purified phK2' 21 7 at this position. phK2v 2 17 was incubated with 1% trypsin and the conversion was monitored by HIC-HPLC (Figure This procedure resulted in a complete conversion of phK2v 21 7 to hK2v 217 The peak designated hK2v21 7 was N-terminally sequenced and shown to begin with the sequence, IVGGWE, which is the N-terminus for the mature form of hK2. No sequence other than the above was detected demonstrating that this mild trypsin treatment does not result in any significant level of non-specific cleavage. SDS/PAGE of trypsin-treated samples showed a small but discernible WO 98/02748 PCTIUS97/12322 32 increase in mobility, generally consistent with a minor reduction in mass of 826 daltons, the mass of the pro peptide.

 Generation of hK2-specific Abs phK2Q 17 and hK2""i were used as immunogens to generate monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against hK2. Hybridomas were screened based on high reactivity with hK2v 2 I or phK2v 217 and minimal reactivity with PSA. 
 Representatives of mAbs obtained from the hybridomas are shown in Table 1. 
 Immunization with phK2 v 2 7 resulted in mAb HK1G5 86.1 and HK IG 464.3.' HK1IG5 86.1 was hK2-specific, since it recognized both phK2 v 2 17 and hK2v 2 
 I 
 7 but not PSA. On the other hand, HKI G464 was phK2-specific, since it only recognized phK2 v 217 and not hK2v' 17 or PSA.

This mAb was hK2-specific since it recognized only hK2v 217 but not phK2 v 21 7 or PSA. These results show that phK2 21 7 and hK2 2 17 are useful as immunogens in generating mAbs specific for different forms of hK2. 
 Western blot analysis was used to examine if HK1G586 recognizes hK2 in seminal fluid (Figure hK2-immunoreactive bands at -22 kD, -33 kD, and kD were recognized by this mAb. A similar hK2-immunoreactive pattern in seminal fluid was also recently reported by Deperthes et al., Biochem. Biophy. 
 Acta, 1245, 311 (1995). This result indicates that a mAb raised to hK2v 2 1 7 recognizes native hK2 in seminal fluid. All the antibodies raised to hK2v 2 7 or phK2v 2 1 7 also recognized the corresponding form of hK2 and phK2 indicating that hK2 and phK2 are immunologically similar to hK2 2 7 and phK2v 2 1 7 respectively (see below). 
 Example Expression of hK2 in mammalian cells To express wild type hK2 (hK2) in mammalian cells pGThk2 (Figure 3) was transfected into AV12 cells. Several clones expressing an hK2 polypeptide were identified by Western analysis using HK1D 106.4 (a hK2-specific mAb raised to a polypeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 17-71 of hK2). 
 Clone AV 12-hK2#27 (AV 12-hK2) was selected for further analysis based on its higher hK2 expression level. Cells transfected with vector alone (pGTD) showed no reactivity with HK1D 106.4. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 34 ELISA using HKID 106.4 mAb indicated the presence of-0.5-1 pg/ml of an hK2 polypeptide in the serum-free spent medium of AV12-hK2 at day 7. 
 The same method used in purification of phK2v 21 7 from AV12-hK2v 2 7 was used to purify hK2 polypeptides from the day 7 spent medium of AV12-hK2. This resulted in low yields of purified hK2 polypeptides which were highly unstable to the purification procedures and thus impractical for use as an immunogen. 
 hK2 polypeptides were partially purified using the above method, subjected to SDS/PAGE, electroblotted and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. This analysis indicated that the hK2 polypeptide in the spent medium of AV12-hK2 at day 7 has the sequence, IVGGWECEK (SEQ ID NO:17) at N-terminus. No competing sequence was evident from the profile of amino acids released sequentially by the Edman degradation procedure. By comparison to PSA, this sequence corresponds to mature hK2 (hK2). Amino acid analysis of this protein was also consistent with that of hK2. 
 This finding was intriguing since it showed that predominantly phK2'" was present in the serum-free spent medium of AV 12-hK2 v 2 1 7 at day 7, whereas predominantly hK2 was present in the serum-free spent medium of AV 2-hK2 at day 7. To examine the form of hK2 present in the serum-free medium of AV12hK2 at day 1 this material was partially purified by affinity purification using HK1G 586.1 mAbs. The -34 kD protein was transferred onto PVDF and was subjected to N-terminal analysis revealing a sequence, VPLIQSRIVGG. No competing sequence was evident from the profile of amino acids released sequentially by the Edman degradation procedure. Compared with PSA, this sequence corresponds to phK2. This suggests that the hK2 polypeptide is secreted as the pro form by both AV12-hK2 and AV12-hk2v 21 7 cells. However, while phK2v21 7 is stable and is not converted to hK2v 2 17 phK2 is unstable and is easily converted to hK2 extracellularly. 
 Example 6. 
 Biosynthesis of hK2 To further study the biosynthesis of hK2 in mammalian cells, a time course study was conducted where serum-free spent media from AV 12-hK2 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 clone #27 was collected each day for 8 consecutive days, concentrated and subjected to SDS/PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with either HKID 106.4 or HKlG 464.3 mAbs (Figure As also shown in Figure 9, HK1D 106.4 recognizes both phK2 and hK2 whereas HK 1G 464.3 recognizes only phK2 as its epitope lies in -7 to +7 region of hK2. Expression of hK2 polypeptides (-34 kD) peaked by day 3 and plateaued thereafter as detected by HKID 106.4 mAbs. Two other immunoreactive bands migrating at -70 kD and -90 kD were also detected from day 4 onwards. 
 On the other hand, when the same samples were blotted and probed with HKIG 464.3, a gradual reduction in the level of hK2 was detected by day 4. By day 8, very low levels of hK2 were found in the spent medium. This result shows that phK2 is being secreted into the media by AV12-hK2 cells and is gradually converted to hK2 extracellularly. Curiously, -70 kD and -90 kD bands were not observed with HK1 G 464.3 mAbs indicating that these bands are either homo-oligomers of hK2 or are hK2 covalently complexed with a yet unknown protein(s). Even though the identity of these bands is not known at this time, they serve as markers for the presence of hK2 in the spent media. In Figure 9, purified phK2v 21 7 and hK2v 2 17 proteins were used as controls. 
 To study the biosynthesis of hK2v 217 in AV12 cells a similar time course study was conducted on AV12-hK2' 21 7 clone As shown in Figure expression ofhK2v 21 7 polypeptides peaked by day 3 and did not vary much from day 4 onwards as detected by HK1D 106.4 mAbs. Similar results were obtained when the blot was probed with HK1G 464.3 mAbs (Figure 10). This indicated that AV12-pGThK2 2 17 clone #2 cells are expressing phK2v 2 17 from day 1 onwards and that for at least 8 days thereafter, this protein is not converted to the mature form. These results are in contrast with those of phK2, which is converted to hK2 if left in the media for 8 days, indicating that phK2v 2 1 7 is stable in media at 37 0 C for 8 days. 
 To study whether extracellular conversion of phK2 to hk2 correlates with the viability of AV12-hK2 clone #27 cells in culture, clone #27 cells were WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 36 counted using trypan blue exclusion. Expression of hK2 in the spent medium was measured by ELISA using both HKID 106.4 and HK1G 464.3 mAbs. As shown in Figure 11, the number of viable cells peaked at 38 million in culture by day 3 and gradually decreased thereafter. By day 8, the number of viable cells were reduced to less than 10 million. The expression of phK2 (measured by HK 1G 464.3) also peaked by day 3 and gradually declined thereafter. 
 On the other hand, expression of hK2 (measured by HK D 106.4) peaked by day 3 but plateaued thereafter. This result indicates that phK2 is secreted by AV12-hK2 cells and a fraction of it is gradually converted extracellularly to hK2 by day 4. Moreover, it shows that conversion of phK2 to hK2 clearly correlates with a decrease in cell viability, indicating that the extracellular proteases released by the dying cells may be one of the factor(s) responsible for this conversion. Expression of hK2 was highest at the point in which cells were most viable. A decrease in hK2 paralleled a decrease in cell viability, suggesting the hK2 is secreted by these cells, as opposed to being released following cell death and lysis. Also, a rise in hK2 corresponded to a drop in phK2, indicating that the pro form of hK2 was automatically converted to the mature form over time. 
 To examine the biosynthesis ofhK2 in prostate carcinoma cells hK2 was expressed in DU145 and PC3 cell lines. pphK2 was cloned into plasmids pLNCX and pLNSX (Miller and Rosman, BioTechniques, 2, 980 (1989)), under Sthe control of the CMV and SV40 promoters, respectively. The resulting plasmids, pLNC-hK2 and pLNS-hK2, respectively, were transfected into PC3 and DU145cells, respectively, and clones were selected in media containing G418. Clones expressing high levels of hK2 were selected (PC3-hK2 and DU 45-hK2) by ELISA and Western blots. 
 To assess the level of hK2 and phK2 in the media, serum-free medium of PC3-hK2 and DU145-hK2 cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using HKID 106.4 (hK2-specific) and HKlG 464.3 (phK2-specific) mAbs (Figure 12). Results showed that phK2 is present in the spent medium of both DU145-hK2 and PC3-hK2. This indicates that in prostate carcinoma cells hK2 is WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 37 secreted as phK2 and is converted to the mature form extracellularly. This finding confirms the results previously obtained with AV12 cells. 
 Predominantly phK2 was detected in the spent medium of PC3-hK2 cells even after 7 days, however, predominately hK2 was present in the serum-free medium of DU 45-hK2 starting from day 1. This is probably due to abundance of extracellular proteases in DU145 spent medium. 
 To examine whether the above results were limited to just one clone, 3 other independently isolated clones of AV 12-hK2 and 4 other independently isolated clones of AV12-hK2v 21 7 were tested for the expression of hK2 polypeptides. Serum-free spent medium of the clones were collected at day 7 and tested for the expression of hK2 by Western blots using HK D 106.4 (hK2specific) and HKIG 464 (phK2-specific) mAbs (Figures 13 and 14). In all of the AV12-hK2 clones, HK1D 106.4 mAb detected not only the major -34 KD band but also the -70 kD and the -90 kD bands that are indicative of the presence of hK2 (Figure 13). HK1G 464.3 detected very low levels of phK2 in all of the AV12-hK2 clones (Figure 14). This result indicates that predominantly hK2 is present in the spent medium of all the AV12-hK2 clones verifying the biosynthetic mechanism established for AV 12-hK2 #27 clone. The same analyses were used on AV 2-hK2' 21 7 clones (Figure 14). Results indicated that only phK2 v21 7 was present in the spent medium of these clones at day 7 verifying our findings with the AV12-hk2v 2 7 clone. 
 The above results collectively suggest that hK2 is expressed as the pro form in mammalian cells and is converted to mature form extracellularly by as yet unknown proteases. These results also suggest that phK2 is present in biological fluids and therefore can be a useful diagnostic marker for pCa and 
 BPH. 
 Example 7. 
 Enzymatic activity and specificity of hK2 and hK2 2 1 7 A small amount of hK2 was purified to sufficient purity to establish its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. The general activity of hK2 was measured by determining its amidolytic activity chromogenically on p- WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 38 nitroanilide derivatives of peptides (Table The p-nitroanilide released by proteolytic digestion of these substrates is measured at absorbance  
 A 
 40 The substrate methoxysuccinyl-Arg-Pro-Tyr-para-nitroanilide (MeO-Suc-R-P-YpNA) is used to measure chymotrypsin-like proteases which cleave at the phenylalanine. This substrate has been used previously to measure the activity of PSA (Christensson et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 194, 755 (1990)). The substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-para-nitroanalide (P-F-R-pNA) is specific for trypsin-like proteases which cleave at arginine hK2 was found to have overall activity more than 10 times higher than hK2v 2 17 on P-F-R-pNA and neither protein showed an ability to hydrolyze MeO- Suc-R-P-Y-pNA, the chymotrypsin substrate. Other comparable substrates containing trypsin-like sites for cleavage (lysine, arginine) were also tested and hK2 was found to hydrolyze the substrate P-F-R-pNA with the highest rate. 
 These findings indicate that hK2 has trypsin-like activity.

 The specificity ofhK2 and hK2v21 7 was examined in more detail by the use of peptide substrates together with N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis to determine which peptide bonds had been hydrolyzed. Figure 15 shows amidolytic activity on the polypeptide CALPEKPAVYTKVVHYRKWIKDTIAAN (SEQ ID NO:16), which has both potential trypsin and chymotrypsin cleavage sites. hK2 2 1 7 cleaved at both a WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 39 trypsin and chymotrypsin site with the trypsin-like cleavage at a 2:1 ratio over the chymotrypsin-like cleavage. As a control in these experiments phK2 2 1 7 was also incubated with this peptide and showed no amidolytic activity. 
 hK2 showed specificity different than hK2v 2 17 towards this peptide substrate. No chymotrypsin-like specificity was seen for hK2 on this substrate and its activity was exclusive for the trypsin-like site None of the other lysine (K) residues in this polypeptide were hydrolyzed indicating that the specificity of hK2 was exclusive for the arginine residue. 
 As a control trypsin was also studied on this substrate. Trypsin cleaved all lysine and arginine sites except the K-P bond which is known not to be a site suitable for trypsin cleavage. Trypsin cleaved the R-K site of the 210- 236 substrate (peptide Figure 16) at rates approximately 4X faster than hK2 and -4000X faster than hK2v 2 17 NO chymotrypsin-like bonds were cleaved by trypsin. PSA cleaved the Y-R bond primarily. A minor trypsin-like activity on the R-K bond was also seen for PSA (Figure 15). This was consistent with the minor trypsin-like activity previously seen for PSA on the chromogenic substrate (Table 2). 
 Several other peptide substrates were also incubated with hK2 and PSA (Figure 16). In all of the peptides tested, hK2 had specificity only for selected arginines, and PSA primarily for selected tyrosine phenylalanine and leucine residues. Only peptide #1 in Figure 16 was cleaved by hK2' 21 7 as detailed by the chromatograms in Figure Example 8. 
 Activation of phK2v 2 7 by hK2 The sequence of peptide #3 in Figure 16 corresponds to amino acid residue -7 to +7 of phK2. This region contains the pro peptide, VPLIQSR, which is found as an N-terminal leader peptide in phK2v 217 As mentioned above, hK2 was able to cleave this peptide releasing the propeptide region, but hK2v 2 17 was not. To delineate if hK2 can cleave this pro sequence on a native substrate, its ability to convert phK2v 2 17 to hK2v 217 was monitored. phK2 v217 was incubated with 1% hK2 and the conversion was monitored by the HIC-HPLC WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 method (Figure 17A). Results showed that hK2 was able to convert phK2v 21 7 to hK2v 2 
 I 
 7 albeit at a rate ~30X slower than trypsin. When phK2v 2 7 was incubated with 40% hK2" 2 17 no difference in the ratios of the two hK2 forms was detected even after 6 hours (Figure 17B). This corroborated previous observations with the peptide substrate and showed that, even on a native substrate only hK2, and not hK2v 2 7 cleaved the pro region of hK2. 
 These results collectively demonstrate the stability of phK2v 217 and hK2v 2 7 upon extended incubation. When compared with hK2v 2 17, hK2 was shown to have a higher proteolytic activity, higher degree of specificity and, in particular, to have a specificity for the pro form of hK2 as demonstrated by activity on the pro peptide in Figure 15 and by its activity toward phK2'" 7 as shown in Figure 17. 
 These results demonstrate a significant difference in enzymatic activity between hK2 and hK2v 217 and may help explain the low yields obtained following attempts to purify hK2 from the medium, compared to yields of phK2v 217 Highly purified preparations of hK2 may not be stable due to autolysis, as seen for other active proteases. These results further suggest that, in addition to immunological tests, tests to determine its enzymatic activity on hK2-specific substrates could be used to monitor the level of hK2 in bodily fluids. 
 Example 9. 
 Formation of inhibitor complexes with hK2 PSA has been shown to form complexes with a2 macroglobulin  
 (MG) 
 and the serine protease inhibitor, antichymotrypsin (ACT). To explore its complex formation, hK2 was incubated with a series of common proteases present in human plasma (ACT, a 2 -antiplasmin, antithrombin III, and alantitrypsin (Travis and Salvesen, Ann. Rev. B ochem., 2, 655 (1983)) and the mixtures were analyzed by Western blot (Figure 18). Any covalent complex of hK2 with these serpins should result in -80-100 kD band on SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 41 ACT and a2-antiplasmin significantly fornmed complexes with hK2 (Figure 18, lane 1 and Antithrombin III (lane 3) and al-antitrypsin (a protease inhibitor, lane 4) formed no detectable complex with hK2. MG, a major component of blood plasma, also rapidly complexed with hK2 (lane This complex corresponds to Mr of -200 kD and 120 kD, which were also formed when PSA was incubated with purified MG (Figure 18, lane 8, see below). It was particularly interesting that hK2 did not form complexes with alantitrypsin, even though this protein inhibits a wide range of trypsin-like proteases (Loebermann et al., J. Mol. Biol., 177, 531 (1984); Carrell and Travis, TIBS, 10, 20 (1985)). 
 It was not surprising that hK2 formed a complex with a2-antiplasmin since this protein has arginine residues in its inhibitor active site (Hunt and Dayhoff, Biochem. Biophv. Res. Comm., 5, 864 (1980); Chandra et al., Biochemistry, 22, 5055 (1983); Potempa, et al., Science, 241, 699 (1985); Shieh et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264, 13420 (1989); Mast et al., Biochemistry, 30, 1723 (1991)). It was not expected that hK2 would form a complex with ACT, since ACT has a leucine in its inhibitor active site. Clearly, the structural similarities between PSA and hK2 influence their complex formation with a common inhibitor even though their proteolytic specificity is entirely different as demonstrated in Figure 16 and Table 2. 
 When spiked into human female serum, hK2 rapidly formed a complex with MG as detected by Western blot (Figure 18). Lane 1 and lane 3 are hK2and serum-only controls, respectively. Lane 2 is hK2 incubated with ACT showing the 90 kD hK2-ACT complex and residual hK2. Lanes 4 and 5 are hK2 spiked into serum for 15 minutes and 1 hour, respectively. Lane 6 is hK2 incubated with purified MG for 4 hours. Lane 7 is PSA spiked into serum for minutes and Lane 8 is PSA incubated with purified MG for 4 hours. 
 These results show that MG forms the major complex when hK2 or PSA are spiked into human serum in in vitro experiments. Since a PSA complex with ACT is known to occur in the blood serum of patients with prostate disease, it is likely that hK2 present in serum also forms some level of a complex with ACT. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 42 Discussion The in vivo protein processing and secretion mechanisms for PSA or hK2 are not known. The results presented herein show that phK2 is secreted by AV12-hK2, DU145-hK2, and PC3-hK2 cells, indicating that hK2 is normally secreted as phK2 and the propeptide is cleaved extracellularly. This suggests that phK2 exists in biological fluids and thus could be a useful diagnostic marker for pCa or BPH. 
 Both the mutant form of hK2 (hK2v 2 17 and the wild type form of hK2 were purified from AV12 cells. hK2 was very unstable to the purification procedures employed which, as found with other proteases, may be due to its autocatalytic property, and makes it very difficult to purify hK2 or phK2 in quantities sufficient for use as immunogens and calibrators. In contrast, phK2v 1 7 is highly stable and is converted to hK2v 217 which was also stable, by trypsin digestion. Purified phK2v 2 1 7 and hK2v 2 17 provided immunogens to generate mAbs specific for hK2 and phK2. 
 Example Detection of hK2 Polypeptides in Prostate Cancer Cell Line Supernatant Although PSA is a widely used diagnostic marker for prostate cancer (PCa), the detection of PSA cannot distinguish between PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia. To determine whether phK2 could be detected in the supernatant of a prostate carcinoma cell line, supematants from LNCaP cells, which naturally secrete both hK2 and PSA, were incubated with hK2-specific antisera. 
 A sequential sandwich assay using streptavidin microtiter plates was employed to measure phK2. Pro hK2-specific mab HKIG464 was biotinylated and used as the capture reagent. MAb HK1H449, which detects both phK2 and hK2, was europium labeled and used as the detector reagent. Time resolved immunofluorescence was measured using a Delfia fluorometer. Assay calibration was achieved by diluting purified phK2v 2 7 to varying levels from 0 to 100 ng/mL (Figure 20). The assay was tested for cross reactivity to PSA using purified PSA from seminal fluid. PSA at 10 lig/mL yielded a cross reactivity of WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 43 In addition, an assay that detects both phK2 and hK2 was established in an analogous manner using biotinylated mab HK1G586 as the capture reagent. 
 PSA cross reactivity for this assay was 0.3%. 
 LNCaP cells were cultured to 80% confluence in RPMI 10% fetal calf serum. The growth media was aspirated, and the plates were washed with 1 X PBS. HH4 10 nM mibolerone was added, and the spent media was collected for 4 days. Viable cells were enumerated by trypan blue staining. The samples were concentrated 4 fold and assayed for PSA (Tandem®-R, Hybritech, Inc., San Diego, CA), phK2 (HK1G464 capture) and phK2 hK2 (HK1G586 capture). In addition, hK2 enzymatic activity was measured using a hK2specific chromogenic substrate (Figure 21). The assay results showed that both phK2 and hK2 were expressed by prostatic carcinoma cells. phK2 and hK2 levels reached a maximum by day 2 while PSA levels continued to increase. 
 hK2 enzymatic activity increased throughout the time course which suggests that phK2 is converted to hK2 over time. 
 Aliquots of LNCaP samples, which were normalized to HK1G586 hK2 immunoreactivity, as well as hK2, phK2, PSA, pphK2, and ppPSA samples as controls, were applied to a 4-20% Novex Tris/Gly SDS PAGE and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed using either HKI G464 (20 pg/mL) or HK1G586 (2 pg/mL) as a primary antibody. After a 2 hour incubation with primary antibody at room temperature, the blots were washed and then probed with a goat anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody. After a one hour incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature, the blots were washed prior to development with ECL. The results showed that neither HK1G464 nor HK1G586 recognized PSA or ppPSA (Figures 22 and 23, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Moreover, HK1G464 is phK2 specific since it recognized only phK2 (Figure 22, lane 2) and not hK2 (Figure 22, lane 1) whereas HK1G586 recognized both phK2 and hK2 (Figure 23, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). In addition, Figure 22 (lanes 6-9) showed that HK1G464 detects phK2 (33 kD band) in all LNCaP samples indicating that phK2 is secreted from WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 44 LNCaP cells. There was approximately 15 ng of HK1G586 immunoreactivity in each lane of lanes 6-9 in Figures 22 and 23. 
 These results indicate that in prostate carcinoma cells hK2 is secreted as phK2. The results also suggest that phK2 may exist in biological fluids and thus could be a useful diagnostic marker for PCa or BPH. 
 Example 11. 
 Detection of hK2 complexes in Prostate Cancer Patient Sera To determine whether hK2 polypeptides exist in biological fluids, ten serum samples from prostate carcinoma patients were evaluated by Western blot with the anti-hK2 mab, HK1G586.1. The PSA levels in each of the serum specimens was determined by immunoradiometric assay (Tandem-R  
 PSA, 
 Hybritech, San Diego, California). Each sera was enriched for hK2 by absorption and elution from an anti-hK2 (HK1G586.1) immunoaffinity column. 
 Enriched sera was prepared by incubating 200 tl of serum with 75 pl of AminoLink Gel (Pierce, Rockford, IL) which had previously been coupled with the anti-hK2 mab, HK1 G586.1 according to manufacturer's instructions. 
 Incubation was carried out for 4.5 hours at room temperature on a shaker. The beads were washed four times in 5 mis of phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The hK2 was eluted from the beads by incubation with a minimal volume of 2.0% SDS in 0.5 M Tris-HCI, pH Reduced and denatured proteins were electrophoresed on 4-20% Spolyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Successful transfer was checked by staining blots with Ponceau S protein stain. Blots were blocked in nonfat dry milk in PBS and then incubated with antibodies (10 gg/ml) at 4°C overnight. Following washes, secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution) were incubated with the blots for 1 hour, followed by washes with PBS. Antibody reactivity was detected by the addition of mg/ml diaminobenzidine, 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS or using the ECL system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Illinois). In experiments where ECL detection was used, blots were incubated with antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature and exposed to X-ray film, typically for 30 seconds. 
 WO 98/02748 PCT/US97/12322 The majority of the enriched serum samples (7/10) contained a 33 kD species as well as a 90 kD species following detection with the anti-hK2 mab, HK G586.1 (Figure 24, Lane The three seras which did not react with HK1G586.1 contained low levels of PSA (Table Pools of normal female sera and normal male sera were also negative on Western blots with HK1 G586.1. 
 This data suggests that the levels ofhK2 in sera appear to correlate with levels of 
 PSA. 
 Free and complexed hK2 were detected by Western blot analysis of prostate carcinoma serum with anti-hK2 mab, HK1G586.1. Prostate carcinoma patient sera was enriched for hK2 by absorption and elution from an anti-hK2 (HK1G586.1) immunoaffinity column. The eluted material was examined on Western blot with anti-hK2 mab, HK1G586.1 (Figure 25). In lane 1, HK1G586.1 reacted with free hK2 at approximately 33 kD. A higher molecular species at approximately 90 kD was also detected with HK1G586.1. This 90 kD species was also detected with the anti-ACT mab, AC1A086 (lane The detection of the same band in the immunopurified hK2 by the specific anti-hK2 mab as well as the anti-ACT mab identified this 90 kD species as hK2-ACT. 
 Probing of a similar blot with an anti-PCI (protein C inhibitor) polyclonal antibody did not produce any signal, indicating that an hK2-PCI complex could not be detected in an enriched preparation of prostate cancer serum. The band at kD consistently seen across the blot represents the detection of immunoglobulin which is released from the immunoaffinity resin during the elution process and then detected by the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse- HRP in the Western blot procedure. The large band at approximately 66 kD, which is only detected with the anti-ACT mab, represents free ACT. 
 Thus, hK2 polypeptides are present in biological fluids of prostate cancer patients. Therefore, the detection of these polypeptides could be a useful diagnostic marker for PCa or BPH.
