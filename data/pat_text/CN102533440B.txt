The sequence in test sequences identical encoding active site etc..Although homology is also considered as similitude (i.e. with similar
The amino acid residue of chemical property/function), but in the context of the present invention, preferably with the homogeneity express homology of sequence. 
 Tetraploid rice can be carried out with the naked eye, or more generally, be carried out by the sequence comparison program with being readily available.This
A little commercially available computer programs can calculate the % homologys between two or more sequences. 
 % homologys can be calculated in adjacent sequence, i.e., one sequence is alignd with another, and by a sequence
Each amino acid directly compares with corresponding amino acid in another sequence, per next residue.This is referred to as " gapless
(ungapped) " compare.Generally, this gapless is compared only is carried out when number of residues is relatively fewer. 
 Although this is a kind of very simple and stabilization method, do not account for for example in the otherwise same of sequence
In the matching of one property, an insertion and missing will cause amino acid residue below to align, therefore when carrying out overall compare,
It is likely to cause % homologys significantly to decline.Therefore, the maximal sequence comparative approach designed to produce optimal arrangement is examined
Possible insertion and missing are considered, without the overall homology score of undue reduction (penalising).This is by sequence
" breach " is inserted in comparison, makes local homology maximize to realize. 
 But, " Gap Penalty " (" gap penalties ") is assigned each and compared by these increasingly complex methods
The breach of middle appearance so that for equal number of same acidic amino acid, the sequence alignment with breach number as few as possible is (anti-
Two are reflected by correlation higher between comparative sequences) than there is the ratio of many breach to available higher fraction.Generally make
With " affine breach cost " (" Affine gap costs "), the presence of breach undertakes of a relatively high cost, and in breach
Each follow-up residue point penalty it is less.This is most generally used breach points-scoring system.High Gap Penalty is produced certainly to be had
The optimization of less breach is compared.Most of alignment programs allow to be modified Gap Penalty.However, being carried out using these softwares
Default value is preferably used when sequence compares.For example, when using GCG Wisconsin Bestfit program bags, default amino
Acid sequence Gap Penalty is each breach -12 and each extension -4. 
 Therefore maximum homology percentage is calculated firstly the need of in view of Gap Penalty, produces optimal arrangement.Carry out described
The suitable computer program compared is the GCG Wisconsin Bestfit program bags (Nuc.Acids of Devereux etc. 1984
Research 12 p387).The example of other softwares of alignment can be carried out, is included but are not limited to, blast program bag

1999 177(1)：187-8 and tatiana@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). 
 Although final % homologys can be determined with homogeneity, comparison method is not usually to be had or entirely based on complete in itself
Paired comparisons without (all-or-nothing).Alternatively, proportional similarity scores matrix is commonly used, the square
Battle array is to assign fraction based on chemical similarity and each paired comparisons of evolutionary distance.The reality of commonly used such a matrix
Example is exactly the default matrix of BLOSUM62 matrixes-blast program component.(the further details ginseng if it can provide
See user's manual), GCG Wisconsin programs are usually using disclosed default value or the mark comparison sheet using customization.One
In a little applications, the disclosed default value of GCG program bags is preferably used, or in the case of other softwares, use default square
Battle array, such as BLOSUM62.

 HPTLC results show that the acyltransferase (0.4% corresponding to 0.08PLU-7/g oil) of lowest dose level is enough
The phosphatidyl choline in soya-bean oil is removed after the 20h reaction time.It was additionally observed that the water (5%) of maximum dose level seems to turn lipid acyl
The phosphatidyl choline moved in enzyme hydrolysis oil has adverse effect.It is anticipated that acyltransferase converts dosage highest sample
In hydrolysis degree it is lower, the fact that this into sample by also adding more water is explained.In contrast, it was observed that
Lecitase Ultra TM With lower hydrolysis of phosphatidlycholine degree in the water (1%) of lowest dose level, and Lecitase
Ultra TM It almost completely removes the phosphatidyl choline in the sample containing 5% water. 
 Fig. 7 result also shows that the major part of phytosterol in the sample handled with acyltransferase is converted into
Phytosterol ester, and use Lecitase Ultra TM Sterol ester is not formed then in the sample of processing.Fig. 7 shows Lecitase
Ultra TM More free fatties (FFA) are generated than acyltransferase. 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 Containing phosphatidyl choline, the lipid acyl of the model soya-bean oil degumming experiment display portion purifying of phytosterol and tocopherol
Based transferase can remove whole phosphatidyl cholines and with the formation of phytosterol ester, and only form a small amount of free fat
Fat acid. 
 Another advantage of the acyltransferase is to generate sterol ester, particularly Renascin, because sterol ester (bag
Include Renascin) beneficial health characteristic can be provided.In conventional edible oils processing, the polar lipid containing hydrolysis after degumming
The aqueous phase of (such as phosphatide and/or glycolipid) is separated with oil.Generally in oil refining process from edible oil remove sterol (this is sometimes referred to
For deodorization (deodorising)).However, sterol ester (and Renascin) anti-deodorization, is thus remained in oil.Sterol ester is in oil
In accumulation be attractive because have shown that the mankind it is more intake phytosterol esters can reduce the wind for suffering from angiocardiopathy
Danger. 
 Experiment also shows that acyltransferase can generate Renascin, and it can also be accumulated in oil. 
 This to improve oil oxidation stability it is helpful, thus as using acyltransferase of the present invention progress degumming
Another advantage.

6 and 7) in do not stay any lysolecithin.Lecitase Ultra TM Also phosphatide (PC) is removed, but some bands remain in layer
In analysis spectrum, it should be lysolecithin.It was additionally observed that lipid acyltransferase can work in the environment of very low water content,
But Lecitase Ultra TM Needing 1 to 5% water can just work. 
 Figure 27 result confirms that free sterol is changed into sterol ester by acyltransferase, and Lecitase Ultra TM 
Sterol is not acted on.Figure 27 also shows in acyltransferase and Lecitase Ultra TM Sample in all form one
A little free fatties.The reason for acyltransferase formation free fatty, can be illustrated by the fact：Without foot
Enough acyl-donors (sterol) can be obtained, therefore also occur that some hydrolysis. 
 Sample 1,2,3,6,8 and 10 from table 4 is analyzed by GLC and the amount of sterol and sterol ester is determined.As a result such as
Shown in table 5. 
 The GLC analyses of the sterol of table 5. and sterol ester
