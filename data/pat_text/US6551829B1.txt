 1. Technical Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to extremely excellent, drying-resistant practical baker's yeast. Some types of drying-resistant baker's yeast have heretofore been produced. For their forms as commercial products, they are of so-called dry yeast, and are suitable to long-term storage. However, only two types of dry yeast are commercially available, of which (1) one is for baked goods having a relatively low sugar concentration (for example, French bread, etc.), and (2) the other is for high-sugar dough (for example, for sweetened buns, etc.) having a relatively high sugar concentration. Baked goods as produced with the dry yeast of those types are not characterized by their tastes. For its use in dough, the conventional dry yeast is selected merely depending on the sugar concentration in dough as roughly classified into two, high-sugar dough and low-sugar dough, since its ability to expand the dough is relatively high in the selected condition. The yeast of the invention is characterized not only by its strong power to ferment dough having specific sugar concentrations but also by its ability to give baked goods having characteristic and delicious tastes. Specifically, the yeast of the invention has good drying resistance while retaining the properties of practical baker's yeast. According to the invention, therefore, there are provided many dry yeast products which are useful in backing having good storability To that effect, the drying-resistant practical baker's yeast of the invention is extremely excellent. 
 Specifically, according to the invention in which is employed a novel constitution of merely inactivating only either one of the ATH1 gene or the NTH1 gene in practical baker's yeast having various excellent characteristics but not having resistance to drying, it has become possible to make the practical baker's yeast have drying resistance that is comparable to or higher than that of ordinary commercially-available baker's yeast for dry yeast. Therefore, the invention makes it possible to provide dry yeast having good storability and suitable to any baking methods for producing various types of baked goods, and the invention greatly contributes to developments in the baking industry. 
 2. Prior Art 
 For its commercial products, drying-resistant baker's yeast is produced in the form of so-called dry yeast. Commercial products of dry baker's yeast may be classified into two, depending on their production methods and properties. One is so-called active dry yeast that does not require any special apparatus for its production. This has a water content of around 10% and is generally granular, and its life for storage is relatively short. In its use, it is dissolved in warm water containing sugar, re-activated therein for ten minutes, and mixed with dough. The other is so-called instant dry yeast. This has a water content of around 4% and is storable for a long period of time (for example, for a few years in vacuum packages). In its use, it is once dissolved in warm water for re-hydration, and immediately mixed with dough without being intentionally re-activated, or it may be directly mixed with dough without being re-hydrated. 
 However, as so mentioned hereinabove, the conventional dry baker's yeast has a few variations. Given that situation, it is strongly desired in the art to develop excellent practical baker's yeast having good drying resistance and retaining the properties of ordinary baker's yeast (therein, the property of rapid expanding dough to give baked goods having good tastes and pleasant to the tongue). 
 The drying resistance as referred to herein is meant to indicate the characteristic especially indispensable to the strains to be used for producing the instant dry yeast of dry baker's yeast mentioned above. Specifically, the drying resistance is the ability of those strains to well grow in industrial cultivation conditions of fed-batch culture and to be well dried in particular industrial drying method of fluidized-bed drying to give dry yeast. In addition, the dry yeast must be well stored long, and immediately after re-hydrated with water, it must have the ability to well expand dough. 
 We, the present inventors have previously succeeded in obtaining frozen dough-resistant and high-sugar dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast by increasing its trehalose retentiveness, and have filed patent applications for it (see Japanese Patent Application No. 8-297886 for NTH1 (neutral trehalase gene) disruption; Japanese Patent Application No. 9-352016 for ATH1 (acidic trehalase gene) disruption; the report of Takano, et al. of National Food Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, red in the Meeting of the Japanese Society for Food Science and Technology in 1997). 
 On the other hand, it was believed that baker's yeast could have drying resistance only when its trehalose content could be increased. For this, John Kim, et al. (of the California University) suggested trehalase gene disruption in baker's yeast (see Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Vol. 62, No. 5, 1996). However, they used laboratory strains in their studies, and nothing is suggested for the usefulness of the ATH1 gene disruption in practical baker's yeast. In other words, their studies were not confirmed in the practical baking industry, and at present, the industrial usefulness of the ATH1 gene-disrupted strain is not confirmed at all. In fact, even if its trehalose content is increased, baker's yeast could not get drying resistance only through the increase. This is because dried cells (for dry yeast) require trehalose as the energy source of reactivation when they are re-hydrated with water. Therefore, the laboratory strains having been so genetically manipulated through NTH1 gene a disruption that their neutral trehalase activity is 0 (zero) could not get drying resistance. For the same reasons, it cannot be believed at all that the laboratory strains naturally having a lower degree of NTH1 activity than that of practical strains and having been genetically manipulated for ATH1 gene disruption could still retain the trehalase activity that is necessary for re-activation of the dried cells with water only by the action of the NTH1 gene therein. 
 Where the yeast of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is used as practical baker's yeast, its source shall be a species of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  and, in addition, the yeast must satisfy various requirements needed in its practical use. For example, the indispensable requirements for the yeast are as follows: 1. In order to cultivate it on an industrial scale, the yeast must grow well in blackstrap molasses media that are generally used for mass-cultivating baker's yeast (that is, the growth rate of the yeast is high, and the yield thereof is large), the baker's yeast having grown in the media must be efficiently separated therefrom, and the efficiency in the dehydrating step in the process of forming the thus-separated baker's yeast into commercial products must be high (in that step, used is a specific device of a so-called dehydrator). 2. The products could keep the yeast activity (dough-expanding activity) during long-term cold storage (generally, for a few weeks), they are hardly softened during the storage, they are white without adsorbing blackstrap molasses. Apart from those, the yeast is required to have capabilities compatible with various baking methods. 
 For the reasons noted above, there is almost no possibility that laboratory strains not subjected to the screening for practical baker's yeast could be directly used as those for practical baker's yeast. In general, the requirements noted above are rarely governed by one gene but are often defined by a plurality of genes. In addition, there are known few studies relating to the relationship between the properties of practical baker's yeast and the genes constituting the yeast. 
 Being different from laboratory strains, most strains for practical baker's yeast are polyploidal and hardly form spores. Therefore, even the application of the breeding method of mating/spore separation that is based on classic breeding systems and is generally applied to laboratory strains, to baker's yeast strains is extremely difficult. Good practical baker's yeast shall exclusively rely on the screening of spontaneous mutants from ordinary strains that have been practically used in the art for many years, or on the screening thereof from the natural world. Gunge, et al. first applied a classic breeding method to baker's yeast in their rare-mating method (see Genetics, Vol. 70, 1972), and after that, one example of practical application of the method was first described in the specification of a patent application filed in 1982 for “Saccharomyces species FD612” (see JP-B-1-16155). 
 Problems to be Solved by the Invention 
 As has been so mentioned hereinabove, dry baker's yeast has a few variations. This is because screening of strains for drying-resistant yeast requires much labor since it is not clarified as yet as to what factor in yeast cells governs the drying resistance of yeast. In fact, therefore, to obtain dry baker's yeast for practical use, yeast cells must be cultivated by fed-batch culture to make them have a suitable degree of fermenting power and a suitable trehalose content, and thereafter the thus-cultivated cells must be subjected to a dryability test using a fluidized-bed drying device comparable to an industrial one. Few attempts have heretofore been made in the art to breed strains for dry baker's yeast through mating. 
 Given that situation, we, the present inventors have specifically noted trehalose of various stress-related substances in yeast cells and have made various studies relating to the intracellular trehalose content of yeast cells. In particular, we attempted to increase the intracellular trehalose which acts as a protective substance when yeast cells are dried and which is to be the energy source when the dry baker's yeast of the dried cells is re-hydrated with water, and have completed the invention as a result of such our studies. 
 Means for Solving the Problems 
 Even though baker's yeast that is hardly killed by drying could be constructed through NIH1 or ATH1 gene disruption, drying-resistant practical baker's yeast capable of producing delicious bread could not be obtained as yet. We, the present inventors desired to modify practical baker's yeast having excellent properties but not having resistance to drying into drying-resistant practical baker's yeast still having its original excellent properties and additionally having drying resistance that is comparable to or higher than that of ordinary, commercially-available drying-resistant yeast. For this purpose, we analyzed in detail starting yeast strains, dry yeast from the strains and even final bread as produced by the use of the dry yeast in various experiments and, as a result, have completed the invention. 
 The invention relates to a set of NTH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts as produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the NTH1 gene in a set of haploid yeasts of which the original hybridized diploid is practical baker's yeast. 
 The invention also relates to a diploid or higher polyploid, drying-resistant, practical baker's yeast as produced through mating with one or more NTH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the NTH1 gene in a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast. 
 The invention further relates to a set of ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts as produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in a set of haploid yeasts of which the original hybridized diploid is practical baker's yeast. 
 The invention still further relates to a diploid or higher polyploid, drying-resistant, practical baker's yeast as produced through mating with one or more ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast.

 MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE  INVENTION   
 1. (Screening for Haploid Yeasts of Which the Diploids are Practical Baker's Yeasts, and Genetic Marking) 
 In the invention, the screening of yeast strains for those to be subjected to gene manipulation is indispensable. First are selected haploid yeast strains, which must be identified as to whether they are a-type ones or α-type ones. Where a selected haploid yeast could be conjugated with a previously prepared a-type haploid yeast within a few hours in the culture of the two in a ratio of 1/1 and where the conjugation could be confirmed with a microscope, the haploid yeast is identified as an a-type one. On the other hand, where the conjugation of a selected haploid yeast with a previously prepared a-type haploid yeast in the culture of the two in a ratio of 1/1 could be confirmed, the haploid yeast is identified as an α-type one. In laboratory experiments, the thus-identified haploid yeasts could be subjected to the next step of genetic marking. In constructing practical baker's yeasts, however, a step of screening the identified haploid yeasts is indispensable prior to the genetic marking step. The screening step may be effected in the manner mentioned below. 
 An a-type or α-type haploid yeast is mated with an α-type or a-type haploid to construct an a/α-type diploid yeast. Then, in the first stage, the resulting diploid strains are screened in a mass-cultivation test such as that mentioned hereinabove, which is based on the possibility of industrial production of the strains. Next, in the second stage, the strains thus cultivated and screened in the previous test are further screened for those that satisfy the requirements of commercial products also mentioned hereinabove. Finally, the strains thus passed the two-stage screening are cultivated, and the thus-cultivated strains are used in producing different types of bread. In this final step, the strains with which excellent bread samples were produced are selected. Thus, the yeasts used in preparing the excellent bread samples are known, and they are determined to be haploid yeasts to be subjected to gene manipulation. There are various types of bread, including, for example, loaves, rolls, croissants, French bread and rolls, and buns, for all of which diploid yeasts as constructed from various haploid yeasts are tested. Depending on the haploid yeast to be mated, the characteristics of the bread to be prepared by dough that comprises the mated diploid yeast greatly vary. Therefore, the screening for the suitable haploid yeast to be subjected to gene manipulation is extremely difficult. However, in order to obtain the intended, drying-resistant practical baker's yeast, this screening step is indispensable. 
 Gene manipulation of yeast requires genetic markers. Practical baker's yeast has no marker, and where it is subjected to gene manipulation, employable are markers except those for the genes of the yeast, such as chemical-resistant markers and the like, which, however, are unfavorable from the viewpoint of the safety in the gene manipulation. Haploid strains to be subjected to gene manipulation within the range of their self-cloning require genetic markers. In that case, if the yeast to be processed is mutated with chemicals or the like, it will lose its intrinsic favorable properties. For this, therefore, it is desirable to employ a screening method for spontaneous mutants. For example, as the marker genes, preferred are URA3, LYS2, ADE2 and the like for easy screening for the intended defective strains. 
 To introduce a gene marker, ura3 (URA3-defective strain) into a haploid strain, cells of the strain are screened in a 5-fluoro-orotic acid-containing medium. Briefly, cells of a haploid strain are cultivated in a YPD liquid medium, centrifuged, and washed with a 0.85% NaCl solution. About 10 8  cells thus cultivated are applied onto a 5-fluoro-orotic acid-containing medium (0.7% YEAST NITROGEN BASE (DIFCO), 2% glucose, 0.1% 5-fluoro-orotic acid, 0.05% uracil, 2% agar) and cultivated thereon at 30° C. for 3 days, and the cells growing on the medium to give colonies thereon are selected. The cells having grown on the medium do not have intact URA3 gene, as having been spontaneously mutated. Such URA3-defective cells are obtained at a frequency of one cell per 10 6  to 10 7  cells. 
 Those URA3-defective cells could not grow on an uracil-free medium, but could grow thereon only after having been transformed with an URA3-containing plasmid, such as YCp50 or the like. Therefore, through the transformation of those cells, the defect of URA3 therein can be confirmed. 
 2. (Formation of NTH1 Gene-disrupted Strain) 
 In the invention, where a marker gene, such as URA3 (uridylic acid synthetase) (Gene 29: 113-124, (1984)), ADE2, LYS2 or the like, is inserted into the NTH1 gene (neutral trehalase gene) (J.B.C. 268: 4766-4774 (1993)) of a haploid yeast, which is shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG.  3  and FIG. 4, the NTH1 gene is disrupted and could no more be expressed in the NTH1 gene. In the resulting yeast with the NTH1 gene disrupted, the URA3 or other auxotrophic marker gene as inserted into the yeast is expressed, whereby the disruption of the NTH1 gene in the yeast is confirmed. The URA3 and other marker genes to be inserted into the yeast are preferably those derived from  Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  especially those from baker's yeast, for realizing their self-cloning. 
 The object of the disruption of the NTH1 gene in haploid yeasts is to prevent the NTH1 gene from being expressed in the yeasts to give a neutral trehalase which decomposes trehalose. For this, therefore, all or a part of the gene sequence of the NTH1 gene is deleted. Preferably, in the invention, URA3 is inserted entirely or partly into the region of the NTH1 gene of a haploid yeast to thereby destruct the NTH1 gene therein. 
 First, a part of the gene sequence of the NTH1 gene shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG.  3  and FIG. 4 is inserted into an  E. coli  vector, such as pUC19, then the URA3 gene having a base sequence of  Sequence Number  4 in the Sequence Listing mentioned below is inserted into the partial region of the NTH1 gene in the vector. The resulting placid is proliferated in  E. coli  cells. From this plasmid, cleaved out is only the DNA fragment of NTH1 (former half)-URA3-NTH1 (latter half). The thus-isolated DNA fragment is thereafter transformed into a haploid yeast, of which the diploid is a practical baker's yeast, in a lithium acetate method. 
 The DNA fragment, NTH1 (former half)-URA1-NTH1 (latter half) in the haploid yeast is hybridized and recombined in such a manner that URA3 still remains in a part or entire region of the NTH1 gene sequence whereby the NTH1 gene is completely divided into two, its former half and latter half, via URA3 therebetween, to complete the gene disruption. 
 3. (Mating of NTH1 Gene-disrupted Haploid Yeast) 
 The NTH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeast obtained herein is either an a-type or α-type one, while having such necessary properties that its diploid yeast can be a practical baker's yeast. In other words, only the NTH1 gene is disrupted in the haploid yeast through the gene disruption, while the other genes in the resulting NTH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeast are intact and still maintain their intrinsic properties. 
 In the invention, one or more NTH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeasts as prepared through the process of disrupting the NTH1 gene of a haploid yeast, of which the diploid is a practical baker's yeast, are mated with any other haploid yeasts to give diploid or higher polyploid, drying-resistant practical baker's yeasts. 
 One preferred embodiment of the mating is to mate an a-type, NTH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeast is mated with an a type, NTH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeast to give a diploid yeast. 
 FIG. 5 shows an outline of the process of producing the diploid, drying-resistant practical baker's yeast of the invention. One of many diploid, drying-resistant practical baker's yeasts obtained herein, a baker's yeast of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  T154 (FERM BP-5678) was deposited in the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology of Japan. 
 The polyploid, drying-resistant practical baker's yeasts of the invention have excellent drying resistance. In particular, when they are cultivated on an industrial scale and are dried also on an industrial scale to give instant dry yeasts for bread production, the power of the resulting dry yeasts for dough fermentation is extremely great. 
 4. (Cloning of Acidic Trehalase Gene) 
 Cloning of acidic trehalase gene ATH1 may be attained for example, in an ordinary shot-gun cloning method based on the fact that ATH1 gene-defective strains could not grow in a medium comprising trehalose as only one carbon source. However, since the full-length base sequence of the chromosome of the yeast of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  was already known, the cloning of the gene of which the sequence was already known such as the acidic trehalase gene ATH1 is generally effected through PCR (polymerase chain reaction). For inactivating (disrupting) the gene, cloning of the full-length gene is unnecessary, and a partial region of the gene may be cloned. 
 5. (Construction of Vector for ATH1 Gene Disruption, and Disruption of ATH1 Gene) 
 The object of the disruption of the ATH1 gene in haploid yeasts is to prevent the AH1 gene from being expressed in the yeasts to give an acidic trehalase which decomposes trehalose. For this, therefore, all or a part of the gene sequence of the ATH1 gene is deleted. Preferably, in the invention, the ATH1 gene in a haploid yeast is completely replaced with URA3, or URA3 is inserted into the ATH1 gene thereby substantially inactivating the ATH1 gene for disrupting the gene in the yeast. 
 First, a part of the amino acid-coding region of the ATH1 gene of  Sequence Number  3 in the Sequence Listing is, after having been amplified through PCR, inserted into an  E. coli  vector, such as pGEM-T, then the full-length URA3 gene of  Sequence Number  4 is inserted into the partial region of the ATH1 gene in the vector. The resulting plasmid is proliferated in E. coli cells. From this plasmid, cleaved out is only the DNA fragment of ATH1 gene (former half)-URA3-ATH1 gene (latter half). With the thus-isolated DNA fragment, thereafter transformed is a haploid yeast, of which the diploid is a practical baker's yeast, by a lithium acetate method. The DNA fragment, ATH1 gene (former half)-URA3-ATH1 gene (latter half) in the haploid yeast is site-specifically recombined with the ATH1 gene in the yeast, whereby the ATH1 gene is completely divided into two, its former half and latter half, via URA1 therebetween, resulting in that the gene is completely disrupted and is substantially inactivated. 
 6. (Formation of Diploid) 
 The ATH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeast obtained herein is either an a-type or α-type one, while having such necessary properties that its diploid yeast can be a practical baker's yeast. In other words, only the ATH1 gene is disrupted in the haploid yeast through the gene disruption, while the other genes in the resulting ATH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeast are intact and still maintain their intrinsic properties. In the invention, one or more ATH1 gene-disrupted haploid yeasts as prepared through the process of disrupting the ATH1 gene of a haploid yeast, of which the diploid is a practical baker's yeast, are mated with any other haploid yeasts to give diploid or higher polyploid, drying-resistant practical baker's yeasts. 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 (Screening for Haploid Yeast of Which the Diploid is Practical Baker's Yeast) 
 25 stock cultures of wild haploid yeasts were identified as to whether they are a-type ones or α-type ones, and all of these were tested to know as to whether or not their diploids could be practical baker's yeasts. As a result of the test, 8 strains as in Table 15 were selected. 
 These 8 strains were subjected to NTH1 gene disruption according to the method mentioned below, by which the NTH1 gene existing therein was disrupted. Before and after the gene disruption, the neutral trehalase activity of each strain was measured. 
 The data obtained are shown in Table 15, from which it was confirmed that the neutral trehalase activity of the NTH1 gene-disrupted strains was significantly lowered. That is, the data indicate the disruption of the NTH1 gene in those strains.

 (NTH1 Gene to be Disrupted) 
 It is known that NTH1 gene is positioned just adjacent to the centromere in the fourth chromosome of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  of baker's yeast, and its gene sequence is as in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG.  3  and FIG.  4 . 
 In the invention, the NTH1 gene of baker's yeast was obtained from the region containing the centromere in the fourth chromosome of a usually-available yeast vector, YCp50 through gene eviction, and its sequence was confirmed as in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG.  3  and FIG.  4 . 
 (Construction of Vector for Disrupting NTH1 Gene) 
 pNTHd1: 
 From the NTH1 gene cloned, pNTHd1 was constructed as in FIG.  6 . 
 Precisely, the region of NTH1 gene between the KpnI-recognition site in the 3′-side and the EcoRI-recognition site in the upstream site above it, which was about 770 bp, was cleaved at the both recognition sites, as in FIG. 6, and the resulting fragment was inserted into a commercially-available  E. coli  vector, pUC19, at the same restriction enzyme-recognition sites (KpnI and EcoRI-recognition sites) to obtain pNTH-KE. The resulting plasmid was cleaved at the XhoI-recognition site, and its terminals were blunted with a DNA polymerase. On the other hand, the URA3 gene in commercially-available YEp24, which is as in FIG. 6, was cleaved with HindIII and recovered. This U fragment of about 1,170 bp was blunted with a DNA polymerase, and inserted into the plasmid pNTH-KE having been cleaved and blunted as above, through ligation with a ligase to obtain pNTHd1. 
 (Disruption of NTH1 Gene of Haploid Yeast) 
 Disruption of NTH1 Gene with pNTHd1: 
 pNTHd1 was cleaved with EcoRI and KpnI to isolate a DNA fragment of NTH1 (former half)-URA3-NTH1 (latter half), with which each haploid yeast of No. 2, No. 7, No. 12, No. 13, No. 14, No. 18, No. 19 and No. 21, all shown in Table 15, was transformed in a lithium acetate process. 
 The chromosomal DNA extracted from each of those transformant strains was digested with EcoRI, and 0.5 μg of the DNA fragment was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Southern hybridization, from which was confirmed the gene disruption as in FIG.  7 . In FIG. 7, the left side column indicates the position of the bands of the molecular weight markers (λDNA-HindIII digested). 
 Each lane corresponds to the strain number as follows:  Lane  1 is No. 2;  lane  2 is No. 2-d;  lane  3 is No. 7;  lane  4 is No. 7-d; lane 5 is No. 12;  lane  6 is No. 12-d;  lane  7 is No. 13;  lane  8 is No. 13-d; lane 9 is No. 14;  lane  10 is No. 14-d;  lane  11 is No. 18;  lane  12 is No. 18-d;  lane  13 is No. 19;  lane  14 is No. 19-d;  lane  15 is No. 21; and  lane  16 is No. 21-d. In those, “d” means that the strain was processed with pNTHd1 for gene disruption, and the same shall apply to the strains in other Tables. The data in FIG. 7 verify the disruption of the NTH1 gene in those strains. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 (Screening for Haploid Yeast of Which the Diploid is Practical Baker's Yeast) 
 25 stock cultures of wild haploid yeasts were identified as to whether they are a-type ones or α-type ones, and all of these were tested to know as to whether or not their diploids could be practical baker's yeasts. As a result of the test, 8 strains as in Table 16 were selected. These 8 strains were subjected to ATH1 gene disruption according to the method mentioned below, by which the ATH1 gene existing therein was disrupted. Before and after the gene disruption, the acidic trehalase activity of each strain was measured. 
 The data obtained are shown in Table 16, from which it was confirmed that the acidic trehalase activity of the ATH1 gene-disrupted strains was significantly lowered. That is, the data indicate the disruption of the ATH1 gene in those strains.

 (Cloning of ATH1 Gene) 
 A partial sequence of ATH1 gene was cloned, using a Promega's pGEM-T vector system. The outline of the cloning is shown in FIG.  8 . 
 Precisely, based on the known base sequence of ATH1 gene (see Yeast, Vol. 11, 1995), 20 bp primers of  Sequence Number  1 and  Sequence Number  2 were designed in an ordinary manner. A chromosomal DNA was extracted from the yeast of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  T019, and purified. Using this DNA as the template, along with the synthetic DNA primers of    Sequence Numbers    1 and 2 noted above, a partial sequence of 1,150 base pairs between the 481st base and the 1,630th base in the coding region for ATH1 gene was amplified through PCR. Next, the thus-amplified DNA fragment was purified in an ordinary manner, and ligated with a pGEM-T vector by the use of a T4 DNA ligase. Thus was obtained a plasmid pCI1. This plasmid pCI1 was introduced into cells of  E. coli  (transformation) in an ordinary manner, amplified, and purified. Next, the restriction enzyme HindIII-recognition site, which is only one in the ATH1 gene partial sequence in the purified plasmid, was cleaved with the enzyme HindIII. On the other hand, a known plasmid YEp24 having URA3 gene was cleaved with the enzyme HindIII to isolate 1,166 bp DNA fragment containing the full-length of URA3 gene from it. After having been purified in an ordinary manner, the DNA fragment of URA3 gene was ligated with the HindIII-cleaved pCI1 by the use of the T4 DNA ligase to construct a plasmid pCY1 for ATH1 gene disruption. 
 (Formation of ATH1 Gene-disrupted Haploid) 
 According to the method mentioned hereinabove, an a-type haploid yeast (wild strain) was processed to be a strain of ura3, and then transformed with the DNA fragment comprising the ATH1 partial sequence and URA3 ,that had been cleaved with a restriction enzyme PvuII from the plasmid pCY1 (this is for ATH1 gene disruption) and was isolated and purified, according to a lithium acetate process. The non-transformed strain requires uracil in its growth, and the transformant was identified by its character not requiring uracil in its growth. In the same manner, an α-type haploid yeast (wild strain) was processed to be a strain of ura3 according to the method mentioned hereinabove. On the other hand, the plasmid pCY1 for ATH1 gene disruption was cleaved with a restriction enzyme PvuII, and the DNA fragment comprising the ATH1 partial sequence and URA3 was isolated and purified. The ura3 strain was transformed with this DNA according to a lithium acetate process. The non-transformed strain requires uracil in its growth, and the transformant was identified by its character not requiring uracil in its growth. 
 (Confirmation of ATH1 Gene Disruption) 
 The ATH1 gene disruption was theoretically confirmed through PCR. Precisely, the total chromosomal DNA was extracted from both the wild strain and the gene-disrupted strain and each DNA was amplified with the primers of  Sequence Number  1 and  Sequence Number  2, and the thus-amplified DNAs were compared with each other with respect to their length. The data are shown in FIG.  9 . Theoretically, the DNA fragment from the wild strain is amplified to have 1,150 bp, while that from the gene-disrupted strain is to have 2,316 bp. The theoretical data correspond to the data measured, as in FIG. 10, which supports the gene disruption. 
 (Confirmation of ATH1 Gene Inactivation) 
 To confirm the ATH1 gene disruption, the acidic trehalase activity of both wild strains (ATH1, in which the ATH1 gene is not disrupted) and ATH1 gene-disrupted strains (ath1) was measured. Precisely, 18-φ test tubes each charged with 5 ml of a YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) were prepared, in which were separately inoculated platinum loop of cells of each wild strain and platinum loop of cells of each ATH1 gene-disrupted strain, and cultivated therein at 30° C. for 48 hours with shaking. The acidic trehalase activity of the thus-cultivated cells was measured in an ordinary manner. The data obtained are in Table 16. The acidic trehalase activity of the gene-disrupted strains was obviously lowered, as compared with that of the non-disrupted wild strains, and was nearly 0 (zero). This supports the ATH1 gene inactivation in the disrupted strains. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 (Formation of NTH1 and ATH1 Genes-disrupted Strain) 
 Eight NTH1 gene-disrupted strains that were prepared according to the method of Example 1 do not require uracil in their growth. To again introduce the ura3 marker into them, these strains were cultivated on the 5-FOA-containing medium for spontaneous mutation, in the same manner as mentioned above. Of those, the mutant strains having grown in the medium were collected. In the mutant strains, the URA3 gene having been inserted thereinto in the process of NTH1 gene disruption was inactivated through spontaneous mutation. These strains were subjected to ATH1 gene disruption in the same manner as in Example 2. In the resulting strains, the ATH1 gene disruption and the ATH1 gene inactivation were confirmed in the same manner as in Example 2. The diploids of the strains are of practical baker's yeast.

 The mating was effected as follows: First, a pair of a-type strain and α-type strain were separately cultivated and proliferated in YPD media at 30° C. for one day. Nearly the same number of the proliferated cells of the both strains were put into a fresh YPD medium and further cultivated therein at 30° C. for 12 hours. Then, the conjugated yeast cells were isolated, applied onto a YPD-agar medium, and cultivated thereon at 30° C. for 1 or 2 days. Relatively large colonies formed were taken out. It was confirmed that the cells in those colonies have no conjugating ability and that they are larger than the haploid cells through microscopic observation. Thus, the formation of diploid yeast cells was confirmed. 
 EXAMPLE 5 
 Cells of NTH1 gene-disrupted strains, ATH1 gene-disrupted strains and NTH1 and ATH1 genes-disrupted strains were cultivated, and checked for the trehalose content profile therein in the manner mentioned below.

 (*2)The cells grown in the pre-culture were taken out through centrifugation, and washed with deionized water. A part of those cells were used.  
 
 
 
 
 
 All the tested strains gave an yield of from 120 to 140%, relative to the weight of sugar, of the yield given by the commercially-available baker's yeast strain as cultivated in the same manner. The data verify that those strains can be cultivated on an industrial scale, and that the NTH1 and/or ATH1 gene disruption in those strains did not interfere with the requirements including the cell growability and the storage stability necessary to practical baker's yeast. 
 (Time-dependent Variation in Trehalose Content of Strain in Fed-batch Culture) 
 The cultivation process employed herein could be divided into two stages, one being a logarithmic growth phase stage and the other being a stationary phase stage. 
 Of the strains in Tables 17, 18 and 19, cells of 8 strains of T118, T128, their NTH1 gene-disrupted strains, T154 and T164, their ATH1 gene-disrupted strains, A318 and A328, and their NTH1 and ATH1 genes-disrupted strains, AT418 and AT428, were cultivated under the condition noted above, while being sampled in the initial, middle and last stages in each phase, and their trehalose content was measured. The data obtained are shown in FIG.  11 . 
 Strains T118 and T128 were named  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  T118 and  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  T128, respectively, and were deposited in the international depository authority, the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology of Japan, for FERM BP-6096 and FERM BP-6097, respectively. Their than gene-disrupted strains A318 and a328 were named  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  A318 and  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  A328, respectively, and were deposited in the same international depository authority for FERM BP-6039 and FERM BP-6040, respectively. 
 Comparing the wild strain T118 with its trehalase gene-disrupted strains T154 and A318, it is known that the gene disruption obviously resulted in the increase in the trehalose content of the gene-disrupted strains in the final stage of the cell culture, and the trehalose content of the gene-disrupted strains was about 2 times that of the wild strain. The NTH1 gene disruption and the ATH1 gene disruption gave nearly the same result. Comparing T154 and A318 with AT418 showed no synergistic effect of the disruption of the two genes, NTH1 and ATH1. This significantly differs from the above-mentioned report of John Kim, et al. (of the California University) who said that the trehalase gene disruption in baker's yeast resulted in the increase in the trehalose content of the yeast, that the effect of the ATH1 gene disruption is much larger than that of the NTH1 gene disruption, and that the ATH1 and NTH1 genes disruption gave a synergistic effect. It is believed that the difference between the data which John Kim, et al. obtained previously and those which we obtained herein will result from the difference between the laboratory strains which they tested and the practical strains which we tested and from the difference between the laboratory-scale batchwise culture which they tried in their test and the industrial-scale fed-batch culture which we tried in our test. 
 On the contrary, when the wild strain T128 is compared with its trehalase gene-disrupted strains, T164, A328 and AT428, it is known that the trehalose content of the gene-disrupted strains in the final stage of the cell culture was only slightly larger than that of the wild strain. Specifically, there was found no significant difference between the NTH1 gene disruption and the ATH1 gene disruption with respect to their effect on the trehalose accumulation in those strains and even no synergistic effect of the disruption of the two genes, NTH1 and ATH1. 
 In the test of practical baker's yeast strains for their capabilities, generally used are the cells having been cultivated in fed-batch culture as a simulation of industrial-scale culture, for example, in the manner mentioned above. In the test, the intracellular trehalose content could be 8+/−2% or so, relative to the dry cells, and the trehalose content of the wild strain T118 somewhat differs from that of practical baker's yeast strain generally used in the art. As so mentioned hereinabove, most laboratory yeast strains could not apply to the fed-batch culture system. If, however, they are intentionally cultivated in the fed-batch culture system test, while neglecting the production efficiency in the test, their trehalose content will fall between 2 and 4% or so, which significantly differs from the trehalose content of practical strains. In the test of other practical baker's yeast strains shown in the above-mentioned Tables, the ATH1 gene disruption in the wild strains, of which the trehalose content in the final stage of their culture is nearly the same as that of laboratory strains, like T118, resulted in significant increase in the amount of trehalose produced in the NTH1 or ATH1 gene-disrupted strains, but the effect of the NTH1 or ATH1 gene disruption in the other wild strains of which the trehalose production is nearly the same as that of practical baker's yeast generally used in the art was only small. In this point, the laboratory strains shall be differentiated from the practical baker's yeast strains. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 NTH1 gene-disrupted strains, ATH1 gene-disrupted strains and NTH1 and ATH1 genes-disrupted strains were tested for their capabilities in bread production and for their activity in frozen dough. 
 (Bread Making Test of Wild Strains and Trehalase Gene-disrupted Strains) 
 Eight strains of T118, T128, their NTH1 gene-disrupted strains, T154 and T164, their ATH1 gene-disrupted strains A318 and A328, and their NTH1 and ATH1 genes-disrupted strains, AT418 and AT428, all cultivated in Example 5, and also a commercially-available baker's yeast (manufactured by Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd.) were used in preparing dough samples having the composition mentioned below. The samples were tested in accordance with the baker's yeast test method of the Japan Yeast Industry Association, under the bread making procedure shown in Table 20.

 In the bun dough formulation tested herein, the trehalase gene-disrupted strains were significantly superior to the wild strains. Specifically, the ATH1 gene-disrupted strain A318 was more active than its wild strain T118; and the ATH1 gene-disrupted strain A328 was more active than its wild strain T128. The reason will be because the trehalase gene disruption resulted in the increase in the trehalose content of the gene-disrupted strains and in the trehalose content retentiveness thereof. Accordingly, the intracellular trehalose content of the gene-disrupted strains could be kept high, and the intracellular osmotic pressure in those strains could also be kept high. As a result, even in the high-sugar bun dough, the cells of the gene-disrupted strains could keep high fermentation power. The data of the gene-disrupted strains are well comparable to those of the commercially-available yeast. 
 (Frozen Dough Resistance Test) 
 Eight strains of T118, T128, their NTH1 gene-disrupted strains, T154 and T164, their ATH1 gene-disrupted strains A318 and A328, and their NTH1 and ATH1 genes-disrupted strains AT418 and AT428, all cultivated in Example 5, were used in preparing dough samples having the composition mentioned below. The samples were tested in accordance with the frozen dough bread making test method of the Japan Yeast Industry Association, under the bread making procedure mentioned below.

 The data obtained are shown in Table 23 and Table 24 below. As compared with the wild strains, the trehalase gene-disrupted strains had significantly increased frozen dough resistance. The reason will be because the trehalase gene disruption resulted in the increase in the trehalose content of the gene-disrupted strains and also in the trehalose content retentiveness thereof. As a result, the gene-disrupted strains could have increased frozen dough resistance.

 In all tests, it is known that the baking capabilities of the gene-disrupted strains are comparable to or higher than those of the commercially-available baker's yeast strain. Obviously, in addition, the trehalase gene-disrupted strains have higher frozen dough resistance than the wild strain. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 NTH1 gene-disrupted strains, ATH1 gene-disrupted strains and NTH1 and ATH1 genes-disrupted strains were tested for their drying resistance, in the manner mentioned below. 
 Precisely, cells of the strains having been obtained in Example 5 were dewatered to have a water content of at most 68%. Thus was prepared 1.5 kg of pressed raw yeast from each strain. To this was added an aqueous emulsion of sorbitan fatty acid ester in an amount of from 1.5 to 2.0% relative to the dried yeast, and mixed. The resulting mixture was passed through a 0.4 no screen mesh in an extruder. The resulting strings were dried in a fluidized bed drier, in which the temperature of hot air was 50° C. at the inlet, about 10 minutes. After that and just before the temperature of the pellets being dried increased, the inlet temperature was lowered to be 38° C. The pellets were further dried about 50 minutes. In that stage, the temperature of the pellets being dried was not higher than 38° C. The drying end point was when the water content of the dried pellets was 5+/−0.3% as measured with an infrared water content meter. The dried samples were separately stored in vacuum packages. 
 Each dry yeast sample was suspended in water at 40° C. to have a concentration of 3.1%. 5 ml of each yeast suspension was mixed with 15 ml of 13.33% sucrose solution to give 20 ml of a CO 2  production test liquid. Each test liquid was tested for its CO 2  production capacity within a period of 120 minutes, according to the baker's yeast test method of the Japan Yeast Industry Association. The data obtained are shown in FIG.  12  and FIG.  13 . 
 The ATH1 or NTH1 gene-disrupted strains got good drying resistance. As opposed to those, it is obvious that the drying resistance of the ATH1 and NTH1 genes-disrupted strains is comparable to or lower than that of the wild strains. As in FIG.  12  and FIG. 13, the gene-disrupted strains all have a higher trehalose content than the wild strains. This indicates that the mere increase in their trehalose content could not get the cells drying resistance necessary to baker's dry yeast. Trehalose in baker's yeast cells has some influences on the drying resistance, the freezing resistance and the osmotic pressure resistance of the cells. In addition, it has an additional influence on the storability (the shelf-life) of practical baker's yeast. Specifically, the trehalose content of practical baker's yeast gradually decreases while the yeast is stored. During its storage, practical baker's yeast consumes trehalose as the energy source for retaining its activity, and the yeast s trehalose consumption corresponds to the decrease in the trehalose content of the yeast. Dry baker's yeast requires trehalose which acts as the protecting agent while yeast is dried, and consumes trehalose as the energy source when the dry yeast is re-hydrated with water. Therefore, dry baker's yeast not having a satisfactory degree of trehalase activity when it is re-hydrated with water could not ensure the energy necessary to its re-activation. Even if the survival rate of yeast cells being dried and re-hydrated is high, such does not directly meet the requirement for dry baker's yeast. 
 Yeast strains  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  of the same species may have different degrees of intracellular enzymatic activity. As is obvious from the comparison between the data of practical baker's yeast strains shown in the report of Takano, et al. (of National Food Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, red in the Meeting of the Japanese Society for Food Science and Technology in 1997) and in their patent application, Japanese Patent Application No. 9-352016 for ATH1 gene disruption, and those of laboratory strains shown in the report of Monika Destruelle, et al. (of the Freiburg University and in the report of Helmut Holzer, et al. (of the Freiburg University) (see J.B.C. Vol. 268, No. 7, 1993), the trehalase activity of practical baker's yeast strains is higher than that of laboratory strains. Through disruption of either one of trehalase genes in practical strains, the gene-disrupted practical strains got a suitable degree of trehalase activity, or that is they were so modified through the gene disruption that they could have a suitable trehalose content necessary for their drying resistance and could consume trehalose as the energy source when they are re-hydrated with water to exhibit their dough-expanding activity. However, it cannot be considered that laboratory strains could get the same results. 
 Standard laboratory strains of yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  X2180-1A (a-type) and X2180-1B (α-type) (these are known, for example, in a catalogue from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center of the California University) were processed in the same manner as above to prepare an NTH1 gene-disrupted diploid strain and an ATH1 gene-disrupted diploid strain, and these strains were subjected to the drying resistance test. The test data are shown in FIG. 14 (Drying Resistance Test-3). 
 From the data as above, it is known that the baking capabilities of the ATH1 gene-disrupted strains, the NTH1 gene-disrupted strains and the ATH1 and NTH1 genes-disrupted strains are comparable to those of the non-disrupted strains, and the gene-disrupted strains are usable as practical baker's yeast. In addition, the frozen dough resistance of all those gene-disrupted strains is higher than that of the wild strains. The high-sugar dough resistance of the ATH1 gene-disrupted strains and the ATH1 and NTH1 genes-disrupted strains has increased. Regarding the drying resistance of those strains, however, the drying resistance of the ATH 1  gene-disrupted strains and the NTH1 gene-disrupted strains has increased, but the drying resistance of the ATH1 and NTH1 genes-disrupted strains is the same as or lower than that of the wild strains. We, the present inventors have clarified this fact for the first time, and the fact could not be easily derived from the reasoning previously made by some persons who used laboratory strains 
 EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION 
 The ATH1 and/or NTH1 gene-disrupted strains of the invention are of extremely excellent, drying-resistant practical baker's yeast, and the baker's yeast of the invention can be in the form of dry yeast not requiring sugared water for its re-activation but capable of being easily re-activated only with water within a short period of time. Therefore, the dry baker's yeast of the invention can be directly mixed with dough and it can be immediately re-activated in dough. In addition, the baker's yeast of the invention is widely applicable in producing any type of bread.
