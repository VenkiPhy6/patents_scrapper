 The present invention relates to the mixture of anthranilamides and one or more Fungicidal compounds and comprise the method using described mixture.Described mixture has the raising effect of Synergistic.The invention still further relates to this and be combined in purposes in control invertebrate pests and plant pathogenic fungi, especially at protective plant and propagulum in order to avoid plant pathogenic fungi infects or in order to avoid invertebrate pests infects and/or purposes in attacking.The invention still further relates to these and be combined in the purposes improved in plant health and/or crop yield. 
 The typical problem existed in field of pest control needs to reduce the dose rate of active component to reduce or to avoid hostile environment or toxicological effects, but still allow effective pest control. 
 Another problem run into relates to the pest control agent that needs provide effectively control wide spectrum insect. 
 Also need to have down effect concurrently and long time control, i.e. the pest control agent of snap action and long-acting. 
 In many areas, methods of combating harmful insects be not farmer must faced by only problem.Harmful plant pathogenic fungi also can cause considerable damage to crop and other plant.The efficient combination of desinsection and Fungicidally active overcomes needed for this problem.Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a kind of combination, it has good insecticidal activity on the one hand, has good Fungicidally active on the other hand.In addition, desirable to provide the insecticidal activating agent effectively preventing and treating wide spectrum insect.In addition, using of active component should not destroy crop. 
 Be repeatedly with using relevant another difficulty of agricultural chemicals and only use the quick selection that single Pesticidal compound can cause having developed the nature of described reactive compound or the insect of adaptability resistance in many cases.Therefore the pest control agent helping prevent or overcome the resistance of being induced by agricultural chemicals is needed. 
 In addition, need the combination of pesticide compound or compound, it improves plant when using, and this can cause " plant health ", " vigor of plant propagation material " or " plant products of raising ". 
 Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide the agricultural combination solving one or more than one following problems: 
 -depressant dose rate, 
 -improve activity profile, 
 -have control when knocking down active and long concurrently, 
 -improve resistance management, 
 -improve plant health, 
 -improve the vigor of plant propagation material, also referred to as seed vitality, 
 The plant products of-raising. 
 Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide pesticide combination, it solves problem described at least one: depressant dose rate, improve control when activity profile or have concurrently is knocked down active and long, or resistance management. 
 Find that this object is partly or entirely realized by the combination of hereafter defined reactive compound. 
 The present invention relates to comprise Synergistic amount following substances as the pesticide combination of reactive compound: 
 1) the pesticide activity anthranilamides of at least one formula (I) or its stereoisomer, salt, dynamic isomer or N-oxide, or the polymorphic of compound or its stereoisomer, salt, dynamic isomer or N-oxide, eutectic or solvate:

 Plant health, the output of raising 
 Combination of the present invention and composition thereof can be used for improving plant health and/or improving plant products (crop yield) respectively. 
 " plant health " is intended to mean or combination with one another determined plant situation independent by some aspects. 
 An index (index 1) of plant situation is output, and it is crop and/or fruit yield." crop " and " fruit " is interpreted as any plant product utilized further after harvesting, such as, fruit in suitable meaning, vegetables, nut, grain, seed, timber (such as when Silvicultural), flowers (such as when gardening plant, ornamental plants) etc., it anyly has those of economic worth for what produced by plant.A kind of mode of determine output is the thousand corn weight (TGW) of results grain. 
 In one embodiment of the invention, plant products can be presented as thousand corn weight (TGW), stalk output, Grain Yield, tiller, the raising of harvest index and single fringe Grain Yield. 
 Another index (index 2) of plant situation is plant vigor.Plant vigor is also embodied in some aspects, wherein some are visual appearance, such as leaf color, fruit color and appearance, the amount of dead base leaf and/or the blade latitude of emulsion (extent), plant weight, plant height, (lodging) degree that plant is put upside down (verse), tiller or the quantity of branch or cauline leaf, strength and productivity, paniculiform length, solid, root system scope, the strength of root, tight knot degree, especially rhizobium tight knot, sprout, emerge, bloom, the time point that grain is ripe and/or old and feeble, protein content, sugar content etc. 
 In one embodiment of the invention, plant vigor be presented as plant height, there is the panicle quantity of fringe, tiller, the growth of plant spray, every grain quantity of fringe and the raising of greenery area. 
 Another index (index 3) of plant situation is tolerance or the resistance of plants against abiotic stress factors.The abiotic stress of abiotic stress, especially long period can have adverse effect to plant.Abiotic stress is such as by extreme temperature; as hot or the cold or acute variation of temperature or the temperature to particular season exception; arid; extreme humidity is as flood irrigation or waterlogging, and anoxia condition, high salinity, radiation (such as causing the UV radiation improved because ozone layer reduces), the level of ozone improved and organic contamination (such as being caused by the agricultural chemicals of phytotoxicity amount) or inorganic pollution (such as being caused by heavy metal contaminants) cause.Therefore, reduced by the amount of the plant of stress and quality, its crop and fruit.With regard to quality, Reproductive development usually along with on because of the important crop of fruits and seeds impact and had a strong impact on.The synthesis of protein, accumulation and the main temperature influence of storage; Growth postpones due to nearly all stress; Polysaccharide synthesis (structure and storage) reduces or changes: these effects cause living beings to reduce and cause the nutritive value of product to change. 
 In one embodiment of the invention, the tolerance of plant to arid stress (abiotic stress) is embodied in the raising of water application efficiency and the reduction of plant transpiration.
