 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a fusion protein of human epidermal growth factor(“hEGF”) and human angiogenin, and a process for preparing the fusion protein, more specifically, to a fusion protein of hEGF that tracks down the cancer cells expressing hEGF receptors at high level following internalization and angiogenin that exhibits cytotoxicity by degrading ribonucleic acids upon internalization, a process for preparing the fusion protein which employs  E. coli  transformed with an expression vector encoding a gene for the fusion protein, and its therapeutic application as an anticanacer agent. 
 2. Description of the Prior Art 
 Environmental pollution and increase in population of old-aged people cause increase of the rate of cancer by 5% every year. Cancer ranks first as the major cause of death among other diseases and accidents. 
 Chemotherapy has been widely used as an effective way to prevent and cure cancer. However, it has been known that chemotherapy provokes various side-effects, e.g., attacking the normal cells as well as the cancer cells. Due to low specificity for the cancer cells and toxicity for the normal cells, numerous attempts have been made to develop anticancer agents with high specificity and low toxicity. The examples of such attempts include search for the drug with novel mode of action, development of drug delivery system and drug targeting, and use of a secondary agent to aid activity of a primary anticancer agent. 
 Recently, a new method of drug targeting has been studied that is selectively active to the cancer cells by using a chemical agent bound to a carrier which has strong affinity to the cancer cells. As a promising resolution, it has been reported that antibodies against to antigens specific to the cancer cells, such as alpha-fetoprotein, are bound to the chemical agents, ricin, Diphtheria toxin, Pseudomonas toxin, or radioisotopes(see: K. Shikoro et al., Br. Med. Bull., 40:233-239(1984); Vijay et al., Nature, 339:394-397(1989); U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,985; Peter et al., Cancer Res., 54:1008(1994)). However, the antibody-bound chemical agents have some shortcomings, such as difficulty in penetrating the cells, antigenicity of antibody itself, binding to the normal cells, low binding efficiency due to relatively high molecular weight of antibody(see: Pastan et al., Cell, 47:641-648(1986); Hurwitz et al., Cancer Res., 35:1175-1181(1975); Delabye et al., J. Clin. Invest., 77:301-311(1986); Buchegger et al., J. Exp. Med., 158:413-427(1986); Buchegger et al., Cancer, 58:655-661(1986)). 
 Another attempt has been made to develop an anticancer agent using polyamino acids as a carrier since polyamino acids do not exhibit toxicity to the normal cells. After the agent forms a complex by binding to the polyamino acids, it is detached from the complex by the enzymes present in the cancer cells. However, this strategy failed to solve the aforementioned problems(see: Kato et al., J. Med. Chem., 27:1602-1607(1984); EP 112,720; U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,093). 
 As one of attempts for anticancer drug targeting, formation of a protein complex between a toxic protein and a peptide or, a protein capable of binding to the intracellular receptors has been extensively studied, though it has not been fruitful. Such peptides or proteins are TGF(tumor growth factor), MSH(melanocyte stimulating hormone), somatostatin, glucagon, insulin, transferrin, LDL(low density lipoprotein), calcitonin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, bradykinin, and EGF(see: U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,985; Shimizu et al., FEBS Letters, 118:274-278(1980); Cawley et al., Cell, 22:563-570(1980); Simpson et al., Cell, 29:469-473(1982); W085/00369; W083/04030; U.S. Pat. No 4,528,186; EP 46,039; EP 128,733; W085/01284; EP 131,868; U.S. Pat. No. 3,917,824). 
 Also, genetically engineered fusion proteins of peptides and cytotoxins have been generated by binding Diphtheria toxin to TRH(thyrotropin releasing hormone), TRF(transferrin), MSH, and LDL. Usage of these fusion proteins, however, has been restricted due to difficulties in maintaining the receptor binding activity of carrier proteins(see: Bacha et al., J. Biol. Chem., 258:1565-1570(1983); Okeefe et al., J. Biol. Chem., 260:932-937(1985); Murphy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 83:8258-8262 (1986); Japanese Patent Publication No.(Sho)60-163824). 
 Toxicity of a protein complex of EGF and a cytotoxic chemical has not been lowered due to toxicity of the cytotoxic chemical itself and immunotoxicity resulted from antibody formation against the chemical(see: WO88/00837). EP 467,536 describes that genetically engineered TGF-fused to modified Pseudomonas exotoxin A can be used to target bladder cancer. However, it failed to overcome antigenicity of the toxin derived from the microorganism. Japanese Patent Publication No.(Sho) 63-41418 discloses a protein conjugate of EGF and Pseudomonas toxin using a chemical material as a linker. Again, toxicity issue raised by Pseudomonas toxin has remained to be solved. EP 11111 suggests an anticancer agent which is prepared by chemical conjugation of a low molecular weight growth factor with a chemical which binds non-specifically to carboxyl terminal or β-amino terminal of the protein. The prior art is, however, proven to be less satisfactory in the senses of contamination during chemical reaction, denaturation of the protein, and heterogeneicity of the conjugate itself. 
 As mentioned above, research on the cytotoxic agents or microorganism-derived toxins fused to monoclonal antibodies recognizing molecules on the surface of the cancer cells(see: U.S. Pat. No. 4,664, 911; U.S. Pat. No. 4,545,985) or studies on the fusion proteins generated by fusing a growth factor originated from neoplastic tissue and a microorganism-derived toxin(see: Jill et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:21118(1991); Daniel et al., Cell, 22:563-570(1980); Caudhary et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 84:4538-4542(1987)) are still ongoing, however, they have not been fruitful since these studies still need to overcome the problems caused by toxicity of the proteins, chemical contamination, immunotoxicity resulted from antibody formation, non-specific binding of antibodies, difficulty in delivering a high molecular weight fusion protein to the target cells(see: Chung et al., Mol. Cells, 6:125-132(1996)). 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present inventors have made an effort to solve the aforementioned problems of the immunotoxicity resulted from antibody formation and the low targeting efficiency due to a high molecular weight of at least 50 kD, and finally developed a genetically engineered low molecular weight fusion protein consisting of hEGF and angiogenin both of which normally exist in human body and then exhibit no toxicity following overdose administration. Further, the inventors manufactured a large quantity of the fusion protein by cloning and expressing a fusion gene encoding hEGF and angiogenin in bacteria, whose efficacy is substantially improved in comparison with the conventional anticancer agents in the senses that: 1) it selectively inhibits the growth of the cancer cells expressing hEGF receptor; 2) it does not have a detrimental effect on the growth of the normal cells; 3) it does not exhibit toxicity of the conventional chemical anticancer agents; and, 4) it does not cause any serious problem by forming antibody against the fusion protein. 
 A primary object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a fusion protein of hEGF and angiogenin that selectively inhibits growth of the cancer cells expressing hEGF receptors. 
 The other object is to provide a process for preparing the fusion protein by employing recombinant microorganism transformed with an expression vector containing the gene encoding the fusion protein. 
 Another object is to provide an anticancer agent comprising the fusion protein as an active ingredient.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 A fusion protein newly developed in the present invention is formed by connecting a tracer protein of hEGF and a toxic protein of angiogenin that belongs to ribonuclease superfamily through the aid of a appropriate linker, in order to allow proper folding of each protein molecule. As a result, the fusion protein consists of three components: a tracer of hEGF that tracks down the cancer cells; a cytotoxin of angiogenin that kills them; and, a linker which connects the hEGF and the angiogenin to ensure their biological activities. In this regard, hEGF functions to target the fusion protein to the cancer cells expressing hEGF receptors and then becomes internalized in the form of a fusion protein; angiogenin functions to kill the cancer cells by degrading ribonucleic acids upon internalization through a tracer; and, the linker peptide connects the tracer(i.e., hEGF) to the cytotoxin(i.e., angiogenin) and maintains their tertiary structure. 
 As described aboves, the present invention provides a novel fusion protein that successfully overcomes problems of the conventional anticancer agents, such as low targeting efficiency, chemical contamination during manufacturing, antigenicity of a fusion protein, toxicity of a cytotoxin. 
 In the past, fusion proteins used as anticancer agents have exhibited toxicity resulted from antibody formation within 1 week post-administration because of antigenicity induced by the antibody used as a tracer or toxicity of a cytotoxin derived from microorganism. Especially, in the case of fusion protein made of Diphtheria toxin or Pseudomonas toxin, the fusion proteins were not effective for the cancer cells any more, since most of the patients had already had antibodies to the fusion proteins prior to drug administration. 
 On the other hand, a tracer and a cytotoxin employed in the fusion protein of the invention always exist in human body so that the cytotoxin exhibits cytotoxicity only when it is delivered to the target cells by the tracer and then is internalized inside of the cells, which, in turn, provides no toxicity outside of the cells. 
 In general, to increase targeting efficiency of a fusion protein to the cancer cells, it is more favourable to use a fusion protein of small size. In the present invention, targeting efficiency has been much improved by using small molecular weight proteins, which are 6 kD hEGF and 14.4 kD angiogenin. Considering that the conventional fusion proteins are at least 50 kD, a 20.4 kD (6 kD+14.4 kD) fusion protein of the invention is strikingly small in its molecular weight. 
 In addition, to solve the problems of protein denaturation and contamination during chemical conjugation, the inventors did not employ a chemical process, instead, they introduced genetic engineering technique that the genes for a tracer and a cytotoxin are fused through a appropriate linker and then a fusion protein is produced in recombinant microorganism transformed therewith. In this process, each protein component is linked in the molecular ratio of 1:1 or 1:0.5-2 (tracer:toxic protein). As a linker, it is preferable to use a peptide consisting of the appropriate number of amino acids to maintain activity of each protein component, such as, a peptide composed of 0 to 20 amino acids, though glycine, (glycine) 4  serine, or [(glycine) 4  serine] 2 , is most preferred. 
 As a tracer protein, it is possible to use not only human EGF but also animal EGF, TGF, their derivatives, and any low molecular weight peptide or protein which is capable of binding to hEGF receptors. As a cytotoxin, it is possible to use not only angiogenin degrading intracellular RNA but also any human ribonuclease, EDN(eosinophil derived neurotoxin), and their derivatives which belong to ribonuclease superfamily. A cytotoxin can bind to N-terminal or C-terminal of a tracer molecule, though it is more preferable to link N-terminal of a cytotoxin to C-terminal of a tracer. 
 Features of hEGF employed as a tracer in the fusion protein of the invention are as following: 
 1. It is selectively active only on the cancer cells that express hEGF receptors at high level and is not active on the normal cells. 
 2. It is applicable to a broad spectrum of cancers as long as hEGF receptors are expressed at high level in he cancer cells. 
 3. It delivers a cytotoxin efficiently since it is internalized inside of the cancer cells in the form of a fusion protein. 
 4. It is a 6 kD protein consisting of 53 amino acids which is small enough to penetrate the cells with ease. 
 5. It fuses with a cytotoxin with ease since it does not go through the post-translational modification. 
 Features of angiogenin which is employed as a cytotoxin in the fusion protein of the invention are as following: 
 1. It does not induce antibody formation since it is originated from human(present at 0.4 μg/ml in human blood). 
 2. It has tRNase activity in the cell and exhibits toxicity only inside of the cell upon internalization. 
 3. It has small size(14.4 kD protein consisting of 123 amino acids) in comparison with other microorganism-derived toxins such as Diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas toxin, or plant-derived toxin such as ricin so that it is delivered to the target with ease. 
 The use of the fusion protein with the aforementioned features is broad as an anticancer agent for the cancers that express hEGF receptors, such as bladder cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, and prostate cancer.

 EXAMPLE 1 
 Construction of a Gene Encoding hEGF and Angiogenin 
 In order to prepare hEGF gene (SEQ ID No:3), an expression vector pTED(see: Korean Patent Publication No.96-53539, KFCC-10925) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with an expression vector pTE105(see: FIG. 1, Korean Patent Publication No. 96-6121, KCCM-10027), and was used as source for hEGF gene. 
 Human angiogenin gene(SEQ ID No:1) was generated by PCR whose parameters are as follows: 30 pmoles of a primer(SEQ ID No:5) containing EcoR I restriction site and 30 pmoles of the other primer(SEQ ID No:6) containing Hind III site were added to cDNA library prepared from human liver, and subsequently mixed in Premix Top tube(Premix™-TOP, Cat#K2010, Bioneer Corp., Korea; containing 1 unit polymerase, 250 μM mixing solution, 40 μM KCl, 1.5 μM MgCl 2 , and 50 μM Tris-HCl(pH 9.0)), then final volume was increased up to 20 μl by the addition of distilled water, and 30 μl of mineral oil was topped to prevent evaporation of the solution. DNA was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR reaction performed for 5 minutes at 94° C., 2 minutes at 58° C., 30 seconds at 72° C., 1 minute at 94° C., and finally 20 seconds at 72° C. 
 As a result, 380bp PCR products were obtained in which human angiogenin(SEQ ID No:1) and EcoR I and Hind III restriction sites were inserted. The PCR products were cleaved by EcoR I and Hind III and mixed with 2943bp DNA fragment resulted from ECoR I/Hind III restriction digestion of pRSETA(Invitrogen, USA) to generate cohesive ends. Two DNA fragments were ligated together by incubating with 0.5 μl of T4 DNA ligase at 16° C. for 18 hours. 
 The final plasmid was designated as pRSang and used to transform  E. coli  BL21(DE3). FIG. 2 schematically represents the construction strategy of the recombinant vector pRSang. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Construction of a Human Angiogenin Expression Vector pTEang 
 Human angiogenin gene was inserted into an expression vector pTED(KFCC-10925) obtained in Example 1 in order to express the angiogenin gene under OmpA(tac promoter) system. For PCR reaction, two primers were used: one primer(SEQ ID No:7) contains Dsa I restriction site, and the other primer(SEQ ID No:8) contains Ava I and Pst I restriction sites, converted amino acid Arg(CGC) at 122 nd  position from Arg(CGT) in angiogenin, and added Gly at 124 th  position in angiogenin. Recombinant vector pRSang was used as a template. Reaction was performed in 100 ng pRSang, 100 pM of each primer, 2 mM of each dNTP(total 8 mM), reaction solution containing Mg 2+ , and 1 unit of PFU(polymerase). Final volume was increased up to 100 μl. DNA was amplified by 32 cycles at 94° C. for 1 minute, 58° C. for 1 minute, and 72° C. for 70 seconds, and then finally incubated for 5 minutes at 72° C. An amplified 391bp PCR product was separated in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel by electrophoresis, excised from the gel, purified, and then repurified following Dsa I and Pst I restriction digestion. 
 A 391bp PCR product digested by Dsa I/Pst I was mixed with 2777bp DNA fragment prepared from plasmid vector pTED digested by Dsa I/Pst I and then purified. These two DNA fragments were ligated together by 0.5 μl of T4 ligase at 16° C. for 18 hours. The ligated plasmid was designated as pTEang and used to transform  E.coli  JM 101. In order to ensure proper insertion of angiogenin into plasmid vector pTEang, it was digested with Ava I, Sma I, and AlwN I.

 In order to construct a fusion gene of angiogenin and hEGF, an expression vector, pTE4081, containing angiogenin and EGF gene was constructed by fusing a plasmid pTED obtained in Example 1 containing EGF gene and a plasmid pTEang containing angiogenin obtained in Example 2. FIG. 4 schematically represents the construction strategy of the recombinant vector pTE4081. 
 More specifically, a plasmid pTED containing the EGF gene was digested by Blp I and Pst I and then separated in a 1.5%(w/v) agarose gel to obtain a 149bp DNA fragment containing the purified EGF gene. pTEang containing angiogenin was digested by Ava I and Pst I, separated in a 0.8%(w/v) agarose gel to obtain a 3156bp DNA fragment containing the purified angiogenin gene. 
 The linker was generated as following: 100 pmoles of one oligomer(SEQ ID No:9), 100 pmoles of the other oligomer(SEQ ID No:10), 1.5 μl of 10 nM ATP, and 15 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase were mixed and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. and then 5 minutes at 95° C. to phosphorylate 5′-ends. Phosphorylated oligomers were annealed by heating at 95° C. for 5 minutes and slowly cooling down to 30° C. for 3 hours to generate 5′- and 3′-ends which are cohesive with Ava I and Bgl II. The phosphorylated linker was mixed with a 149bp DNA fragment containing the EGF gene and a 3156bp DNA fragment containing the angiogenin gene. Three pieces of DNA fragments were ligated together by incubating with 0.5 μl of T4 DNA ligase at 16° C. for 18 hours. This recombinant plasmid pTE4081 was used to transform  E.coli  JM 101. Proper insertion of angiogenin and EGF into the plasmid vector pTE4081 was confirmed by restriction digestion with Dsa I, AlwN I, Nsi I, and Sma I. To confirm accurate insertion, recombinant plasmid was sequenced using Sanger's dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis(see: Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed.

 EXAMPLE 5 
 Construction of an Expression Vector pTE4083 Containing a Fusion Gene of Angiogenin and hEGF(III) 
 An expression vector containing a fusion gene of hEGF and angiogenin was generated by fusing a 2929bp DNA fragment obtained by Afl II/Pst I restriction digestion of pTE105 and a PCR amplified DNA fragment containing the angiogenin. For PCR reaction, pTEang was used as a template, and two primers(SEQ ID No:13 and SEQ ID No:14) were added. FIG. 6 schematically represents the construction strategy of pTE4083. 
 More specifically, pTE105 containing hEGF gene was digested by Afl II and Pst I, separated in a 0.8 (w/v)% agarose gel by eletrophoresis. A 2929bp fragment containing hEGF gene was excised from the gel and then purified. A PCR reaction was performed using pTEang containing the angiogenin gene as a template, a primer(SEQ ID No:13) containing Afl II site, and a primer(SEQ ID No:14) containing Pst I site. PCR reaction was performed in 100 ng of pTEang, 100 pmoles of each primer, 2 mM of each DNTP, reaction solution containing Mg 2+  and 1 unit of PFU (polymerase). Final volume was increased up to 100 μl. PCR parameters were as following: 32 cycles 94° C. for 1 minute, 58° C. for 1 minute, 72° C. for 70 seconds, and 94° C. for 30 seconds, finally incubated for 5 minutes at 72° C. An amplified 407bp PCR product containing the angiogenin gene was separated in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, purified from the gel, and digested by Afl II and Pst I. 
 The aforementioned 2929bp PCR product containing hEGF gene digested by Afl II/Pst I and the 407bp PCR product containing the angiogenin gene digested by Afl II/Pst I were mixed together and then subject to ligation by incubating with 0.5 μl of T4 DNA ligase at 16° C. for 18 hours to generate pTE4083. Plasmid pTE4083 was used to transform  E.coli  JM 101. Proper insertion of the anigogenin gene and the hEGF gene into plasmid vector pTE4084 was confirmed by restriction digestion using AlwN I, BspM I, Afl II, and Pst I. Finally, accurate insertion was reconfirmed by Sanger's dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis. 
   E.coli  JM 101 transformed by plasmid pTE4083 was designated as  E.coli  JM101-plasmid pTE4083 and was deposited with Korean Culture Center of Microorganism(KCCM), an international depository authority located at 134 Shinchon-Dong, Seodaemun-Ku, Seoul, Korea, under an accession No. KCCM-10106 on Sep. 4, 1997. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 Construction of an Expression Vector pTE4084 Containing a Fusion Gene of Angiogenin and hEGF(IV) 
 Another expression vector pTE4084 containing a fusion gene of angiogenin and hEGF was generated in a similar fashion as in Example 5 except that a 410bp DNA fragment containing the angiogenin was amplified using two primers (SEQ ID. No:14 and SEQ ID No:15). FIG. 7 schematically represents the construction strategy of recombinant vector pTE4084. Proper insertion of the genes into the vector was confirmed in the same way as in Example 5. 
   E.coli  JM 101 transformed with plasmid pTE4084 was designated as  E.coli  JM101-pTE4084 and deposited with Korean Culture Center of Microorganism(KCCM), an international depository authority located at 134 Shinchon-Dong, Seodaemun-Ku, Seoul, Korea, under an accession No. KCCM-10107 on Sep. 4, 1997. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 Construction of an Expression Vector pTE4089 Containing a Fusion Gene of Angiogenin and hEGF(V) 
 Three pieces of DNA were ligated together to generate an expression vector pTE4089 containing a fusion gene of angiogenin and hEGF. The first 3001bp fragment contains the part of angiogenin gene and hEGF gene prepared by Nsi I/BstE II digestion of pTE4083. The second Nsi I/BamH I fragment contains a part of hEGF gene prepared by PCR amplification using pTE4083 as a template and two primers(SEQ ID No:25 and SEQ ID No:26). The last BamH I/BstE II fragment contains a part of the angiogenin gene prepared by PCR amplification using pTE4083 as a template and two primers(SEQ ID No:14 and SEQ ID No:27). FIG. 8 schematically represents the construction strategy of the recombinant vector pTE4089. 
 More specifically, pTE4083 containing angiogenin and hEGF was digested by Nsi I and BstE II. A 3001bp DNA fragment containing hEGF and the part of angiogenin gene was separated in a 0.8%(w/v) agarose gel. 
 A DNA fragment containing the part of hEGF gene was prepared by PCR amplification using pTE4083 as a template and a primer containing Nde I restriction site(SEQ ID No:25) and the other primer containing BamH I site restriction site(SEQ ID No:26). PCR reaction was performed in 100 ng of pTE4083(1 μl), 100 pmoles of each primer, 2 mM of each DNTP, reaction solution containing Mg 2+ , and 1 unit of PFU(polymerase). Volume of the reaction mixture was increased up to 100 μl. The PCR mixture was preheated at 94° C. for 1 minute, and denatured at 94° C. for 30 seconds, annealed at 58° C. for 1 minute, and polymerized at 72° C. for 2 minutes. Denaturation, annealing, and polymerization were repeated 35 cycles and then finally DNA was amplified at 72° C. for 5 minutes. 
 A DNA fragment containing the part of the angiogenin gene was prepared by PCR reaction using a primer containing a BamH I restriction site(SEQ ID No:27) and the other primer containing a Pst I restriction site(SEQ ID No:14) in the same manner as described above. A 171bp hEGF fragment amplified by PCR and a 400bp angiogenin fragment were separated in a 1%(w/v) agarose gel, purified, and then digested by BamH I. 
 Both fragments were re-separated and re-purified after restriction digestion of the hEGF with Nsi I and digestion of the angiogenin with BstE II. 
 A 3001bp fragment containing hEGF and angiogenin, a 108bp fragment prepared by PCR reaction, and a 236bp angiogenin fragment were mixed in 0.5 μl of T4 DNA ligase and then incubated at 16° C. for 18 hours to generate pTE4089 which was used to transform  E.coli  JM 101. Proper insertion of the angiogenin and the hEGF into a plasmid vector pTE4089 was confirmed by restriction digestion with AlwN I, BspM I, BamH I, Afl II, and Pst I following electrophoresis in a 1%(w/v) agarose gel. Finally, Sanger's dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis was used to ensure accurate insertion(see: SEQ ID No:23).

 Another expression vector pTE40810 containing a fusion gene of angiogenin and hEGF was prepared in the same manner as in Example 7, except that a 415bp DNA fragment was amplified using a different primer (SEQ ID No:28) and then digested by BamH I/BstE II to generate a 251bp fragment for DNA ligation. FIG. 9 schematically represents the construction strategy of a recombinant vector pTE40810. Accurate insertion of the fusion gene was confirmed in the same manner as in Example 7(see: SEQ ID No:24). 
 EXAMPLE 9

 In order to generate a fusion gene of angiogenin-hEGF-angiogenin, a 3313bp vector fragment was obtained by separating Pst I/Afl II digested pTE4082 obtained in Example 4 in a 0.8%(w/v) agarose gel. A 416bp fragment of a fusion gene containing angiogenin, a linker, and 3′ end of hEGF was obtained by separating Afl II/Pst I digested pTE4089 obtained from Example 7 in a 1.2%(w/v) agarose gel. 
 A 416bp fragment and a 3313bp fragment were mixed together and ligated by 0.51l of T4 DNA ligase at 16° C. for 18 hours to generate pTE40815. FIG. 10 schematically represents the construction strategy of pTE40815. A plasmid pTE40815 was used to transform  E.coli  JM 101. Proper insertion of a fusion gene of angiogenin-hEGF-angiogenin into a plasmid vector pTE40815 was confirmed by restriction digestion with AlwN I, BspM I, BamH I, Afl II, and Pst I. Finally, accurate insertion was confirmed by Sanger's dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis(see: SEQ ID No:29). 
 EXAMPLE 10

A 324bp fragment of a fusion gene containing hEGF and, a linker, and 3′ end of angiogenin was obtained by separating Pst I/BstE II digested pTE4082 obtained in Example 4 in a 1.2%(w/v) agarose gel. A 324bp fragment and a 3195bp fragment were mixed together and ligated by 0.5 μl of T4 DNA ligase at 16° C. for 18 hours to generate pTE40816. FIG. 11 schematically represents the construction strategy of the recombinant vector pTE40816. A plasmid pTE40816 was used to transform  E.coli  JM 101. Proper insertion of a fusion gene of hEGF-angiogenin-hEGF into a plasmid vector pTE40816 was confirmed by restriction digestion with AlwN I, BspM I, BamH I, Afl II, and Pst I. Finally, accurate insertion was confirmed by Sanger's dideoxynucleotide sequencing analysis(see: SEQ ID No:30). 
 EXAMPLE 11 
 Expression of a Fusion Protein of Angiogenin and hEGF in Transformed  E.coli  JM 101 
   E. coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4081, pTE4082, pTE4083, pTE4084, pTE4089, or pTE40810 which are obtained from Examples 3 to 8 was inoculated in 2 ml tetracycline-LB media and then incubated at 37° C. for 18 hours for seed culture. 2 ml of seed culture was inoculated in 100 ml of tetracycline-LB media and incubated at 37° C. When O.D. 600  reached 0.7-1.0, IPTG(isopropyl β-thiogalacto-pyranoside) was added at final concentration of 1 mM to induce expression of a fusion protein. After addition of IPTG at final concentration of 1 mM, the culture was incubated for additional 20 hours. The bacterial culture was harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 g for 15 minutes at 4° C., analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an anti-hEGF antibody and an anti-angiogenin antibody(see: FIGS.  12 (A),  12 (B),  13 (A), and  13 (B)). 
 FIG.  12 (A) shows the result obtained from SDS-PAGE of the bacterial cultures of  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4081, pTE4082, pTE4083, or pTE4084. FIG.  12 (B) shows the result obtained from the Western blot of the SDS-PAGE using an anti-hEGF antibody. In FIGS.  12 (A) and  12 (B),  lane  1 represents molecular weight marker;  lane  2, supernatant from culture of  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4081;  lane  3, supernatant from  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4082;  lane  4, supernatant from  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4083;  lane  5, supernatant from  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4084. 
 FIG.  13 (A) shows the result of SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the bacterial culture of  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE4089. FIG.  13 (B) shows the result of SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of bacterial culture of  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE40810. In FIG.  13 (A) lane M represents molecular weight marker; land a represents SDS-PAGE of supernatant of culture of IPTG-induced  E.coli  JM 101 transformant; lane b, Western blot analysis using an anti-hEGF antibody; lane c, Western blot analysis using an anti-angiogenin antibody. In FIG.  13 (B) lane M represents molecular weight marker; lane a, SDS-PAGE of supernatant of  E.coli  JM 101 transformant prior to IPTG induction; lane b, SDS-PAGE of supernantant of  E.coli  JM 101 transformants after IPTG-induction; lane c and d, Western blot analysis using an anti-hEGF antibody; and, lane e and f, Western blot analysis using an anti-angiogenin antibody. 
 As shown in FIGS.  12 (A),  12 (B),  13 (A), and  13 (B), a fusion protein of angiogenin(SEQ ID No:2) and hEGF(SEQ ID No:4) was expressed at high level. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that sufficient amount of the fusion protein of angiogenin and hEGF from  E.coli  JM 101 transformed by pTE40815 obtained from Example 9 and pTE40816 obtained from Example 10 will be also expressed at high level. 
 EXAMPLE 12 
 Purification of a Fusion Gene and Amino Acid Sequencing 
 LB media was inoculated by  E.coli  transformed with one of the expression vectors described in Example 11, i.e., pTE4081, pTE4082, pTE4083, pTE4084, pTE4089, pTE40810, pTE40815, and pTE40816), subsequently cultured at 37° C. until O.D. 600  reached 1.0, added IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM to induce expression of a fusion protein, and finally cultured for additional 20 hours. The bacterial culture was harvested by centrifugation to obtain cell pellets. Cells were lysed by lysozyme or osmotic shock to obtain the protein which was subsequently separated in a 14% SDS-PAGE gel. A desired protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. A transferred protein band was excised from a PVDF membrane and then extracted with a protein extraction kit for amino acid sequencing. More specifically, the SDS-PAGE gel was transferred onto a PVDF membrane and stained in Ponseau S. The band representing a fusion protein was excised using a razor blade to extract the protein which was used for amino acid sequencing using an amino acid sequence analyzer with a standard operation method. 
 SEQ ID. No:17-20, 21-22, and 31-32 were designated to the fusion proteins. SEQ ID No:17 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of angiogenin-glycine-EGF expressed from pTE4081, SEQ ID No:18 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of angiogenin-(glycine) 4 serine-EGF expressed from pTE4082, SEQ ID No:19 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of EGF-angiogenin expressed from pTE4083, SEQ ID No:20 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of EGF-glycine-angiogenin expressed from pTE4084, SEQ ID No:21 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of EGF-(glycine) 4 serine-angiogenin expressed from pTE4089, SEQ ID No:22 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion proteins of EGF[(glycine) 4 serine] 2 -angiogenin expressed from pTE40810, SEQ ID No:31 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of angiogenin-(glycine) 4 serine-EGF-(glycine) 4 serine-angiogenin expressed from pTE40815, and SEQ ID No:32 is an amino acid sequence of a fusion protein of EGF-(glycine) 4  serine-angiogenin-(glycine) 4 serine-EGF expressed from pTE40816 
 A sample containing EGF-(glycine) 4  serine-angiogenin was subject to heparin-Sepharose column chromatography(heparin-Sepharose CL-4B, Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., USA) to elute the bound proteins with a phosphate buffer containing 1M NaCl. The fractions were pooled and subject to DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography(DEAE-Sephadex A-25, Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., USA) and purified proteins attached to resins in phosphate buffer containing 0.4-0.7M NaCl to measure receptor binding activities and tRNase activities. 
 EXAMPLE 13 
 Receptor Binding Activity of a Fusion Protein 
 Binding activity of a fusion protein was measured by competitive binding between a sample and EGF labelled with an isotope, where  125 I-EGF and the sample were added together to A431 cells(ATCC: CRL-1555) that express EGF receptors at high level on the cell surface. More specifically, A431 cells were plated on 24 well plates at 4×10 4  cells/ml, cultured until the cells reached confluency, and then fixed in 10%(v/v) formaldehyde. Subsequently, 20 μl of each  125 I-labelled EGF and the sample solution was added to each well to bind to the receptors competitively. Unbound EGF was washed out and cells were detached from the wells to count the radioactivity with a γ-counter. Cpm value was converted to % binding activity and standard curve was obtained with the concentration of control and % binding activity. Binding activity of the sample was decided by substituting % binding activity of the sample to the standard curve and compared with the binding activity of EGF(see: Table 1).

Reaction was interrupted by an equal volume of 6% perchloric acid. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 10 minutes and used to measure optical density at 260 nm from which the standard curve was made to measure RNase activity.

 EXAMPLE 17 
 Anticancer Effect of a Toxic Fusion Protein In Vivo 
 To evaluate anticancer activity of the fusion protein in vivo, A431 cultured cells were transferred subcutaneously to the abdominal region of an immunodeficient nude mouse(20-25 g body weight) at 2×10 7  in 0.2 ml. When the proper size of tumor was formed, tumor was removed from the mouse under sterilization condition and cut into pieces of 2-3 mm to be transferred subcutaneously with a troca. When the size of the transplanted tumor of the nude mouse reached 80 ml, mice were divided into 5 groups(6 mice in one group) for i.v. injection. 100 μg/kg body weight of the fusion protein and angiogenin were administered by i.v. injection every 3 day for 4 weeks. After final administration, the area of the tumor-surface was measured by vernier calipers. 
 The tumor cells were excised after 4 weeks and measured for the weight(see: Table 5). FIG. 14 (A) and FIG.  14 (B) are photographs showing the size of the tumors from mice injected with PBS(phosphate buffered saline) and hEGF-(glycine) 4 serine-angiogenin, respectively, where each number indicates the tumor taken from the mouse sacrificed at 3 day interval after final administration.

 As clearly demonstrated in Table 5, growth of tumors in the mice received the fusion proteins was dramatically inhibited in comparison with that of tumors in mice received angiogenin only. Death or symptoms caused by side effects was not observed while inhibitory effect on tumor growth was observed even with naked eyes. 
 Acute Toxicity Test 
 Acute toxicity test was performed to confirm low toxicity of the fusion protein of the present invention: the fusion protein generated in the Example described as above ‘EGF-(glycine) 4 serine-anigiogenin’ was injected in the abdominal region of male mice(ICR mouse, 20-25 g body weight, 5 mice in one group) at 0.1 to 100 mg/kg. Subsequently, the mice were caged and observed for general symptoms. After 7 days, the number of the dead mice was counted. However, median lethal dose(LD 50 , mg/kg) was not measurable since only 1 mouse died in the group that received 100 mg/kg. As a result, it is obvious that toxicity of the fusion protein is strikingly low since LD 50  is much higher than 100 mg/kg. 
 As clearly illustrated and demonstrated as aboves, the present invention provides a fusion protein which is superior to the conventional fusion proteins used as anticancer agents, in light of the following points: first, it overcomes immunotoxicity issue since the human-derived protein components do not induce antibody formation; second, it selectively kills the cancer cells with difference of 1000 fold in IC 50  in spite of its low molecular weight, though each component itself does not have activity to the cancer cells. Therefore, the fusion protein of the invention may be practically applied for treatment of the tumors that express hEGF receptors at high level.
