 embodiment C 
 
 Rod method (Alternaria) genus test (tomato)/preventative 
 The QST30002 (B19) be dissolved in acetone/dimethylacetylamide (24.5/24.5 weight portion) and alkylaryl polyglycol ether (1 weight portion), reactive compound (1 weight portion) or its combination are diluted with water to desired concn. 
 The rate of application of QST30002 refers to the amount of dry hay bacillus AQ30002 (also referred to as QST300202) (NRRL accession number B-50421). 
 In order to test prophylactic activity, the preparation of reactive compound is sprayed on young plant with the rate of application of regulation.After spray-painting becomes dry, by the moisture spore suspension inoculation of this plant with alternaria solani sorauer (Alternaria solani), then by it at about 20 DEG C and relative atmospheric humidity is keep in the culturing room of 100%. 
 Inoculate latter 3 days and assess described test.0% means the drug effect corresponding to undressed control group, and the drug effect of 100% means not observe disease. 
 The activity that following table clearly demonstrates viewed active agent combinations of the present invention is greater than calculated activity, namely there is synergistic effect.
