The entire teachings of the above provisional applications are incorporated herein by reference.      FIELD OF THE INVENTION      This invention relates to a novel farnesylated dibenzodiazepinone, named ECO-04601, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, and to methods for obtaining the compound. One method of obtaining the compound is by cultivation of a novel strain of Micromonospora sp., i.e., 046-EC011 or [S01]046; another method involves expression of biosynthetic pathway genes in transformed host cells. The present invention further relates to Micromonospora sp.  strains 046-EC011 and [S01]046, to the use of ECO-04601 and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives as pharmaceuticals, in particular to their use as inhibitors of cancer cell growth, bacterial cell growth, mammalian lipoxygenase, and for treating acute and chronic inflammation, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising ECO-04601 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative thereof.  Finally, the invention relates to novel polynucleotide sequences and their encoded proteins, which are involved in the biosynthesis of ECO-04601. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION      The euactinomycetes are a subset of a large and complex group of Gram-positive bacteria known as actinomycetes. Over the past few decades these organisms, which are abundant in soil, have generated significant commercial and scientific interest as a result of the large number of therapeutically useful compounds, particularly antibiotics, produced as secondary metabolites. The intensive search for strains able to produce new antibiotics has led to the identification of hundreds of new species.      Many of the euactinomycetes, particularly Streptomyces and the closely related Saccharopolyspora genera, have been extensively studied. Both of these genera produce a notable diversity of biologically active metabolites. Because of the commercial significance of these compounds, much is known about the genetics and physiology of these organisms.      Another representative genus of euactinomycetes, Micromonospora, has also generated commercial interest. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,541,181 (Ohkuma et al.) discloses a dibenzodiazepinone compound, specifically 5-farnesyl-4,7,9-trihydroxy-dibenzodiazepin-11-one (named "BU-4664L"), produced by a known euactinomycetes strain, Micromonospora sp. M990-6 (ATCC 55378). The Ohkurma et al. patent reports that BU-4664L and its chemically synthesized di- and tri-alkoxy and acyloxy derivatives possess anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor cell activities.      Although many biologically active compounds have been identified from bacteria, there remains the need to obtain novel naturally occurring compounds with enhanced properties. Current methods of obtaining such compounds include screening of natural isolates and chemical modification of existing compounds, both of which are costly and time consuming. Current screening methods are based on general biological properties of the compound, which require prior knowledge of the structure of the molecules. Methods for chemically modifying known active compounds exist, but still suffer from practical limitations as to the type of compounds obtainable.  Thus, there exists a considerable need to obtain pharmaceutically active compounds in a cost-effective manner and with high yield. The present invention solves these problems by providing a novel strain of Micromonospora capable of producing a potent new therapeutic compound, as well as reagents (e.g., polynucleotides, vectors comprising the polynucleotides and host cells comprising the vectors) and methods to generate novel compounds by de novo biosynthesis rather than by chemical synthesis.      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION      In one aspect, the invention relates to a compound of the formula I i n (Formula II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.      In another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I i HO or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Similarly, the terms "aralkenyl" and "heteroaralkenyl" refer to an aryl group or a heteroaryl group, respectively bonded directly through an alkene group, such as benzyl. Aralkenyl and heteroaralkenyl may be optionally substituted as the aryl and heteroaryl groups.      The compounds of the present invention can possess one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and can exist as optical isomers forming mixtures of racemic or non-racemic compounds. The compounds of the present invention are useful as single isomers or as a mixture of stereochemical isomeric forms. ~iastereoisomers, i.e., nonsuperimposable stereochemical isomers, can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes.     The invention encompasses isolated or purified compounds. An "isolated" or "purified" compound refers to a compound which represents at least 10%, 20%, 50%, 80% or 90% of the compound of the present invention present in a mixture, provided that the mixture comprising the compound of the invention has demonstrable (i.e. statistically significant) biological activity including antibacterial, cytostatic, cytotoxic, antiinflammatory or enzyme inhibitory action when tested in conventional biological assays known to a person skilled in the art.      The terms "farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producing microorganism" and "producer of farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone," as used herein, refer to a microorganism that carries genetic information necessary to produce a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound, whether or not the organism naturally produces the compound. The terms apply equally to organisms in which the genetic information to produce the farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound is found in the organism as it exists in its natural environment, and to organisms in which the genetic information is introduced by recombinant techniques.  Specific organisms contemplated herein include, without limitation, organisms of the family Micromonosporaceae, of which preferred genera include Micromonospora, Actinoplanes and Dactylosporangium; the family Streptomycetaceae, of which preferred genera include Streptomyces and Kitasatospora; the family Pseudonocardiaceae, of which preferred genera are Amycolatopsis and Saccharopolyspora; and the family Actinosynnemataceae, of which preferred genera include Saccharothrix and Actinosynnema; however the terms are intended to encompass all organisms containing genetic information necessary to produce a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound. A preferred producer of a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound includes microbial strain EC011, a deposit of which was made on March 7, 2003, with the International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC), Bureau of Microbiology, Health Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2, under Accession No.  I DAC 070303-01.      The term "gene" means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain; it includes regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) as well as, where applicable, intervening regions (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).     The terms "gene locus, "gene cluster," and "biosynthetic locus" refer to a group of genes or variants thereof involved in the biosynthesis of a farnesyl benzodiazepinone compound. The biosynthetic locus in strain 046-EC011 that directs the production of ECO-04601 is often referred to herein, in both the written description and Figures, as "046D." Genetic modification of gene locus, gene cluster or biosynthetic locus refers to any genetic recombinant techniques known in the art including mutagenesis, inactivation, or replacement of nucleic acids that can be applied to generate variants of ECO-04601.      A DNA or nucleotide "coding sequence" or "sequence encoding" a particular polypeptide or protein, is a DNA sequence which is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide or protein when placed under the control of an appropriate regulatory sequence. "Oligonucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid, generally of at least 10, preferably 15 and more preferably at least 20 nucleotides in length, preferably no more than 100 nucleotides in length, that are hybridizable to a genomic DNA molecule, a cDNA molecule, or an mRNA molecule encoding a gene, mRNA, cDNA or other nucleic acid of interest.    A promoter sequence is "operably linked to" a coding sequence recognized by RNA polymerise which initiates transcription at the promoter and transcribes the coding sequence into mRNA.      The term "replicon" as used herein means any genetic element, such as a plasmid, cosmid, chromosome or virus, that behaves as an autonomous unit of polynucleotide replication within a cell. A "expression vector" or "vector" is a replicon in which another polynucleotide fragment is attached, such as to bring about the replication and/or expression of the attached fragment. "Plasmids" are designated herein by a lower case "p" preceded or followed by capital letters and/or numbers. The starting plasmids disclosed herein are commercially available, publicly available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from available plasmids in accordance with published procedures. In addition, equivalent plasmids to those described herein are known in the art and will be apparent to the skilled artisan.      The terms "express" and "expression" means allowing or causing the information in a gene or DNA sequence to become manifest, for example producing a protein by activating the cellular functions involved in transcription and translation 0005-7~CT-9CA   of a corresponding gene or DNA sequence. A DNA sequence is expressed in or by a cell to form an "expression product" such as a protein. The expression product itself, e.g. the resulting protein, may also be said to be "expressed" by the cell. An expression product can be characterized as intracellular, extracellular or secreted. "Digestion" of DNA refers to enzymatic cleavage of the DNA with a restriction enzyme that acts only at certain sequences in the DNA. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements were used as would be known to the ordinary skilled artisan. For analytical purposes, typically 1 pg of plasmid or DNA  fragment is used with about 2 units of enzyme in about 20 pl of buffer solution. For the purpose of isolating DNA fragments for plasmid construction, typically 5 to 50 pg of DNA are digested with 20 to 250 units of enzyme in a larger volume. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular enzymes are specified by the manufacturer.  Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37°C are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier's instructions. After digestion the gel electrophoresis may be performed to isolate the desired fragment.     The term "isolated" as used herein means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g. the natural environment where the material is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally occurring polynucleotide or polypeptide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide, which is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such polynucleotides could be part of a vector and/or such polynucleotides or polypeptides could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that the vector or composition is not part of the natural environment.      The term "restriction fragment" as used herein refers to any linear DNA generated by the action of one or more restriction enzymes.    The term "transformation" means the introduction of a foreign gene; foreign nucleic acid, DNA or RNA sequence to a host cell, so that the host cell will express the introduced gene or sequence to produce a desired substance, typically a protein or enzyme coded by the introduced gene or sequence. The introduced gene or sequence may also be called a "cloned" or "foreign" gene or sequence, may include regulatory or control sequences, such as start, stop, promoter, signal, secretion, or other sequences used by a cell's genetic machinery. The gene or sequence may include nonfunctional sequences or sequences with no known function. A host cell that receives and expresses introduced DNA or RNA has been "transformed" and is a "transformant" or a "clone" or "recombinant". The DNA or RNA introduced to a host cell can come from any source, including cells of the same genus or species as the host cell, or cells of a different genus or species.      The terms "recombinant polynucleotide" and "recombinant polypeptide" as used herein mean a polynucleotide or polypeptide which by virtue of its origin or manipulation is not associated with all or a portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide with which it is associated in nature and/or is linked to a polynucleotide or polypeptide other than that to which it is linked in nature.  The term "host cell" as used herein, refer to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells which are used as recipients of the recombinant polynucleotides and vectors provided herein. In one embodiment, the host cell is a prokaryote.     The terms "open reading frame" and "ORF" as used herein refers to a region of a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a polypeptide; this region may represent a portion of a coding sequence or a total coding sequence. As used herein and as known in the art, the term "identity" is the relationship between two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. Identity can be readily calculated (see, e.g., Computation Molecular Biology, Lesk, A.M., eds., Oxford University Press, New York (1998), and Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D.W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993), both of which are incorporated by reference herein). While there exist a number of methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987); and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov., M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991 )). Methods commonly employed to determine identity between sequences include, for example, those disclosed in Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J.  Applied Math. (1988) 48:1073. "Substantially identical," as used herein, means there is a very high degree of homology (preferably 100% sequence identity) between subject polynucleotide sequences. However, polynucleotides having greater than 90%, or 95% sequence identity may be used in the present invention, and thus sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence can be tolerated. As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, who has a disorder, e.g., a disease or condition, a symptom of disease, or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve, or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease, or the predisposition toward disease.      As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" comprises a pharmacologically effective amount of a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmacologically effective amount," "therapeutically effective amount" or simply "effective amount"  refers to that amount of a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.      The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.     ~00~-7PCT-9CA   The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to both acid addition salts and base addition salts. The nature of the salt is not critical, provided that it is pharmaceutically acceptable. Exemplary acid addition salts include, without limitation, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, carbonic, sulphuric, phosphoric, formic, acetic, citric, tartaric, succinic, oxalic, malic, glutamic, propionic, glycolic, gluconic, malefic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, pantothenic, benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, mesylic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, algenic, /3-hydroxybutyric, malonic, galactaric, galacturonic acid and the like. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include, without limitation, metallic salts made from aluminium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, lysine, procaine and the like. Additional examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are listed in Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66:2. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from a farnesyi dibenzodiazepinone by treating the compound with the appropriate acid or base.      II. Farnesylated Dibenzodiazepinone Compounds In one aspect, the invention relates to a novel farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone, referred to herein as "ECO-04601" and having the chemical structure represented by the following formula:        N      UH      N      OH      HO      ECO-04601 may be described as a new dibenzodiazepinone having a 10-farnesyl substituent located on the nitrogen atom in the 10 position of the dibenzodiazepine ring (i.e., the amide nitrogen in the diazepinone ring), and three phenolic hydroxy substituents in the 4,6 and 8 positions of the dibenzodiazepinone ring.

III. Method of MakincLa Farnesyl Dibenzodiazepinone by Fermentation In one embodiment, ECO-04601 is obtained by cultivating a novel strain of Micromonospora, namely Micromonospora sp. strain 046-EC011. Strain 046-EC011 was deposited on March 7, 2003, with the International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC), Bureau of Microbiology, Health Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2, under Accession No. 070303-01. The deposit of the strain was made under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for Purposes of Patent Procedure. The deposited strains will be irrevocably and without restriction or condition released to the public upon the issuance of a patent. The deposited strains are provided merely as convenience to those skilled in the art and are not an admission that a deposit is required for enablement, such as that required under 35 U.S.C. ~112. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to use of the particular strain 046-EC011. Rather, the present invention contemplates the use of other ECO-04601 producing organisms, such as mutants or variants of 046-ECO11 that can be derived from this organism by known means such as X-ray irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, treatment with nitrogen mustard, phage exposure, antibiotic selection and the like; or through the use of recombinant genetic engineering techniques, as described in Section IV below.      The farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds of the present invention may be biosynthesized by various microorganisms. Microorganisms that may synthesize the compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to bacteria of the order Actinomycetales, also referred to as actinomycetes. Non-limiting examples of members belonging to the genera of Actinomycetes include Nocardia, Geodermatophilus, Actinoplanes, Micromonospora, Nocardioides, Saccharothrix, Amycolatopsis, Kutzneria, Saccharomonospora, Saccharopolyspora, Kitasatospora, Streptomyces, Microbispora, Streptosporangium, and Actinomadura. The taxonomy of actinomycetes is complex and reference is made to Goodfellow, Suprageneric Classification ofActinomycetes (1989); 8ergey's Manual of Systematic bacteriology, Voi. 4 (Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, pp. 2322-2339); and to Embley and Stackebrandt, ''The molecular phylogeny and systematics of the actinomycetes,"' Annu. Rev. Microbiol. (1994) 48:257-289, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, for genera that may synthesize the compounds of the invention.      Farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producing microorganisms are cultivated in culture medium containing known nutritional sources for actinomycetes. Such media having assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen, plus optional inorganic salts and other known growth factors at a pH of about 6 to about 9. Suitable media include, without limitation, the growth media provided in Table 16. Microorganisms are cultivated at incubation temperatures of about 18 °C to about 40 °C for about 3 to about 40 days.    The culture media inoculated with the farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producing microorganisms may be aerated by incubating the inoculated culture media with agitation, for example, shaking on a rotary shaker, or a shaking water bath.  Aeration may also be achieved by the injection of air, oxygen or an appropriate gaseous mixture to the inoculated culture media during incubation. Following cultivation, the farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds can be extracted and isolated from the cultivated culture media by techniques known to a skilled person in the art and/or disclosed herein, including for example centrifugation, chromatography, adsorption, filtration. For example, the cultivated culture media can be mixed with a suitable organic solvent such as n-butanol, n-butyl acetate or 4-methyl-2-pentanone, the organic layer can be separated for example, by centrifugation followed by the removal of the solvent, by evaporation to dryness or by evaporation to dryness ~00~-71'CT-9CA   under vacuum. The resulting residue can optionally be reconstituted with for example water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol or a mixture thereof, and re-extracted with a suitable organic solvent such as hexane, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride or a mixture thereof. Following removal of the solvent, the compounds may be further purified by the use of standard techniques, such as chromatography.      The farnesyl dibenzodiapezinones biosynthesized by microorganisms may optionally be subjected to random and/or directed chemical modifications to form compounds that are derivatives or structural analogs. Such derivatives or structural analogs having similar functional activities are within the scope of the present invention. Farnesyl dibenzodiapezinone compounds may optionally be modified using methods known in the art and described herein.   IV. Method of Making a Farnesyl Dibenzodiazepinone by Recombinant Technology In another embodiment, the present invention relates to nucleic acid molecules that encode proteins useful in the production of farnesyl benzodiazepinones. Specifically, the present invention provides recombinant DNA vectors and nucleic acid molecules that encode all or part of the biosynthetic locus in strain 046-EC011, which directs the production of ECO-04601, and is referred to herein as "046D." The invention further includes genetic modification of 046D  using conventional genetic recombinant techniques, such as mutagenesis, inactivation, or replacement of nucleic acids, to produce chemical variants of ECO-04601.     The invention thus provides a method for making a farnesyl benzodiazepinone compound using a transformed host cell comprising a recombinant DNA vector that encodes one or more of the polypeptides of the present invention, and culturing the host cell under conditions such that farnesyl benzodiazepinone is produced. The host cell is a prokaryote. In one embodiment, the host cell is an actinomycete. In another embodiment, the host cell is a Streptomyces host cell.     The invention provides recombinant nucleic acids that produce a variety of farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds that cannot be readily synthesized by chemical methodology alone. The invention allows direct manipulation of 046D biosynthetic focus via genetic engineering of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a farnesyl benzodiazepinone according to the invention. The biosynthetic locus is described in Example 11.      Recombinant DNA Vectors Vectors of the invention typically comprise the DNA of a transmissible agent, into which foreign DNA is inserted. A common way to insert one segment of DNA into another segment of DNA involves the use of specific enzymes called restriction enzymes that cleave DNA at specific sites (specific groups of nucleotides) called restriction sites. A "cassette" refers to a DNA coding sequence or segment of DNA that codes for an expression product that can be inserted into a vector at defined restriction sites. The cassette restriction sites are designed to ensure insertion of the cassette in the proper reading frame. Generally, a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a protein useful in the production of a farnesyl benzodiazepinone is inserted at one or more restriction sites of the vector DNA, and then is carried by the vector into a prokaryote e.g. actinomycte, by transformation (see below). A  segment or sequence of DNA having inserted or added DNA, such as an expression vector, can also be called a "DNA construct". A common type of vector is a "plasmid"  which generally is a self-contained molecule of double-stranded DNA, usually of bacterial origin, that can readily accept additional (foreign) DNA and which can be readily introduced into a suitable host cell. A plasmid vector often contains coding DNA and promoter DNA and has one or more restriction sites suitable for inserting foreign DNA. Coding DNA is a DNA sequence that encodes a particular amino acid sequence for a particular protein or enzyme. In one embodiment of the invention, the coding DNA encodes for polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 or 89 that are required for the biosynthesis of a farnesyl benzodiazepinone.      Promoter DNA of a recombinant vector is a DNA sequence that initiates, regulates, or otherwise mediates or controls the expression of the coding DNA.      Promoter DNA and coding may be from the same or different organisms. Recombinant cloning vectors will often include one or more replication systems for cloning or expression, one or more markers for selection in the host, e.g.  antibiotic resistance, and one or more expression cassettes. Vector constructs may be produced using conventional molecular biology and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York (herein "Sambrook et al., 1989"); DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes I and II (D. N. Glover ed. 1985); F. M. Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1994).   Examples of promoters that function in actinomycetes, e.g. Streptomyces, are taught in US Patent Nos. 5,830,695 and 5,466,590. Another example of a transcription promoter useful in Actinomycetes expression vectors is tipA, a promoter inducible by the antibiotic thiostrepton [c.f. Murakami, T., et al., (1989), J.      Bacteriol, 171, 1459].    Transformation of Actinomycetes A suitable transformation method for use with an actinomycete comprises forming the actinomycete culture into spheroplasts using lysozyme. A buffer solution containing recombinant DNA vectors and polyethylene glycol is then added, in order to introduce the vector into the host cells, by using either of the methods of Thompson or Keiser [c. f. Thompson, C. J., et al., (1982), J. Bacteriol., 151, or Keiser, T. et al. (2000), "Practical Streptomyces Genetics", The John lnnes Foundation, Norwich], for example. A thiostrepton-resistance gene is frequently used as a selective marker in the transformation plasrnid [c.f. Hopwood, D. A., et al., (1987), "Methods in Enzymology" 153, 116, Academic Press, New York], but the present invention is not limited thereto. Additional methods for the transformation of actinomycetes are taught in US 5,393,665.      Assay for farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone or biosynthetic intermediates Actinomycetes defective in farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone biosynthesis are transformed with one or more expression vectors encoding one or more proteins in the farnesyl benzodiazepinone biosynthetic pathway, thus restoring farnesyl benzodiazepinone biosynthesis by genetic complementation of the specific defect.     3~05-7PCT-9CA       The presence or absence of farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone or intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway (see Figures 13, 14 and 15) in a recombinant actinomycete can be determined using methodologies that are well known to persons of skill in the art. For example, ethyl acetate extracts of fermentation media used for the culture of a recombinant actinomycete are processed as described in Example 2 and fractions containing farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone or intermediates detected by TLC on commercial Kieselgel 60F25a plates. Farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone and intermediate compounds are visualized by inspection of dried plates under UV light or by spraying the plates with a spray containing vanillin (0.75%) and concentrated sulfuric acid (1.5%, v/v) in ethanol and subsequently heating the plate. The exact identity of the compounds separated by TLC is then determined using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Methods of mass spectroscopy are taught in the published U.S.      Patent Application No. US2003/0052268.      Mutac~enesis The invention allows direct manipulation of 046D biosynthetic locus via genetic engineering of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a farnesyl benzodiazepinone according to the invention.     A number of methods are known in the art that permit the random as well as targeted mutation of the DNA sequences of the invention (see for example, Ausubel et. al. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995) 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). In addition, there are a number of of commercially available kits for site-directed mutagenesis, including both conventional and PCR-based methods. Examples include the E~SITET"' PCR-Based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit available from Stratagene (Catalog No. 200502) and the QUIKCHANGETM Site-directed mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (Catalog No. 200518), and the CHAMELEON~ double-stranded Site-directed mutagenesis kit, also from Stratagene (Catalog No. 200509).   In addition the nucleotides of the invention may be generated by insertional mutation or truncation (N-terminal, internal or C-terminal) according to methodology known to a person skilled in the art.      Older methods of site-directed mutagenesis known in the art rely on sub-cloning of the sequence to be mutated into a vector, such as an M13 bacteriophage vector, that allows the isolation of single-stranded DNA template. In these methods, one anneals a mutagenic primer (i.e., a primer capable of annealing to the site to be mutated but bearing one or more mismatched nucleotides at the site to be mutated) to the single-stranded template and then polymerizes the complement of the template starting from the 3' end of the mutagenic primer. The resulting duplexes are then transformed into host bacteria and plaques are screened for the desired mutation.      More recently, site-directed mutagenesis has employed PCR methodologies, which have the advantage of not requiring a single-stranded template. In addition, methods have been developed that do not require sub-cloning. Several issues must be considered when PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis is performed. First, in these methods it is desirable to reduce the number of PCR cycles to prevent expansion of undesired mutations introduced by the polymerise. Second, a selection must be employed in order to reduce the number of non-mutated parental molecules persisting in the reaction. Third, an extended-length PCR method is preferred in order to allow the use of a single PCR primer set. And fourth, because of the non-template-dependent terminal extension activity of some thermostable polymerises it is often necessary to incorporate an end-polishing step into the procedure prior to blunt-end ligation of the PCR-generated mutant product. The protocol described below accommodates these considerations through the following steps. First, the template concentration used is approximately fold higher than that used in conventional PCR reactions, allowing a reduction in the number of cycles from 25-30 down to 5-10 without dramatically reducing product yield. Second, the restriction endonuclease Dpn I (recognition target sequence: 5-Gm6ATC-3, where the A residue is methylated) is used to select against parental DNA, since most common strains of E. coli Dam methylate their DNA at the sequence 5-GATC-3. Third, Taq Extender is used in the PCR mix in order to increase the proportion of long (i.e., full plasmid length) PCR products.  Finally, Pfu DNA polymerise is used to polish the ends of the PCR product prior to intramolecular ligation using T4 DNA ligase. A non-limiting example for the isolation of mutant polynucleotides is described in detail as follows:      Plasmid template DNA (approximately 0.5 pmole) is added to a PCR cocktail containing: 1x mutagenesis buffer (20 mM Tris HCI, pH 7.5; 8 mM MgCl2;  40~gi'ml BSA); 12-20 pmole of each primer (one of skill in the art may design a mutagenic primer as necessary, giving consideration to those factors such as base composition, primer length and intended buffer salt concentrations that affect the annealing characteristics of oligonucleotide primers; one primer must contain the desired mutation, and one (the same or the other) must contain a 5' phosphate to facilitate later ligation), 250 ~M each dNTP, 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerise, and 2.5 U of Taq Extender (Available from Stratagene; See Nielson et al. (1994) Strategies 7: 27, and U.S. Patent No. 5,556,772). Primers can be prepared using the triester method of Matteucci et al., 1981, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103:3185-3191, incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively automated synthesis may be preferred, for example, on a Biosearch 8700 DNA Synthesizer using cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry.    The PCR cycling is performed as follows: 1 cycle of 4 min at 94oC, 2 min at 50oC and 2 min at 72oC; followed by 5-10 cycles of 1 min at 94oC, 2 min at 54oC and 1 min at 72oC. The parental template DNA and the linear, PCR-generated DNA incorporating the mutagenic primer are treated with Dpnl (10 U) and Pfu DNA polymerise (2.5U). This results in the Dpnl digestion of the in vivo methylated parental template and hybrid DNA and the removal, by Pfu DNA polymerise, of the non-template-directed Taq DNA polymerise-extended bases) on the linear PCR product. The reaction is incubated at 37oC for 30 min and then transferred to 72oC for an additional 30 min. Mutagenesis buffer (115 ul of 1x) containing 0.5 mM  ATP is added to the Dpnl-digested, Pfu DNA polymerise-polished PCR products. The solution is mixed and 10 ul are removed to a new microfuge tube and T4 DNA  ligase (2-4 U) is added. The ligation is incubated for greater than 60 min at 37oC.  Finally, the treated solution is transformed into competent E. coli according to standard methods.     Methods of random mutagenesis, which will result in a panel of mutants bearing one or more randomly situated mutations, exist in the art. Such a panel of mutants may then be screened for those exhibiting reduced uracil detection activity relative to the wild-type polymerise (e.g., by measuring the incorporation of 10nmoles of dNTPs into polymeric form in 30 minutes in the presence of 200~M dUTP and at the optimal temperature for a given DNA polymerise). An example of a method for random mutagenesis is the so-called "error-prone PCR method". As the name implies, the method amplifies a given sequence under conditions in which the DNA polymerise does not support high fidelity incorporation. The conditions encouraging error-prone incorporation for different DNA polymerises vary, however one skilled in the art may determine such conditions for a given enzyme. A key variable for many DNA polymerises in the fidelity of amplification is, for example, the type and concentration of divalent metal ion in the buffer. The use of manganese ion and/or variation of the magnesium or manganese ion concentration may therefore be applied to influence the error rate of the polymerise.      Genes for desired mutant polypeptides generated by mutagenesis may be sequenced to identify the sites and number of mutations. For those mutants comprising more than one mutation, the effect of a given mutation may be evaluated by introduction of the identified mutation to the wild-type gene by site-directed mutagenesis in isolation from the other mutations borne by the particular mutant.      Screening assays of the single mutant thus produced will then allow the determination of the effect of that mutation alone.      V. Genes and proteins for the production of ECO-04601 As discussed in more detail below, the isolated, purified or enriched nucleic acids of one of SEQ I D NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 2 7, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89 may be used to prepare one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 4C, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80,' 82, 84, 86 and 88, respectively, or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 500 or more consecutive amino acids of one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention is an isolated, purified or enriched nucleic acid which encodes one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 or more consecutive amino acids of one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88. The coding sequences of these nucleic acids may be identical to one of the coding sequences of one of the nucleic acids of SEQ I D NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89 or a fragment thereof, or may be different coding sequences which encode one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 consecutive amino acids of one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, ~'34, 86 and 88 as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code. The genetic code is well known to those of skill in the art and can be obtained, for example, from Stryer, Biochemistry, 3rd edition, W. H. Freeman & Co., New York.      The isolated, purified or enriched nucleic acid which encodes one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36. 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 may include, but is not limited to: (1 ) only the coding sequences of one of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89; (2) the coding sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89 and additional coding sequences, such as leader sequences or proprotein; and (3) the coding sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89 and non-coding sequences, such as non-coding sequences 5' and/or 3' of the coding sequence. Thus, as used herein, the term "polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide" encompasses a polynucleotide that includes only coding sequence for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide that includes additional coding and/or non-coding sequence.      The invention relates to polynucleotides based on SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89 but having polynucleotide changes that are "silent", for example changes which do not alter the amino acid sequence encoded by the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89. The invention also relates to polynucleotides which have nucleotide changes which result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions and truncations of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88. Such nucleotide changes may be introduced using techniques such as site directed mutagenesis, random chemical mutagenesis, exonuclease III  deletion, and other recombinant DNA techniques. The isolated, purified or enriched nucleic acids of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89, the sequences complementary thereto, or a fragment comprising at least 100, 150, 200, 300, 400 or more consecutive bases of one of the sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 51, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89, or the sequences complementary thereto may be used as probes to identify and isolate DNAs encoding the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 espectively. In such procedures, a genomic DNA library is constructed from a sample microorganism or a sample containing a microorganism capable of producing a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone.     The genomic DNA library is then contacted with a probe comprising a coding sequence or a fragment of the coding sequence, encoding one of the polypeptides of SEO ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88, or a fragment thereof under conditions which permit the probe to specifically hybridize to sequences complementary thereto. In a preferred embodiment, the probe is an oligonucleotide of about 10 to about 30 nucleotides in length designed based on a nucleic acid of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89. Genomic DNA clones which hybridize to the probe are then detected and isolated. Procedures for preparing and identifying DNA clones of interest are disclosed in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley 503 Sons, Inc. 1997; and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. In another embodiment, the probe is a restriction fragment or a PCR amplified nucleic acid derived from SEQ I D NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89. The isolated, purified or enriched nucleic acids of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89, the sequences complementary thereto, or a fragment comprising at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400 or 500 consecutive bases of one of the sequences of SEQ I D NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89 or the sequences complementary thereto may be used as probes to identify and isolate related nucleic acids. In some embodiments, the related nucleic acids may be genomic DNAs (or cDNAs) from potential farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone producers. In such procedures, a nucleic acid sample containing nucleic acids from a potential farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone producer is contacted with the probe under conditions that permit the probe to specifically hybridize to related sequences. The nucleic acid sample may be a genomic DNA (or cDNA) library from the potential farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producer. Hybridization of the probe to nucleic acids is then detected using any of the methods described above.  Hybridization may be carried out under conditions of low stringency, moderate stringency or high stringency. As an example of nucleic acid hybridization, a polymer membrane containing immobilized denatured nucleic acids is first prehybridized for 30 minutes at 45 °C in a solution consisting of 0.9 M  NaCI, 50 mM     NaH2P04, pH 7.0, 5.0 mM Na2EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10X Denhardt's, and 0.5 mg/ml polyriboadenylic acid. Approximately 2 x 10' cpm (specific activity 4-9 x 10$  cpm/ug) of 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probe are then added to the solution. After hours of incubation, the membrane is washed for 30 minutes at room temperature in 1X SET (150 mM NaCI, 20 mM Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.8, 1 mM Na2EDTA) containing 0.5% SDS, followed by a 30 minute wash in fresh 1X SET at Tm-10°C for the oligonucleotide probe where Tm is the melting temperature. The membrane is then exposed to autoradiographic film for detection of hybridization signals.     By varying the stringency of the hybridization conditions used to identify nucleic acids, such as genomic DNAs or cDNAs, which hybridize to the detectable probe, nucleic acids having different levels of homology to the probe can be identified and isolated. Stringency may be varied by conducting the hybridization at varying temperatures below the melting temperatures of the probes. The melting temperature of the probe may be calculated using the following formulas:      For oligonucleotide probes between 14 and 70 nucleotides in length the melting temperature (Tm) in degrees Celcius may be calculated using the formula: Tm=81.5+16.6(log [Na+]) + 0.41 (fraction G+C)-(600/N) where N is the length of the oligonucleotide.    If the hybridization is carried out in a solution containing formamide, the melting temperature may be calculated using the equation Tm=81.5+16.6(log [Na +]) + 0.41 (fraction G + C)-(0.63% formamide)-(600/N) where N is the length of the probe.     Prehybridization may be carried out in 6X SSC, 5X Denhardt's reagent, 0.5%      SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA or 6X SSC, 5X      Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide. The composition of the SSC and Denhardt's solutions are listed in Sambrook et al., supra. Hybridization is conducted by adding the detectable probe to the hybridization solutions listed above. Where the probe comprises double stranded DNA, it is denatured by incubating at elevated temperatures and quickly cooling before addition to the hybridization solution. It may also be desirable to similarly denature single stranded probes to eliminate or diminish formation of secondary structures or oligomerization~ The filter is contacted with the hybridization solution for a sufficient period of time to allow the probe to hybridize to cDNAs or genomic DNAs containing sequences complementary thereto or homologous thereto. For probes over 200 nucleotides in length, the hybridization may be carried out at 15-25 °C  below the Tm.   For shorter probes, such as oligonucleotide probes, the hybridization may be conducted at 5-10 °C below the Tm. Preferably, the hybridization is conducted in 6X     SSC, for shorter probes. Preferably, the hybridization is conducted in 50% formamide containing solutions, for longer probes. All the foregoing hybridizations would be considered to be examples of hybridization performed under conditions of high stringency. Following hybridization, the filter is washed for at least 15 minutes in 2X  SSC, 0.1 % SDS at room temperature or higher, depending on the desired stringency.  The filter is then washed with 0.1X SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature (again) for minutes to 1 hour. Nucleic acids which have hybridized to the probe are identified by conventional autoradiography and non-radioactive detection methods.      The above procedure may be modified to identify nucleic acids having decreasing levels of homology to the probe sequence. For example, to obtain nucleic acids of decreasing homology to the detectable probe, less stringent conditions may be used. For example, the hybridization temperature may be decreased in increments of 5 °C from 68 °C to 42 °C in a hybridization buffer having a Na+ concentration of approximately 1 M. Following hybridization, the filter may be washed with 2X SSC, 0.5% SDS at the temperature of hybridization. These conditions are considered to be "moderate stringency" conditions above 50°C and "low stringency" conditions below 50°C. A specific example of "moderate stringency" hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 55°C. A specific example of "low stringency" hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 45°C. Alternatively, the hybridization may be carried out in buffers, such as 6X  SSC, containing formamide at a temperature of 42 °C. In this case, the concentration of formamide in the hybridization buffer may be reduced in 5% increments from 50%  to 0% to identify clones having decreasing levels of homology to the probe.  Following hybridization, the filter may be washed with 6X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 50 °C.  These conditions are considered to be "moderate stringency" conditions above 25% formamide and "low stringency" conditions below 25% formamide. A specific example of "moderate stringency" hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 30% formamide. A specific example of "low stringency" hybridization conditions is when the above hybridization is conducted at 10% formamide. Nucleic acids which have hybridized to the probe are identified by conventional autoradiography and non-radioactive detection methods.     The preceding methods may be used to isolate nucleic acids having at least 97%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, or at least 70% sequence identity to a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the sequences of SEQ I D NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89. The isolated nucleic acid may have a coding sequence that is a naturally occurring allelic variant of one of the coding sequences described herein. Such allelic variant may have a substitution, deletion or addition of one or more nucleotides when compared to the nucleic acids of SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87 and 89, or the sequences complementary thereto.  Additionally, the above procedures may be used to isolate nucleic acids which encode polypeptides having at least 99%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80°f0, or at least 70% identity to a polypeptide having the sequence of one of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 consecutive amino acids thereof. Another aspect of the present invention is an isolated or purified polypeptide comprising the sequence of one of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 consecutive amino acids thereof. As discussed herein, such polypeptides may be obtained by inserting a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide into a vector such that the coding sequence is operably linked to a sequence capable of driving the expression of the encoded polypeptide in a suitable host cell. For example, the expression vector may comprise a promoter, a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for modulating expression levels, an origin of replication and a selectable marker.      Promoters suitable for expressing the polypeptide or fragment thereof in bacteria include the E.coli lac or trp promoters, the lacl promoter, the iacZ  promoter, the T3 promoter, the T7 promoter, the gpt promoter, the lambda PR promoter, the lambda P~ promoter, promoters from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and the acid phosphatase promoter. Fungal promoters include the a factor promoter. Eukaryotic promoters include the CMV immediate early promoter, the HSV thymidine kinase promoter, heat shock promoters, the early and late SV40 promoter, LTRs from retroviruses, and the mouse metallothionein-I promoter. Other promoters known to control expression of genes in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses may also be used.      Mammalian expression vectors may also comprise an origin of replication, any necessary ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donors and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5' flanking nontranscribed sequences. In some embodiments, DNA sequences derived from the SV40 splice and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements. Vectors for expressing the polypeptide or fragment thereof in eukaryotic cells may also contain enhancers to increase expression levels. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually from about 10 to about 300 by in length that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin by 100 to 270, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and the adenovirus enhancers.  In addition, the expression vectors preferably contain one or more selectable marker genes to permit selection of host cells containing the vector. Examples of selectable markers that may be used include genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase or genes conferring neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, genes conferring tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in E. coli, and the S.  cerevisiae TRP1 gene.      The appropriate DNA sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, the DNA sequence is ligated to the desired position in the vector following digestion of the insert and the vector with appropriate restriction endonucleases. Alternatively, appropriate restriction enzyme sites can be engineered into a DNA sequence by PCR. A variety of cloning techniques are disclosed in Ausbel et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1997 and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed., Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, 1989. Such procedures and others are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art. The vector may be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, or a phage. Other vectors include derivatives of chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, viruses, bacterial plasmids, phage DNA, baculovirus, yeast plasmids, vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA, viral DNA such as vaccinia, adenovirus, fowl pox virus, and pseudorabies. A  variety of cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989).      Particular bacterial vectors which may be used include the commercially available plasmids comprising genetic elements of the well known cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017), pKK223-3 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden), pGEM1 (Promega Biotec, Madison, WI, USA) pQE70, pQE60, pQE-9 (Qiagen), pD10, phiX174, pBluescriptT"' II KS, pNHBA, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A (Stratagene), ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 (Pharmacia), pKK232-8 and pCM7. Particular eukaryotic vectors include pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1, pSG (Stratagene) pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, and pSVL (Pharmacia). However, any other vector may be used as long as it is replicable and stable in the host cell. The host cell may be any of the host cells familiar to those skilled in the art, including prokaryotic cells or eukaryotic cell s. As representative examples of appropriate hosts, there may be mentioned: bacteria cells, such as E. coli, Streptomyces lividans, Streptomyces griseofuscus, Streptomyces ambofaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus, fungal cells, such as yeast, insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9, animal cells such as CHO, COS or Bowes melanoma, and adenoviruses. The selection of an appropriate host is within the abilities of those skilled in the art.     The vector may be introduced into the host cells using any of a variety of techniques, including electroporation transformation, transfection, transduction, viral infection, gene guns, or Ti-mediated gene transfer. Where appropriate, the engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the genes of the present invention. Following transformation of a suitable host strain and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter may be induced by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction) and the cells may be cultured for an additional period to allow them to produce the desired polypeptide or fragment thereof.      Cells are typically harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract is retained for further purification.    Microbial cells employed for expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art. The expressed polypeptide or fragment thereof can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Protein refolding steps can be used, as necessary, in completing configuration of the polypeptide. If desired, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed for final purification steps.      Various mammalian cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant protein. Examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts (described by Gluzman, Cell, 23:175(1981 )), and other cell lines capable of expressing proteins from a compatible vector, such as the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. The constructs in host cells can be used in a conventional manner to produce the gene product encoded by the recombinant sequence. Polypeptides of the invention may or may not also include an initial methionine amino acid residue. Alternatively, the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, h2, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 consecutive amino acids thereof can be synthetically produced by conventional peptide synthesizers. In other embodiments, fragments or portions of the polynucleotides may be employed for producing the corresponding full-length polypeptide by peptide synthesis; therefore, the fragments may be employed as intermediates for producing the full-length polypeptides.      Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to produce one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 consecutive amino acids thereof using mRNAs transcribed from a DNA construct comprising a promoter operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide or fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the DNA construct may be linearized prior to conducting an in vitro transcription reaction. The transcribed mRNA is then incubated with an appropriate cell-free translation extract, such as a rabbit reticulocyte extract, to produce the desired polypeptide or fragment thereof.   The present invention also relates to variants of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or fragments comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 consecutive amino acids thereof. The term "variant" includes derivatives or analogs of these polypeptides. In particular, the variants may differ in amino acid sequence from the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 by one or more substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions and truncations, which may be present in any combination. The variants may be naturally occurring or created in vitro. In particular, such variants may be created using genetic engineering techniques such as site directed mutagenesis, random chemical mutagenesis, exonuclease III deletion procedures, and standard cloning techniques. Alternatively, such variants, fragments, analogs, or derivatives may be created using chemical synthesis or modification procedures. Other methods of making variants are also familiar to those skilled in the art.     These include procedures in which nucleic acid sequences obtained from natural isolates are modified to generate nucleic acids that encode polypeptides having characteristics which enhance their value in industrial or laboratory applications. In such procedures, a large number of variant sequences having one or more nucleotide differences with respect to the sequence obtained from the natural isolate are generated and characterized. Preferably, these nucleotide differences result in amino acid changes with respect to the polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acids from the natural isolates.    The variants of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, b0, 62, 65, 679 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 may be variants in which one or more of the amino acid residues of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code.   Conservative substitutions are those that substitute a given amino acid in a polypeptide by another amino acid of like characteristics. Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the following replacements: replacements of an aliphatic amino acid such as Ala, Val, Leu and Ile with another aliphatic amino acid; replacement of a Ser with a Thr or vice versa; replacement of an acidic residue such as Asp or Glu with another acidic residue; replacement of a residue bearing an amide group, such as Asn or Gln, with another residue bearing an amide group; exchange of a basic residue such as Lys or Arg with another basic residue; and replacement of an aromatic residue such as Phe or Tyr with another aromatic residue.    Other variants are those in which one or more of the amino acid residues of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 include a substituent group. Still other variants are those in which the polypeptide is associated with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol). Additional variants are those in which additional amino acids are fused to the polypeptide, such as leader sequence, a secretory sequence, a proprotein sequence or a sequence that facilitates purification, enrichment, or stabilization of the polypeptide.      In some embodiments, the fragments, derivatives and analogs retain the same biological function or activity as the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88. In other embodiments, the fragment, derivative or analogue includes a fused heterologous sequence that facilitates purification, enrichment, detection, stabilization or secretion of the polypeptide that can be enzymatically cleaved, in whole or in part, away from the fragment, derivative or analogue.  Another aspect of the present invention are polypeptides or fragments thereof which have at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or more than 95% identity to one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 50, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or a fragment comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 consecutive amino acids thereof. It will be appreciated that amino acid "substantially identity" includes conservative substitutions such as those described above.    The polypeptides or fragments having homology to one of the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 or a fragment comprising at least 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 consecutive amino acids thereof may be obtained by isolating the nucleic acids encoding them using the techniques described above.      Alternatively, the homologous polypeptides or fragments may be obtained through biochemical enrichment or purification procedures.

In another embodiment, the unit dosage form of the compound can be a solution of the compound or a salt thereof in a suitable diluent in sterile, hermetically sealed ampoules.      The amount of the compound of the present invention in a unit dosage comprises a therapeutically-effective amount of at least one active compound of the present invention which may vary depending on the recipient subject, route and frequency of administration. A recipient subject refers to a plant, a cell culture or an animal such as an ovine or a mammal including a human.      According to this aspect of the present invention, the novel compositions disclosed herein are placed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and are delivered to a recipient subject (including a human subject) in accordance with known methods of drug delivery. In general, the methods of the invention for delivering the compositions of the invention in vivo utilize art-recognized protocols for delivering the agent with the only substantial procedural modification being the substitution of the compounds of the present invention for the drugs in the art-recognized protocols.  Likewise, the methods for using the claimed composition for treating cells in culture, for example, to eliminate or reduce the level of bacterial contamination of a cell culture, utilize art-recognized protocols for treating cell cultures with antibacterial agents) with the only substantial procedural modification being the substitution of the compounds of the present invention for the agents used in the art-recognized protocols.      The compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating bacterial infections, pre-cancerous or cancerous conditions, and acute or chronic inflammatory disease. As used herein, the term "unit dosage" refers to a quantity of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention that elicits a desired therapeutic response. As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound of the present invention that prevents the onset, alleviates the symptoms, or stops the progression of a bacterial infection, inflammatory condition, or pre-cancerous or cancerous condition.  The term "treating" is defined as administering, to a subject, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of the present invention, both to prevent the occurrence of a bacterial infection, inflammation or pre-cancer or cancer condition, or to control or eliminate a bacterial infection, inflammation or pre-cancer or cancer condition. The term "desired therapeutic response" refers to treating a recipient subject with a compound of the present invention such that a bacterial or inflammatory condition or pre-cancer or cancer condition is reversed, arrested or prevented in a recipient subject.      The compounds of the present invention can be administered as a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. The treatment regime may require administration over extended periods of time, e.g., for several days or for from two to four weeks. The amount per administered dose or the total amount administered will depend on such factors as the nature and severity of the disease condition, the age and general health of the recipient subject, the tolerance of the recipient subject to the compound and the type of the bacterial infection, inflammatory disorder, or type of cancer.    A compound according to this invention may also be administered in the diet or feed of a patient or animal. The diet for animals can be normal foodstuffs to which the compound can be added or it can be added to a premix.      The compounds of the present invention may be taken in combination, together or separately with any known clinically approved antibiotic, inflammation or anti-cancer agent to treat a recipient subject in need of such treatment.      VII. Method of Inhibiting Tumor Growth In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting tumor growth. Compounds as described herein can possess antitumor activity.  The compounds are effective against mammalian tumor cells such as leukemia cells, melanoma cells, breast carcinoma cells, lung carcinoma cells, pancreatic carcinoma cells, ovarian carcinoma cells, renal carcinoma cells, colon carcinoma cells prostate carcinoma cells and glioma cells. The antitumor method of the invention results in inhibition of tumor cells. The term "inhibition", when used in conjunction with the antitumor method refers to suppression, killing, stasis, or destruction of tumor cells. The antitumor method preferably results in prevention, reduction or elimination of invasive activity and related metastasis of tumor cells. The term "effective amount" when used in conjunction with the antitumor cell method refers to the amount of the compound sufficient to result in the inhibition of mammalian tumor cells.      The inhibition of mammalian tumor growth according to this method can be monitored in several ways. First, tumor cells grown in vitro can be treated with the compound and monitored for growth or death relative to the same cells cultured in the absence of the compound. A cessation of growth or a slowing of the growth rate (i.e., the doubling rate), e.g., by 10% or more, is indicative of tumor cell inhibition. Alternatively, tumor cell inhibition can be monitored by administering the compound to an animal model of the tumor of interest. Examples of experimental animal tumor models are known in the art and described in the examples herein. A cessation of tumor growth (i.e., no further increase in size) or a reduction in tumor size (i.e., tumor volume) or cell number (e.g., at least a 10% decrease in either) in animals treated with a compound as described herein relative to tumors in control animals not treated with the compound is indicative of tumor growth inhibition.     To monitor the efficacy of tumor treatment in a human, tumor size or tumor cell titer is measured before and after initiation of the treatment, and treatment is considered effective if either the tumor size or titer ceases further growth, or if the tumor is reduced in size or titer, e.g., by at least 10% or more (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or even 100%, that is, the absence of the tumor). Methods of determining the size or cell titer of a tumor in vivo vary with the type of tumor, and include, for example, various imaging techniques well known to those in the medical imaging or oncology fields (MRI, CAT, PET, etc.), as well as histological techniques and flow cytometry.     For the antitumor method of the invention, a typical effective dose of the compounds given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about mg/kg of body weight of the subject.      VIII. Method of Inhibiting Lipoxyaenase In another embodiment, the present invention also provides for a method of treating diseased states, in particular inflammation, caused by the 5-lipoxygenase system and/or by the synthesis of the Leukotrienes C4, D4, E4 and F4 as well as Leukotriene B4 in mammals, especially in human subjects. This method comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of ECO-04601. Compound ECO-04601 may be used alone or in combination with other anti-inflammatory compounds to treat or prevent disease states related to inflammation including pulmonary conditions, inflammation, cardiovascular conditions, central nervous system conditions or skin conditions. More specific diseases include gastritis;  erosive esophagitis; inflammatory bowel disease; ethanol-induced hemorrhagic erosions; hepatic ischemia; ischemic neuronal injury; noxious agent induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, neuronal or myocardial tissue; liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CC14 and D-galactosamine; ischemic renal failure; disease-induced hepatic damage; trauma-or stress-induced cell damage; asthma; multiple sclerosis; ischemic reperfusion; edema; rheumatoid arthritis; viral encephalitis; bacterial pneumonia; neurodegeneration; Alzheimer's disease and glycerol-induced renal failure.    For the method of the invention related to the 5-lipoxygenase system and/or the biosynthesis of Leukotrienes, a typical effective unit dose of ECO-04601 given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight of the subject.      The inhibition of lipoxygenase enzymes is monitored using methods well known in the art and as described in the examples herein. A decrease in enzyme activity by at least 10%, relative to the activity in the absence of a compound as described herein is indicative of effective inhibition of lipoxygenase activity.      Farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds useful according to the invention can be used to reduce or prevent inflammation. Among the hallmarks of local acute inflammation are heat, redness, swelling, pain and loss of function. These changes are induced largely by changes in vascular flow and caliber, changes in vascular permeability and leukocyte exudation (Bobbins et al., "Pathologic Basis of Disease", 6'" Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA). Anti-inflammatory therapy performed using compounds useful according to the invention can be monitored for success by tracking any of these changes. For example, a decrease in swelling (e.g., at least 10% decrease following treatment) or reported pain (e.g., a sustained decrease of 1 point or more on a 1-10 scale reported by the patient, with 10 being the worst pain experienced in association with this disorder prior to treatment, and 0 being no pain) can be used to indicate successful treatment.  Other measurable hallmarks of inflammation include leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory cytokine levels. These hallmarks can be monitored by biopsy of the affected tissue. A decrease of 10% or more in leukocyte infiltration in fixed, stained tissue relative to infiltration in similar tissue prior to treatment can be used to indicate successful treatment, as can a decrease of 10% or more in the level of any given inflammatory cytokine, relative to the level before treatment. Those skilled in the art can readily assay for inflammatory cytokine levels in tissue, blood, or other fluid samples. Alternatively, the level of systemic indicators of inflammation such as C reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be monitored.  Each of these has established normal ranges in medicine, and treatment is considered successful if one or more of such indicators goes from outside the normal range to inside the normal range after the initiation of treatment.      IX. Method of Inhibitina Bacterial Growth In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for treating bacterial infection in a mammalian subject in need thereof, comprising the step of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of compound ECO-0~601, a compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prod rug thereof.     According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of decreasing bacterial quantity in a biological sample. This method comprises the step of contacting the biological sample with a compound ECO-04601, a compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prodrug thereof. This method is effective if the number of bacteria decreases by at least 10%, and preferably more, e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% or even 100% after contacting the biological sample with compound ECO-04601, a compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prod rug thereof.    These pharmaceutical compositions effective to treat or prevent a bacterial infection which comprise ECO-04601, a compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prodrug thereof in an amount sufficient to measurably decrease bacterial quantity, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, are another embodiment of the present invention. The term "measurably decrease bacterial quantity", as used herein means a measurable change in the number of bacteria between a sample containing the inhibitor and a sample not containing the inhibitor. Agents which increase the susceptibility of bacterial organisms to antibiotics are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,288, U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,561 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,306 describe methods of using bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) for increasing antibiotic susceptibility of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Agents that increase the permeability of the outer membrane of bacterial organisms have been described by Vaara, M. in Microbiological Reviews (1992) pp. 395-411, and the sensitization of gram-negative bacteria has been described by Tsubery, H., et al, in J. Med. Chem . (2000) pp. 3085-3092.      For the method of the invention related to treatment of subjects with a bacterial infection, a typical effective unit dose of ECO-04601, a compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prod rug thereof given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight of the subject.      Another preferred embodiment of this invention relates to a method, as described above, of treating a bacterial infection in a mammal in need thereof, but further comprising the step of administering to the mammal an agent which increases the susceptibility of bacterial organisms to antibiotics.    According to another preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method, as described above, of decreasing bacterial quantity in a biological sample, but further comprising the step of contacting the biological sample with an agent which increases the susceptibility of bacterial organisms to antibiotics.      Methods of decreasing bacterial quantity are effective if the number of bacteria decreases at least 10%, and preferably more, e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% or even 100% after contacting the biological sample with compound ECO-04601, a compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prod rug thereof.   The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of this invention will be useful generally for controlling bacterial infections in vivo. Examples of bacterial organisms that may be controlled by the compositions and methods of this invention include, but are not limited to the following organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyrogenes, Enterococcus fecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Serratia marcesens, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Haemophilus infuenzae, Bacillus anthracis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The compositions and methods will therefore be useful for controlling, treating or reducing the advancement, severity or effects of nosocomial or non-nosocomial infections. Examples of nosocomial uses include, but are not limited to, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, surgical wound infections, bacteremia and therapy for febrile neutropenic patients. Examples of non-nosocomial uses include but are not limited to urinary tract infections, pneumonia, prostatitis, skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections.    In addition to the compounds of this invention, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prod rugs of the compounds of this invention may also be employed in compositions to treat or prevent the above-identified disorders.      A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prod rug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored derivatives or prod rugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.      Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of this invention include, without limitation, esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters.  Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, IC5o and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the present specification and attached claims are approximations. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant figures and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set in the examples, Tables and Figures are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values may inherently contain certain errors resulting from variations in experiments, testing measurements, statistical analyses and such.  Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.      FX~4MP1 F     EXAMPLE 1: PREPARATION OF PRODUCTION CULTURE lJnless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), (Aldrich). Micromonospora spp. (deposit accession number IDAC 070303-01 ) was maintained on agar plates of ISP2 agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). An inoculum for the production phase was prepared by transferring the surface growth of the Micromonospora spp. from the agar plates to 125-mL  flasks containing 25 mL of sterile medium comprised of 24 g potato dextrin, 3 g beef extract, 5 g Bacto-casitone, 5 g glucose, 5 g yeast extract, and 4 g CaC03 made up to one liter with distilled water (pH 7.0). The culture was incubated at about 28°C for approximately 60 hours on a rotary shaker set at 250 rpm. Following incubation, 10 mL of culture was transferred to a 2L baffled flask containing 500 mL of sterile production medium containing 20 g/L potato dextrin, 20 g/L glycerol, 10 g/L  Fish meal, 5 g/L Bacto-peptone, 2 g/L CaC03, and 2 g/L (NH4)2S04, pH 7Ø Fermentation broth was prepared by incubating the production culture at 28°C in a rotary shaker set at 250 rpm for one week.      EXAMPLE 2: ISOLATION 500 mL ethyl acetate was added to 500 mL of fermentation broth prepared as described in Example 1 above. The mixture was agitated for 30 minutes on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm to create an emulsion. The phases were separated by centrifugation and decantation. Between 4 and 5 g of anhydrous MgS04 was added to the organic phase, which was then filtered and the solvents removed in vacuo.      An ethyl acetate extract from 2 L fermentation was mixed with HP-20 resin (100 mL; Mitsubishi Casei Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in water (300 mL). Ethyl acetate was removed in vacuo, the resin was filtered on a Buchner funnel and the filtrate was discarded. The adsorbed HP-20 resin was then washed successively with 2 x 125 mL of 50% acetonitrile in water, 2X125 mL of 75% acetonitrile in water and 125 mL of acetonitrile.     Fractions containing the compound of Formula II were evaporated to dryness and 100 mg was digested in the 5 mL of the upper phase of a mixture prepared from chloroform, cyclohexane, methanol, and water in the ratios, by volume, of 5:2:10:5.  The sample was subjected to centrifugal partition chromatography using a High Speed Countercurrent (HSCC) system (Kromaton Technologies, Angers, France) fitted with a 200 mL cartridge and prepacked with the upper phase of this two-phase system. The HSCC was run with the lower phase mobile and the compound of Formula II was eluted at approximately one-half column volume. Fractions were collected and the compound of Formula II was detected by TLC of aliquots of the fractions on commercial Kieselgel 60F25a plates. Compound could be visualized by inspection of dried plates under UV light or by spraying the plates with a spray containing vanillin (0.75%) and concentrated sulfuric acid (1.5%, v/v) in ethanol and subsequently heating the plate. Fractions contained substantially pure compound of Formula II, although highly colored. A buff-colored sample could be obtained by chromatography on HPLC as follows. 6 mg of sample was dissolved in acetonitrile and injected onto a preparative HPLC column (XTerra ODS (10ym), 19x150mm, Waters Co., Milford, MA), with a 9 mL/min flow rate and UV peak detection at 300 nm. The column was eluted with acetonitrile/buffer (20 mM of NH4HC03) according to the following gradient shown in Table 1.      Table 1 Time min        Water %          Acetonit_rile 5                95 i Fractions containing the compound of Formula II eluted at approximately 11:0 min and were combined, concentrated and lyophilized to give a yield of 3.8 mg compound.      Alternative Protocol 1 The compound of Formula II was also isolated using the following alternative protocol. At the end of the incubation period, the fermentation broth from the baffled flasks of Example 1 was centrifuged and the supernatant decanted from the pellet containing the bacterial mycelia. 100 mL of 100% MeOH was added to the mycelial pellet and the sample was stirred for 10 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes.     The methanolic supernatant was decanted and saved. 100 mL of acetone was then added to the mycelial pellet and stirred for 10 minutes then centrifuged for minutes. The acetonic supernatant was decanted and combined with the methanolic supernatant. Finally, 100 mL of 20% MeOH/H20 was added to the mycelial pellet, stirred for 10 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes. The supernatant was combined with the acetonic and methanolic supernatants.     The combined supernatant was added to 400 ml of HP-20 resin in 1000 rnL of water and the organics were removed in vacuo. The resulting slurry was filtered on a Buchner funnel and the filtrate was discarded. Adsorbed HP-20 resin was washed successively with 2x500mL of 50% MeOH/H20, 2x500mL of 75% MeOH/H20 and 2x500mL of MeOH.      The individual washes were collected separately and analyzed by TLC as described above. Those fractions containing the compound of Formula II were evaporated to near dryness and lyophilized. The lyophilizate was dissolved in methanol and injected onto a preparative HPLC column (Xterra ODS (10~m), 19x150mm, Waters Co., Milford, MA) with a flow rate of 9 mL/min and peak detection at 300 nm.    The column was eluted with acetonitrile/buffer (5 mM of NH4HC03) according to gradient shown in Table 2.      Table 2 i Time min      Buffer %        Acetonitrile Fractions containing the compound of Formula II were combined, concentrated and lyophilized to yield about 33.7 mg of compound.      Alternative Protocol 2 liters of the whole broth from Example 1 are extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate and the two extracts are combined and concentrated to dryness. The dried extract is weighed, and for every gram of dry extract, 100 mL of MeOH-H20 (2:1 v/v) and 100 mL of hexane is added. The mixture is swirled gently but well to achieve dissolution. The two layers are separated and the aqueous layer is washed with 100 mL of hexane. The two hexane layers are combined and the combined hexane solution is washed with 100 mL methanol:water (2:1, v/v). The two methanol:water layers are combined and treated with 200 mL of EtOAc and mL of water. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice more with 200 mL portions of EtOAc. The EtOAc layers are combined and concentrated. The residue obtained will be suitable for final purification, either by HSCC or by HPLC as described above. This extraction process achieves a ten-fold purification when compared with the extraction protocol used above.      EXAMPLE 3: ELUCIDATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF COMPOUND OF      FORMULA II.     The structure of the compound of Formula II was derived from spectroscopic data, including mass, UV, and NMR spectroscopy. Mass was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry to be 462.6 (FIGURE 1 ), UVmax 230nm with a shoulder at 290 nm (FIGURE 2). NMR data were collected dissolved in MeOH-d4 including proton (FIGURE 3), and multidimensional pulse sequences gDQCOSY (FIGURE 4), gHSQC (FIGURE 5), gHMBC (FIGURE 6), and NOESY (FIGURE 7).      A number of cross peaks in the 2D spectra of ECO-04601 are key in the structural determination. For example, the farnesyl chain is placed on the amide nitrogen by a strong cross peak between the proton signal of the terminal methylene of that chain at 4.52 ppm and the amide carbonyl carbon at 170 ppm in the gHMBC experiment. This conclusion is confirmed by a cross peak in the NOESY spectrum between the same methylene signals at 4.52 ppm and the aromatic proton signal at 6.25 ppm from one of the two protons of the tetra substituted benzenoid ring.      Based on the mass, UV and NMR spectroscopy data, the structure of the compound was determined to be the structure of Formula II.      EXAMPLE 4: ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY (MINIMAL INHIBITORY      CONCENTRATION DETERMINATION) Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits more than 99% of the bacterial population. The MIC determination of ECO-04601 against bacteria strains (Bacillus subtilis - ATCC 23857;  Micrococcus luteus - ATCC 9341 ) was performed using broth microdilution assay (Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically;    Approved Standard-Fifth Edition. NCCLS document M7-A5 (ISBN 1-56238-394-9).      NCCLS, 940 West Valley Road, Suite 1400, Wayne, Pennsylvania 19087-1898 USA.). Test compound preparation: The test article ECO-04601 is prepared as 100X  stock solutions in DMSO, with concentrations ranging from 3.2 mg/ml to 0.0625 mg/ml (a two-fold dilution series over 10 points). The first dilution (3.2mg/ml) was prepared by resuspending 0.5 mg of each test article in 156.25,u1 of DMSO. The stock is then serially diluted by two-fold decrement to obtain the desired concentration range. Inoculum preparation: From an overnight culture in Mueller Hinton (MH) broth, cell density for each indicator strain (Bacillus subtilis; Micrococcus luteus) was adjusted to 0.5 Mc Farland units in 0.85% saline, then further diluted 1/100 in appropriate assay medium (~ 1 X 106 cells/ml).     MIC determination: The 100X ECO-04601 solutions was diluted 50 times in MH broth and dispensed in a 96 well plate, one test concentration per column of wells, columns in total. The 11t" column of wells contained MH broth with 1% DMSO, the 12'" column of wells contained 100,u1 of broth alone. 50 ~I of the final cell dilution of each indicator strain was added to each corresponding well of the microplate containing 50 ~I of diluted drug or media alone. Assay plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hrs.      The results of the MIC for the compound of ECO-04601, shown in Table 3, demonstrate a range of antibacterial effects:     Table 3 Indicator strain MIC (~g/mL) Bacillus subtilis ATCC 23857 12.5 Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 6.25 EXAMPLE 5. ANTICANCER ACTIVITY IN VITRO AGAINST HUMAN AND ANIMAL      TUMOR CELL LINES FROM VARIOUS TISSUES Culture conditions: The cell lines listed in Table 4 were used to characterize the cytotoxicity of ECO-04601 against human and animal tumor cell lines. These cell lines were shown to be free of mycoplasma infection and were maintained on the appropriate media (Table 4) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin, under 5% C02 at 37°C. Cells were passaged twice to three times per week. Viability was examined by staining with 0.25%  trypan blue and only flasks where cell viability was >95% were used for this study. Cell lines amplification and plating: Tumor cells were seeded (1-3 x 103 cells per 100 pL) in 96-wells flat bottom microtiter plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% COZ for 16 hrs before treatment in drug-free medium supplemented with 10% serum. Evaluation of inhibitory activity on cell proliferation: Cells were incubated for 96 hrs with 6 loglo-fold concentrations of the test substance starting at 10pg/ml (20 pM;P. The test substance stock solution (5 mg/mL) was initially diluted at 1/70 fold in medium supplemented with serum. Other concentrations were then obtained from 1/10fold successive dilutions in the same supplemented medium. Cell survival vvas evaluated 96 h later by replacing the culture media with 150 pL fresh medium containing 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH  7.4. Next, 50 pL of 2.5 mg/mL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, was added. After 3-4h of incubation at 37°C, the medium and soluble MTT was removed, and 200 pL  of dimethylsulfoxide was added to dissolve the precipitate of reduced MTT  followed by addition of 25 pL glycine buffer (0.1 M glycine plus 0.1 M NaCI, pH 10.5). The absorbance was determined at 570 nm with a microplate reader. Results were expressed as the concentration of drug which inhibits 50% of the cell growth (IC~o).     The IC~o values shown in Table 4 demonstrated a pharmacologically relevant cytotoxic activity of ECO-04601 against a variety of tumor types such as leukemias, melanomas, pancreatic and breast carcinomas.

ANTICANCER ACTIVITY IN VITRO AGAINST VARIOUS HUMAN      TUMOR CELL LINES FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE PANEL      A study measuring the in vitro antitumor activity of ECO-04601 was performed by the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) against panel of human cancer cell lines in order to determine the ECO-04601 concentrations needed to obtain a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (Gl5o). The operation of this unique screen utilizes 50 different human tumor cell lines, representing leukemia, melanoma and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and kidney.     Culture conditions and plating:        The human tumor cell lines of the cancer-screening panel were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, cells were inoculated into 96 well microtiter plates in 100 ~L at plating densities ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines (Table 5). After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% C02, 95% air and 100% relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. After 24 h, two plates of each cell line were fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz).      Evaluation of inhibitory activity on cell proliferation:     ECO-04601 was provided as a lyophilized powder with an estimated purity of 90+%. The compound was stored at -20°C until day of use. ECO-04601 was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate was thawed and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50pg/mL gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold or'/2 log serial dilutions were made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control. Aliquots of 100 pl of these different drug dilutions were added to the appropriate microtiter wells already containing 100 ~I of medium, resulting in the required final drug concentrations (8.0 x 10-5 M to 8.0 x 10-9 M).   Following drug addition, the plates were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37°C, 5°/~ COz, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay was terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells were fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 pl of cold 50% (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10% TCA) and incubated for 60 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were discarded, and the plates were washed five times with tap water and air-dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100 pl) at 0.4% (w/v) in 1 % acetic acid was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye was removed by washing five times with 1 % acetic acid and the plates were air-dried.      Bound stain was subsequently solubilized with 10 mM trizma base, and the absorbance was read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm.  For suspension cells, the methodology was the same except that the assay was terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 pl of 80% TCA (final concentration, 16% TCA).      The growth inhibitory activity of ECO-04601 was measured by NCI utilizing the Gl5o value, rather than the classical IC5o value. The GlSO value emphasizes the correction for the cell count at time zero and, using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Tz), control growth, (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], Gl5o is calculated as [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] x 100 = -50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net protein 'increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation.      Result:      ECO-04601 shows a significant antitumor activity against several types of tumor as revealed by the NCI screening. Results of the screen are shown in Table 5, and more detailed results of activity against gliomas are shown in Example 7 (Table 6).

EXAMPLE 7: IN VITRO ANTIPROLIFERATIVE STUDY AGAINST A PANEL OF      GLIOMA CELL LINES     The anticancer activity of ECO-04601 was evaluated using a panel of glioma cancer cell lines shown in Table 6, and the 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (IC5o) was determined.      Culture conditions: The cell lines listed in Table 6 were shown to be free of mycoplasma infection and were maintained on DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin, under 5% C02 at 37°C. Cells were passaged once a week. Prior to use the cells were detached from the culture flask by treating with trypsin for five to ten minutes. The cells were counted with a Neubauer glass slide and viability assessed by 0.25% trypan blue exclusion.  Only flasks with >95% cell viability, were used in the study.      Cell lines amplification and plating:     Cells, 5 x 103 cells per well in 100 pL drug-free medium supplemented with 10% serum, were plated in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates and incubated at 37°C for 48 hrs before treatment.      Evaluation of inhibitory activity on cell proliferation:      Cells (in triplicate wells) were incubated 96 hrs with medium containing different concentrations of ECO-04601, starting at 5.0 pg/ml (10 pM). The compound was used in a solution of 1 % DMSO in D-MEM or RPMI media (or other equivalent media). The concentrations of ECO-04601 were as follows: 10 pM (5.0 pg/ml), 1 pM (0.50 pg/ml), 0.5 pM (0.25 pg/ml), 0.1 pM (0.050 pg/ml), 0.5 pM (0.025 pg/ml), 0.01 pM (0.0050 pg/ml), 0.001 pM (0.00050 pg/ml). Negative controls were cells treated with vehicle alone (1 % DMSO in culture medium). Positive controls were cells treated with 4 to 6 increasing concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP) (data not shown). The optical density was measured before incubation (time 0) and following 96 hrs of incubation with test compound in order to measure the growth rate of each cell line. At the end of the cell treatment, cell culture media was replaced with 150 pl of fresh medium containing 10 mM of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.4. Then 50 pl of 2.5 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in PBS pH 7.4, were added to each well and the culture plates incubated for 4 hrs at 37°C. The resulting supernatant was removed and formazan crystals were dissolved with 200 pl of DMSO followed by 25 pl of glycine buffer (0.1 M glycine plus 0.1 M NaCI, pH 10.5). The optical density was read in each well using a single wavelength spectrophotometer plate reader at 570 nm. Results were expressed as the concentration of drug, which inhibits 50% of the cell growth (IC5o). Each of the cell lines was tested in at least 3 independent experiments.      Results shown in Table 6 confirmed the activity of ECO-04601 against different brain cancer cell lines including gliosarcoma, which is the most malignant form of type IV glioblastoma multiform. Gliosarcomas are a mixture of glial and endothelial cells and are resistant to any chemotherapy.

Eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid by the action of lipoxygenases or cycloxygenases have been found to be involved in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (i.e. asthma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia, edema) as well in neurodegeneration (Alzheimer disease), aging and various steps of carcinogenesis, including tumor promotion, progression and metastasis.     The aim of this study was to determine whether ECO-04601, is able to block the formation of leukotrienes by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of human 5-LO.    Methods employed are based on Carter et al (1991 ) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 256(3):929-937, and Safayhi (2000), Planta Medica 66:110-113 which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.      Experimental Design:      Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNs) were isolated through a Ficoll-Paque density gradient. PMNs were stimulated by addition A23187 (30 pM final concentration). Stimulated PMNs were adjusted to a density of 5 x106 cells/mL in HBBS medium and incubated with the vehicle control (DMSO), ECO-04601 (at final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 pM) and NDGA as positive control (at final concentrations of 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.03 pM) for 15 minutes at 37°C.      Following incubation, samples were neutralized with NaOH and centrifuged.      Leukotriene B4 content was measured in the supernatant using an Enzyme Immunosorbant Assay (EIA) assay.   Results:   Results shown in Figure 8 demonstrated that ECO-04601 inhibited the activity of human 5-LO with an apparent ICSO = 0.93 pM (versus 0.1 NM for the positive control NDGA) and therefore displays anti-inflammatory properties. EXAMPLE 9: IN VIVD EFFICACY IN A GLIOMA MODEL      The aim of this study was to test whether ECO-04601 administered by i.p. route prevents or delays tumor growth in C6 glioblastoma cell-bearing mice, and to determine an effective dosage regimen.      Animalc~      A total of 60 six-week-old female mice (Mus musculus nude mice), ranging between 18 to 25 g in weight, were observed for 7 days before treatment.  Animal experiments were performed according to ethical guidelines of animal experimentation (Charte du comite d'ethique du CNRS, juillet 2003) and the English guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia (WORKMAN, P., TWENTYMAN, P., BALKWILL, F., et al. (1998). United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) Guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia (Second Edition, July 1997; British Journal of Cancer 77:1-10). Any dead or apparently sick mice were promptly removed and replaced with healthy mice. Sick mice were euthanized upon removal from the cage. Animals were maintained in rooms under controlled conditions of temperature (23~2°C), humidity (45~5%), photoperiodicity (12 hrs light / 12 hrs dark) and air exchange.  Animals were housed in polycarbonate cages (5/single cage) that were equipped to provide food and water. Animal bedding consisted of sterile wood shavings that were replaced every other day. Food was provided ad libitum, being placed in the metal lid on the top of the cage. Autoclaved tap water was provided ad libitum. Water bottles were equipped with rubber stoppers and sipper tubes. Water bottles were cleaned, sterilized and replaced once a week. Two different numbers engraved on two earrings identified the animals. Each cage was labelled with a specific code.      Tumor Cell Line:      The C6 cell line was cloned from a rat glial tumor induced by N-nitrosomethyurea (NMU) by Premont et al.

Biochim Biophys Acta. 1975 Feb 13;381 (2):368-76.) after series of alternate culture and animal passages.      Cells were grown as adherent monolayers at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (5% COz, 95% air). The culture medium was DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. For experimental use, tumor cells were detached from the culture flask by a 10 min treatment with trypsin-versen. The cells were counted in a hemocytometer and their viability assessed by 0.25%  trypan blue exclusion.      Preparation of the Test Article:  For the test article, the following procedure was followed for reconstitution (performed immediately preceding injection). The vehicle consisted of a mixture of benzyl alcohol (1.5%), ethanol (8.5%), propylene glycol (27%), PEG 400 (27%), _79_ dimethylacetamide (6%) and water (30%). The vehicle solution was first vortexed in order to obtain a homogeneous liquid. 0.6 mL of the vortexed vehicle solution was added to each vial containing the test article (ECO-04601 ). Vials were mixed thoroughly by vortexing for 1 minute and inverted and shaken vigorously. Vials were mixed again prior to injection into each animal.      Animal Inoculation with tumor cells:      Experiment started at day 0 (Do). On Do, mice received a superficial intramuscular injection of C6 tumor cells (5 x 105 cells) in 0.1 mL of DMEM  complete medium into the upper right posterior leg.      Treatment regimen and Results: In a first series of experiments, treatment started 24 hrs following inoculation of C6 cells. On the day of the treatment, each mouse was slowly injected with pL of test or control articles by i.p. route. For all groups, treatment was performed until the tumor volume of the saline-treated mice (group 1 ) reached approximately 3 crra3 (around day 16). Mice of group 1 were treated daily with a saline isosmotic solution for 16 days. Mice of group 2 were treated daily with the vehicle solution for 16 days. Mice of group 3 were treated daily with 10 mg/kg of ECO-04601 for 16 days. Mice of group 3 were treated every two days with 30 mg/kg of ECO-04601 and received 8 treatments. Mice of group 5 were treated every three days with 30 mg/kg of ECO-04601 and received 6 treatments. Measurement of tumor volume started as soon as tumors became palpable (>100 mm3; around day 11 post-inoculation) and was evaluated every second day until the end of the treatment using callipers.  As shown in Table 7 and Figure 9, the mean value of the tumor volume of all ECO-04601 treated groups (6 mice/group) was significantly reduced as demonstrated by the one-way analysis of variance (Anova) test followed by the non-parametric Dunnett's multiple comparison test comparing treated groups to the saline group.

On the day of the treatment, each mouse was slowly injected with 100 pL of ECO-04601 by i.p. route. Mice of group 1 were treated daily with saline isosmotic solution. Mice of group 2 were treated daily with the vehicle solution. Mice of group 3 were treated daily with 20 mg/kg of ECO-04601. Mice of group 4 were treated daily with 30 mg/kg of ECO-04601. Mice were treated until the tumor volume of the saline-treated control mice (group 1 ) reached around 4 cm3. Tumor volume was measured every second day until the end of the treatment using callipers. As shown in Table 8 and Figure 70, the mean value of the tumor volume of all ECO-04601 treated groups (6 mice/group) was significantly reduced as demonstrated by the one-way analysis of variance (Anova) test followed by the non-parametric Dunnett's multiple comparison test comparing treated groups to the saline group. An asterisk in the P value column of Table 8 indicates a statistically significant value, while "ns" signifies not statistically significant.      Histological analysis of tumor sections showed pronounced morphological changes between ECO-04601-treated tumors and control groups. In tumors treated with ECO-04601 (20 - 30 mg/kg), cell density was decreased and the nuclei of remaining tumor cells appeared larger and pycnotic while no such changes were observed for vehicle-treated mice (Figure 11 ).

General principles of organic chemistry required for making and manipulating the compounds described herein, including functional moieties, reactivity and common protocols are described, for example, in "Advanced Organic Chemistry," 3~d Edition by Jerry March (1985) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the synthetic methods described herein may use a variety of protecting groups, whether or not they are explicitly described. A "protecting group" as used herein means a moiety used to block one or more functional moieties such as reactive groups including oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, so that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a polyfunctional compound. General principles for the use of protective groups, their applicability to specific functional groups and their uses are described for example in T. H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, lVew York (1999).     Scheme 1: Epoxide variants The epoxide compounds of the present invention (e.g., compounds according to exemplary Formulae VII-XIV) are made from the compound of Formula II (ECO-04601 ) by treatment with any of a number of epoxidizing reagents such as perbenzoic acid, monoperphthalic acid or more preferably by m-chloroperbenzoic acid in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that slightly greater than one molecule equivalent of epoxidizing agent will result in the maximal yield of mono-epoxides, and that the reagent, solvent, concentration and temperature of the reaction will dictate the ratio of specific mono-epoxides formed. It will also be appreciated that the mono-epoxides will be enantiorneric mixtures, and that the di-epoxides and the tri-epoxide can be prepared as diastereomers and that the conditions of the reaction will determine the ratios of the products. One skilled in the art will appreciate that under most conditions of reactions the product will be a mixture of all possible epoxides and that these may be separated by standard methods of chromatography. Exemplary approaches to the generation of mono-, di-and tri-epoxides are provided below.

EXAMPLE 11: GENES AND PROTEINS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF      COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA      Micromonospora sp. strain 046-EC011 is a representative microorganism useful in the production of the compound of the invention. Strain 046-EC011 has been deposited with the International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC), Bureau of Microbiology, Health Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2 on March 7, 2003 and was assigned IDAC accession no. 070303-01. The biosynthetic locus for the production of the compound of Formula ll wa s identified in the genome of Micromonospora sp. strain 046-EC011 using the genome scanning method described in USSN 10/232,370, CA 2,352,451 and Zazopoulos et. al., Nature 8iotechnol., 21, 187-190 (2003).      The biosynthetic locus spans approximately 52,400 base pairs of DNA and encodes 43 proteins. More than 10 kilobases of DNA sequence were analyzed on each side of the locus and these regions were deemed to contain primary genes or genes unrelated to the synthesis of the compound of Formula II. As illustrated in FIGURE 12, the locus is contained within three sequences of contiguous base pairs, namely Contig 1 having the 36,602 contiguous base pairs of SEQ ID NO: 1 and comprising ORFs 1 to 31 (SEQ ID NOS: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61 and 63), Contig 2 having the 5,960 contiguous base pairs of SEQ ID NO: 64 and comprising ORFs 32 to 35 (SEQ ID NOS: 66, 68, 70 and 72), and Contig 3 having the 9,762 base pairs of SEO ID NO: 73 and comprising ORFs 36 to 43 (SEQ ID NOS: 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85n 87 and 89). The order, relative position and orientation of the 43 open reading frames representing the proteins of the biosynthetic locus are illustrated schematically in FIGURE 12. The top line in FIGURE 12 provides a scale in base pairs. The gray bars depict the three DNA contigs (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 64 and 73) that cover the locus. The empty arrows represent the 43 open reading frames of this biosynthetic locus. The black arrows represent the two deposited cosmid clones covering the locus.      The biosynthetic locus will be further understood with reference to the sequence listing which provides contiguous nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of the locus from Micromonospora sp. strain 046-EC011. The contiguous nucleotide sequences are arranged such that, as found within the biosynthetic locus, Contig 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) is adjacent to the 5' end of Contig 2 (SEQ ID NO: 64), which in turn is adjacent to Contig 3 (SEQ ID NO: 73). The ORFs illustrated in FIGURE 12 and provided in the sequence listing represent open reading frames deduced from the nucleotide sequences of Contigs 1, 2 and 3 (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 64 and 73). Referring to the Sequence Listing, ORF 1 (SEQ ID NO: 3) is the polynucleotide drawn from residues 2139 to 424 of SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID     NO: 2 represents that polypeptide deduced from SEQ ID NO: 3. ORF 2 (SEQ ID NO: 5) is the polynucleotide drawn from residues 2890 to 4959 of SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 4 represents the polypeptide deduced from SEQ ID NO: 5. ORF 3 (SEQ ID NO: 7) is the polynucleotide drawn from residues 7701 to 5014 of SEQ  ID  NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 6 represents the polypeptide deduced from SEQ ID NO: 7. ORF 4 (SEQ ID NO: 9) is the polynucleotide drawn from residues 8104 to 9192 of SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 8 represents the polypeptide deduced from SEQ ID N0: 9. ORF 5 (SEQ ID .NO: 11 ) is the polynucleotide drawn from residues 9192 to 10256 of SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 10 represents the polypeptide deduced from SEQ ID NO: 11.

Some open reading frames provided in the Sequence Listing, namely ORF 2 (SEQ ID NO: 5), ORF 5 (SEQ ID NO: 11), ORF 12 (SEQ ID NO: 25), ORF 13 (SEQ    ID NO: 27), ORF 15 (SEQ ID NO: 31 ), ORF 17 (SEQ ID NO: 35), ORF 19 (SEQ ID   NO: 39), ORF 20 (SEQ ID NO: 41 ), ORF 22 (SEQ ID NO: 45), ORF 24 (SEQ ID N0:     49), ORF 26 (SEQ ID NO: 53) and ORF 27 (SEQ ID NO: 55) initiate with non-standard initiation codons (eg. GTG - Valine, or CTG - Leucine) rather than standard initiation codon ATG methionine. All ORFs are listed with the appropriate M, V or L amino acids at the amino-terminal position to indicate the specificity of the first codon of the ORF. It is expected, however, that in all cases the biosynthesized protein will contain a methionine residue, and more specifically a formylmethionine residue, at the amino terminal position, in keeping with the widely accepted principle that protein synthesis in bacteria initiate with methionine (formylmethionine) even when the encoding gene specifies a non-standard initiation codon (e.g. Stryer Biochemistry 3~d edition, 1998, W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, pp. 752-754).     ORF 32 (SEQ ID NO: 65) is incomplete and contains a truncation of 10 to 20 amino acids from its carboxy terminus. This is due to incomplete sequence information between Contigs 2 and 3 (SEQ ID NOS: 64 and 73, respectively).      Deposits of E. coli DH10B vectors, each harbouring a cosmid clone (designated in FIGURE 12 as 046KM and 046KQ respectively) of a partial biosynthetic locus for the compound of Formula II from Micromonospora sp.  strain 046-EC011 and together spanning the full biosynthetic locus for production of the compound of Formula II have been deposited with the International Depositary Authority of Canada, Bureau of Microbiology, Health Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2 on February 25, 2003. The cosmid clone designated 046KM was assigned deposit accession numbers IDAC 250203-06, and the cosmid clone designated 046KQ was assigned deposit accession numbers IDAC 250203-07. Cosmid 046KM covers residue 1 to residue 32,250 of Contig 1 (SEQ ID     NO: 1 ). Cosmid 046KQ covers residue 21,700 of Contig 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) to residue 9,762 of Contig 3 (SEQ ID NO: 73). The sequence of the polynucfeotides comprised in the deposited strains, as well as the amino acid sequence of any polypeptide encoded thereby are controlling in the event of any conflict with any description of sequences herein.      The deposit of the deposited strains has been made under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Micro-organisms for Purposes of Patent Procedure. The deposited strains will be irrevocably and without restriction or condition released to the public upon the issuance of a patent. The deposited strains are provided merely as convenience to those skilled in the art and are not an admission that a deposit is required for enablement, such as that: required under 35 U.S.C. ~112. A license may be required to make, use or sell the deposited strains, and compounds derived therefrom, and no such license is hereby granted. In order to identify the function of the proteins coded by the genes forming the biosynthetic locus for the production of the compound of Formula II the gene products of ORFs 1 to 43, namely SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 and 88 were compared, using the BLASTP version 2.2.10 algorithm with the default parameters, to sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant protein database and the DECIPHER~ database of microbial genes, pathways and natural products (Ecopia BioSciences Inc. St.-Laurent, QC, Canada).     The accession numbers of the top GenBankTM hits of this BLAST analysis are presented in Table 14 along with the corresponding E values. The E value relates the expected number of chance alignments with an alignment score at least equal to the observed alignment score. An E value of 0.00 indicates a perfect homolog.  The E values are calculated as described in Altschul et al. J. Mol. Biol., 215, (1990). The E value assists in the determination of whether two sequences display sufficient similarity to justify an inference of homology.     _98_ a T      Q     L            N     N~      O     f0p           .(0O     C            _ tn ~/JN f1O         N     U   N m   o   N     ,mcnY     N            i E      ~'coy U y U     vto t n N       U     C                   ~  N      O p ~ d ' w      U      U     V     O)    O _ O N O Ip      ' ' .N     _ ~             OO tlJf        O     C C  C C   d        ~~ U~ J O ~ ~     L VN  N N~      N     N                                               _ ~               U U  U U p /  O    N~  pM U     ~   J   N ON  ~ C     _     t M              fn7   ~              O     p tG ~ ~ N U QU  ~ Mp  E= ~ m E N Y ~ O               O  N Q7p7>, p~ N Q)  7N    ~ f4'Jc6  c0 E  E N~      E     O E  E E ~    ~    O   ~~ O   7 ~O          ~ ~ OO  Q  7  UO   O U X N X _~w C   N ~C ~  C     c '  ' ' ~    _    ~~       ~ ~ ~   n U)Y  a  a ~0 ~           g                     c  0 a  a a   ~ a~c  ~ .   ~' ~       >..      ~, , ~  ~ ~                          X           ~, w        O   OO    NU       ~   (0p N a7~  ~ OU ~   ~ ~                U     c0 c0c0p f~UN  Q UO  C~   ~     ~ U ViV7c0~  'O      N  p Q7O   Op  N UN  2'.,.~..N (4~ ~ ~ ~ C G y~  w p~0 N     p ~  ~  ~          _     U   Y Y     C  7 Q      ?,    >.~  ~ U~' U~ ~ Y ~ ~   ~     Ot  . =     O  O O ~ ~ ~~    ~O  U  ?

The farnesyl-diphosphate biosynthesis involves the concerted action of seven enzymes (FIGURE 13). ORF 10 (KASH) (SEQ ID NO: 20) encodes a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase that catalyzes an aldol addition of acetyl-CoA onto acetoacyl-CoA to yield 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). This product is subsequently reduced through the action of ORF 9 (HMGA) (SEQ ID NO: 18) to form mevalonic acid (MVA). ORF 5 (MVKA) (SEQ ID NO: 10) phosphorylates mevalonate to 5'-phosphomevalonate using ATP as the phosphate donor. The next step in the farnesyl-diphosphate biosynthesis is the phosphorylation reaction of the 5'-phosphomevalonate to 5'-pyrophosphomevalonate (DPMVA) that is catalyzed by ORF 7 (MVKP) (SEQ ID NO: 14). Subsequent decarboxylation of 5'-pyrophosphomevalonate catalyzed by ORF 6 (DMDA) (SEQ ID NO: 12) yields isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) which is then converted to dimethylallyldiphosphate (DMADP) through the action of ORF 8 (IPPI) (SEQ ID NO: 16) that has isomerase enzymatic activity. The final step in the biosynthesis of farnesyl-diphosphate is the condensation of one molecule of dimethylallyldiphosphate with two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate catalyzed by the isoprenyl diphosphate synthase ORF 4 (IDSA) (SEQ ID NO: 8). The described pathway involved in synthesis of farnesyl-diphosphate is entirely consistent with related mevalonate pathways described in other actinomycete species (Takagi et al., J. Bacteriol. 182, 4153-4157, (2000)).      Biosynthesis of the 3-hydroxy-anthranilate component involves the use of precursors derived from the shikimate pathway (FIGURE 14a). Chorismic acid is transaminated through the action of ORF 19 (CSMB) (SEQ ID NO: 38) to form aminodeoxyisochorismic acid. This enzyme resembles anthranilate syntheses and is likely to catalyze specifically the transfer of the amino group using glutamine as the amino donor. The next step involves isochorismatase activity and is mediated by ORF 27 (DHBS) (SEQ ID NO: 54). This reaction consists in the removal of the pyruvate side chain from aminodeoxyisochorismic acid to form 6-amino-5-hydroxy-cyclohexa-1,3-dienecarboxylic acid. This compound is subsequently oxidized through the action of ORF 26 (SDRA) (SEQ ID NO: 52) yielding 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid. ORF 24 (ADSA) (SEQ ID NO: 48) catalyzes the activation of 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid through adenylation generating the 3-hydroxy-anthranilate-adenylate component (FIGURE 14a).      Biosynthesis of the 2-amino-6-hydroxy-benzoquinone component of the compound of Formula II, requires components derived from the aminoshikimate pathway. FIGURE 14b depicts the series of enzymatic reactions involved in the biosynthesis of this constituent. ORF 21 (ALDB) (SEQ ID NO: 42) resembles aldolases involved in the generation of precursors of D-erythrose-4-phosphate which is part of the aminoshikimate pathway used for the generation of 2-amino-6-hydroxy-[1,4]-benzoquinone. ORF 33 (DAHP) (SEQ ID NO: 67) catalyzes the initial step in the aminoshikimate pathway that corresponds to the formation of 3,4-dideoxy-4~-amino-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (amino DAHP) from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E-4Ph). Subsequent reactions leading to 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid are catalyzed by enzymes provided by primary metabolism biosynthetic pathways present in Micromonospora sp. strain 046-EC011. ORF 25 (HOXV) (SEQ ID NO: 50) hydroxylates 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid at position 2, generating 3-amino-2,5-dihydroxy-benzoic acid.    This intermediate is further modified by ORF 32 (HOYH) (SEQ ID NO: 65) that catalyzes a decarboxylative oxidation reaction yielding 6-amino-benzene-1,2,4-trios. A final oxidation reaction is performed by ORF 16 (OXDS) (SEQ ID NO: 32) yielding 2-amino-6-hydroxy-[1,4]-benzoquinone (FIGURE 14b).    Assembly of the three components resulting in the compound of Formula II is catalyzed by ORFs 24 and 11 (FIGURE 15). ORF 24 (ADSA) (SEQ ID NO: 48) catalyzes the condensation of the adenylated 3-hydroxy-anthranilate with the 2-amino-6-hydroxy-[1,4]-benzoquinone component. A spontaneous condensation between the free amino group of the 3-hydroxy-anthranilate and one of the carbonyl groups present on the 2-amino-6-hydroxy-[1,4]-benzoquinone component occurs yielding a dibenzodiazepinone intermediate. This compound is further modified through transfer of the farnesyl group of the farnesyl-diphosphate intermediate onto the nitrogen of the amide of the dibenzodiazepinone catalyzed by ORF 11 (IPTN) (SEQ ID NO: 22) and resulting in the formation of the compound of Formula II     (FIGURE 15).      Additional ORFs, namely ORF 2 (RECH) (SEQ ID NO: 4), ORF 3 (REGD) (SEQ ID NO: 6), ORF 12 (SPKG) (SEQ ID NO: 24), ORF 13 (RREB) (SEQ ID NO: 26), ORF 34 (REGG) (SEQ ID NO: 69) and ORF 36 (RECI) (SEQ ID NO: 74) are involved in the regulation of the biosynthetic locus encoding the compound of Formula II.
