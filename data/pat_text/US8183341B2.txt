 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 This invention relates to novel antibacterial compounds derived from a novel microorganism,  Nonomuraea  sp Bp3714-39, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, and to methods for obtaining and using such compounds. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 The Streptosporangiaceae family are a subset of a large and complex group of Gram-positive bacteria collectively known as actinomycetes. Over the past few decades these organisms, which are abundant in soil, have generated significant commercial and scientific interest as a result of the large number of therapeutically useful compounds, particularly antibiotics, produced as secondary metabolites. The intensive search for strains able to produce new antibiotics has led to the identification of hundreds of new species. 
 A representative strain of actinomycetes, belonging to the Pseudonocardiaceae family,  Amycolatopsis  sp. MI481-42F4 produces Amythiamicin A to D, which show antibacterial activity (see  J. Antibiotics,  47 (1994), 668-674 and 1136-1153, JP1998059997(A), JP1997124503(A), JP1995215989(A), JP1994263784(A), JP1993310766(A), JP10059997A2(A), JP09124503A2(A)). 
 A problem of significant dimension is the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as the more virulent, methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) among clinical isolates found worldwide. As with vancomycin resistant organisms, many MRSA strains are resistant to most of the known antibiotics, but MRSA strains have remained sensitive to vancomycin. However, in view of the increasing reports of vancomycin resistant clinical isolates and growing problem of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for new molecular entities effective against the emerging and currently problematic Gram-positive organisms. 
 This growing multidrug resistance has recently rekindled interest in the search for new structural classes of antibiotics that inhibit or kill these bacteria. New antibiotics have been isolated from fungi and bacteria. 
 Although many biologically active compounds have been identified from bacteria, there remains the need to obtain novel compounds with enhanced properties. Current methods of obtaining such compounds include screening of natural isolates and chemical modification of existing compounds, both of which are costly and time consuming. 
 Thus, there exists a considerable need to obtain pharmaceutically active compounds in a cost-effective manner while producing high yield. The present invention solves these problems by providing a novel strain from the Streptosporangiaceae family capable of producing a potent new therapeutic compound and methods to generate such novel compounds

 II Antibiotic Compounds 
 In certain aspects, the compound of the present invention is characterized as a modulator of EF-Tu, including a prokaryotic EF-Tu, and especially including a bacterial EF-Tu. In a preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is an EF-Tu inhibitor. 
 EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function. Bacterial protein synthesis requires EF-Tu chaperone proteins. When bound to GTP, EF-Tu can form a complex with most aminoacylated tRNAs, loading the tRNA onto the ribosome. Consequently, bacterial infection has been associated with the activity of EF-Tu. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the disruption of EF-Tu synthesis or activity in the life cycle of a bacteria may prevent or inhibit bacterial function and/or proliferation. The compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in interfering with transcription or protein translation of Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria. 
 As used herein, the term “EF-Tu-associated state” or “EF-Tu-associated disorder” include disorders and states (e.g., a disease state) that are associated with the activity of EF-Tu. A non-limiting example of an EF-Tu associated disorder is a bacterial infection in a subject. 
 The present invention includes treatment of bacterial infections, as well as EF-Tu-associated disorders, as described above, but the invention is not intended to be limited to the manner by which the compound performs its intended function of treatment of a disease. The present invention includes treatment of diseases described herein in any manner that allows treatment to occur, e.g., bacterial infection. 
 In certain aspects, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition of any of the compounds of the present invention. In a related aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition of any of the compounds of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient of any of these compounds. In certain aspects, the invention includes the compounds as novel chemical entities. 
 In one aspect, the invention includes a packaged bacterial infection treatment. The packaged treatment includes a compound of the invention packaged with instructions for using an effective amount of the compound of the invention for an intended use. 
 The compounds of the present invention are suitable as active agents in pharmaceutical compositions that are efficacious particularly for treating bacterial infections. The pharmaceutical composition in various embodiments has a pharmaceutically effective amount of the present active agent along with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, fillers, diluents and the like. The phrase, “pharmaceutically effective amount” as used herein indicates an amount necessary to administer to a host, or to a cell, issue, or organ of a host, to achieve a therapeutic result, especially an anti-bacterial infection effect, e.g., inhibition of proliferation of a bacterium, or of any other bacterial infection. 
 In other aspects, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting the activity of an EF-Tu protein. The method includes contacting a cell with any of the compounds of the present invention. In a related aspect, the method further provides that the compound is present in an amount effective to selectively inhibit the activity of an EF-Tu protein. 
 In other aspects, the present invention provides a use of any of the compounds of the invention for manufacture of a medicament to treat a bacterial infection in a subject. 
 In other aspects, the invention provides a method of manufacture of a medicament, including formulating any of the compounds of the present invention for treatment of a subject. 
 The term “treat,” “treated,” “treating” or “treatment” includes the diminishment or alleviation of at least one symptom associated or caused by the state, disorder or disease being treated. In certain aspects, the treatment comprises the induction of a bacterial infection, followed by the activation of the compound of the invention, which would in turn diminish or alleviate at least one symptom associated or caused by the bacterial infection being treated. For example, treatment can be diminishment of one or several symptoms of a disorder or complete eradication of a disorder. 
 The term “subject” is intended to include organisms, e.g., prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which are capable of suffering from or afflicted with a bacterial infection. Examples of subjects include mammals, e.g., humans, dogs, cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, cats, mice, rabbits, rats, and transgenic non-human animals. In certain embodiments, the subject is a human, e.g., a human suffering from, at risk of suffering from, or potentially capable of suffering from a bacterial infection, and for diseases or conditions described herein. In another embodiment, the subject is a cell. 
 The language “EF-Tu-modulating compound,” “modulator of EF-Tu” or “EF-Tu inhibitor” refers to compounds that modulate, e.g., inhibit, or otherwise alter, the activity of EF-Tu. Examples of EF-Tu-modulating compounds include compounds of formulas I through XXII (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as well as enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, diastereomers, or racemates thereof). 
 Additionally, a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an effective amount of an EF-Tu-modulating compound of the invention, e.g., EF-Tu-modulating compounds of formulas I through XXII (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as well as enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, diastereomers, or racemates thereof).

 III. Method of Making Antibiotic Compounds by Fermentation 
 In one aspect, compounds I-XI are obtained by cultivating a novel strain of  Nonomuraea , namely  Nonomuraea  sp. strain Bp3714-39. Strain Bp3714-39 was deposited on 30 Nov. 2006 with the DSMZ. The deposit of the strain was made under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for Purposes of Patent Procedure. The deposited strains will be irrevocably and without restriction or condition released to the public upon the issuance of a patent. The deposited strains are provided merely as convenience to those skilled in the art and are not an admission that a deposit is required for enablement, such as that required under 35 U.S.C. §112. 
 It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to cultivation of the particular strain Bp3714-39. Rather, the present invention contemplates the cultivation of other organisms capable of producing compounds I-XI, such as mutants or variants of Bp3714-39 that can be derived from this organism by known means such as X-ray irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, treatment with chemical mutagens, phage exposure, antibiotic selection and the like. 
 The antibiotic compounds of the present invention may be biosynthesized by various microorganisms. Microorganisms that may synthesize the compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to bacteria of the order Actinomycetales, also referred to as actinomycetes. Non-limiting examples of members belonging to the genera of actinomycetes include  Nocardia, Geodermatophilus, Actinoplanes, Micromonospora, Nocardioides, Saccharothrix, Amycolatopsis, Kutzneria, Saccharomonospora, Saccharopolyspora, Salinospora, Kitasatospora, Streptomyces, Microbispora, Streptosporangium , and  Actinomadura . The taxonomy of actinomycetes is complex and reference is made to Goodfellow,  Suprageneric Classification of Actinomycetes  (1989);  Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology , Vol. 4 (Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, pp. 2322 2339); and to Embley and Stackebrandt, “ The molecular phylogeny and systematics of the actinomycetes ,” Annu. Rev. Microbiol. (1994) 48:257 289, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, for genera that may synthesize the compounds of the invention. 
 The compounds of structural formulas I to XI are produced by the aerobic fermentation of a suitable medium under controlled conditions via inoculation with a culture of the  eubacterium Nonomuraea  sp. The suitable medium is preferably aqueous and contains sources of assimilable carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic salts. 
 Suitable media include, without limitation, the growth media provided below in examples 1 and 2. The fermentation is conducted for about 2 to about 8 days at temperatures ranging from about 10° C. to about 40° C.; however for optimum results it is preferred to conduct the fermentation at about 30° C. The pH of the nutrient medium during the fermentation can be about 6.0 to about 9.0. 
 The culture media inoculated with the antibiotic compound producing microorganisms may be incubated under aerobic conditions using, for example, a rotary shaker or a stirred tank fermentor Aeration may be achieved by the injection of air, oxygen or an appropriate gaseous mixture to the inoculated culture media during incubation. As soon as a sufficient amount of the antibiotic compounds have accumulated, they may be concentrated and isolated from the culture in conventional and usual manner, for, example by extraction- and chromatographic methods, precipitation or crystallization, and/or in a manner disclosed herein. As an example for extraction, the culture can be mixed and stirred with a suitable organic solvent such as n-butanol, ethyl acetate, cyclohexane, n-hexane, toluene, n-butyl acetate or 4-methyl-2-pentanone, the antibiotic compounds in the organic layer can be recovered by removal of the solvent under reduced pressure. The resulting residue can optionally be reconstituted with for example water, ethanol, methanol or a mixture thereof, and re-extracted with a suitable organic solvent such as hexane, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, dichloromethane or a mixture thereof. Following removal of the solvent, the compounds may be further purified for example by chromatographic methods. As an example for chromatography, stationary phases such as silica gel or aluminia oxide can be applied, with organic eluting solvents or mixtures thereof, including ethers, ketones, esters, halogenated hydrocarbons or alcohols, or reversed-phase chromatography on modified silica gel having various functional groups and eluting with organic solvents or aqueous mixtures thereof, like acetonitrile, methanol or tetrahydrofuran at different pH. Another example is partition-chromatography, for example in the solid-liquid or in the liquid-liquid mode. Also size exclusion chromatography may be applied, for example using Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluting with different solvents, preferably with alcohols. 
 As it is usual in this field, the production as well as the recovery and purification process may be monitored by a variety of analytical methods, including bioassays, TLC, HPLC or a combination thereof, and applying different detection methods, for TLC typically UV light, iodine vapor or spraying coloring reagents, for HPLC typically UV light, mass sensitive or light scattering methods. For example a HPLC technique is represented by using a reversed-phase column with a functionalized silica gel and applying an eluent which is a linear gradient mixture of a polar water miscible solvent and water at a specific pH, and a detection method with UV light at different wavelengths and a mass sensitive detector. 
 The antibiotic compound biosynthesized by microorganisms may optionally be subjected to random and/or directed chemical modifications to form compounds that are derivatives or structural analogs. Such derivatives or structural analogs having similar functional activities are within the scope of the present invention. Antibiotic compounds may optionally be modified using methods known in the art and described herein. Preferred synthetic antibiotic compounds include those selected from the group consisting of formulas XII to XXII and prepared as described herein. 
 Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, IC 50  and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about”. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the present specification and attached claims are approximations. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant figures and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set in the examples, Tables and Figures are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values may inherently contain certain errors resulting from variations in experiments, testing measurements, statistical analyses and such. 
 Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.

 A frozen suspension (1.5 mL) of a  Nonomuraea  sp. strain Bp3714-39 is inoculated into a two liter non-baffled shake flask containing 500 mL of seed medium. The flask is incubated for 3 days at 30° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and with 50 mm amplitude. The second seed stage is developed by inoculating 40 mL each, of the first stage seed into eight two liter non-baffled shake flasks each containing 500 mL of seed medium. The flask is incubated for 2 days at 30° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and with 50 mm amplitude. A third seed stage is developed by inoculating 4 liters each, of the second stage seed into two 150 liter scale stirred tank fermentors containing each 100 liters of seed medium. The 150 liter scale fermentors are operated for 3 days with the following parameters: Temperature=30° C., agitation=80 rpm, airflow=25 slpm, and pressure=0.5 bar. Excess foam formation is prevented by controlled addition of silicon oil-based antifoam agent. pH is monitored but not controlled. 
 A 5500 liter scale stirred tank fermentor containing 3500 liters of production medium A is inoculated with 200 liters from the third seed stage. Operating parameters of the 5500 liter scale fermentor are: Temperature=30° C., airflow=1050 slpm, and pressure=0.5 bar. Agitation is controlled at 60 rpm and, after 44 hours, increased to 80 rpm. Excess foam formation is prevented by controlled addition of silicon oil-based antifoam agent. pH is monitored but not controlled. The fermentor containing 3500 liters of broth is harvested after 5 days of incubation. 
 Isolation of Compound I 
 3500 L fermentation broth are harvested and extracted over night in a stirred tank by addition of 3900 L of ethyl acetate. As the pH of the fermentation broth is neutral at harvest (pH 7-8) there was no need to adjust the pH before extraction. During extraction the mixture is passed for 2 hours through a continuous Dispax® reactor (Jahnke & Kunkel, Germany) for maximum sheer force and optimal mixing. After separating the two phases on a continuous Westfalia separator SA20 (Westfalia Separator AG, Oelde, Germany) the ethyl acetate phase is concentrated to a volume of 30 liters by evaporation under reduced pressure. During evaporation a precipitate is formed which is separated by filtration. The precipitate had a dry weight of 197 g 
 4 g of the precipitate obtained from the extraction of the culture broth according to the procedure described above is dissolved in 20 ml Dioxane/water 95:5 and filtered to remove insoluble ingredients. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure in the presence of 8 g diatome 8 (Isolute®, International Sorbent Technology Ltd., Hengoed Mid Glam, UK) The obtained powder is applied to a chromatographic column containing 180 g silica gel (0.040-0.063 mm, column size 5×25 cm) prepared in dichloromethane/methanol/acetic acid 90:10:0.5. The column is developed with a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol/acetic acid 90:10:0.5 at a flow rate of 35 mL/min. Fractions of 30 mL are collected, which are analyzed by HPLC. To the pooled  fractions containing compound  120 mL Isopropanol is added and concentrated under reduced pressure until the compound precipitates from the remaining Isopropanol. After separating of the solvent from the precipitate through centrifugation the residue is dried under reduced pressure yielding in 800 mg semi-purified compound I. 
 For further purification the semi-purified material is dissolved in small volume of dioxane/water 95/5 and charged to a silica gel column, which is prepared and eluted under the same conditions as described for the first chromatographic step. The work up of the pooled fraction is identical to the work up of the first chromatographic step. After repetition of the second chromatographic step 61 mg compound I is obtained.

 A frozen suspension (1.5 mL) of a  Nonomuraea  sp. strain Bp3714-39 is inoculated into a 500 mL non-baffled shake flask containing 50 mL of seed medium. The flask is incubated for 5 days at 28° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and with 50 mm amplitude. The second seed stage is developed by inoculating 5 mL each, of the first stage seed into eight 2-liter non-baffled shake flasks each containing 500 mL of seed medium. The flasks are incubated for 3 days at 28° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and with 50 mm amplitude. 
 A 150 liter scale stirred tank fermentor containing 100 liters of production medium B is inoculated with 4 liters from the second seed stage. Operating parameters of the 150 liter scale fermentor are: Temperature=28° C., airflow=50 slpm, and pressure=0.5 bar. Agitation is controlled at 80 rpm. Excess foam formation is prevented by controlled addition of silicon oil-based antifoam agent. pH is monitored but not controlled. The fermentor containing 100 liters of broth is harvested after 5 days of incubation. Before harvesting the pH of the fermentation broth was set to pH 4.5 by addition of 300 ml of 4N H 2 SO 4 . 
 Isolation of Compounds II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX 
 100 L fermentation broth are harvested and extracted in a stirred tank by addition of 200 liters ethyl acetate and passing for 1 hour through a continuous Dispax® reactor (Jahnke&Kunkel, Germany) for maximum sheer force and optimal mixing. Afterwards the two phases are separated and the organic phase containing the extracted metabolites is evaporated under reduced pressure until dry, resulting in 98 g dry extract. For de-fatting the extract is solved in 1 liter MeOH/H 2 O 9/1 and extracted 3 times with 1 liter cyclohexane. The hexane phase containing the fatty compounds is discarded whereas the MeOH phase is evaporated under reduced pressure with the addition of 1 liter water. The water phase is re-extracted with 3 liters ethyl acetate. After separation, the organic phase is evaporated until dry, resulting in 9.3 g of de-fatted extract. 
 The extract is dissolved in methanol and applied to a column containing Sephadex LH20 prepared in methanol. The column is eluted with Methanol. Fractions containing the compounds are further purified using reversed phase chromatography with water and acetonitrile or methanol as solvent system. To the solvents 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid or 0.1% orthophosphoric acid are added. Fractions containing the compounds are diluted with the same volume of water, adsorbed on Oasis HLB column (Waters Corporation, USA) and eluted with Methanol and evaporated to dryness. 
 The purification yielded in 12 mg compound II, 1 mg compound III, 4 mg compound IV), 2 mg compound V, 0.5 mg compound VI, 2 mg compound VII, 8 mg compound VIII and 5 mg compound IX.
