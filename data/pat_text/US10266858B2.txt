 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a recombinant microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an enhanced ability to produce L-arginine, and method for producing L-arginine using the same. 
 Incorporated by reference herein in its entirety is the Sequence Listing entitled “Sequence list.txt”, created Oct. 16, 2015, size of 22 kilobytes. 
 Description of the Prior Art 
 L-arginine is contained in garlic or seed of plants as free-form. L-arginine is widely used in medicaments, foods and the like and is also used as an amino acid fortified dietary supplements. 
 Microorganisms of the genus  Corynebacterium  biosynthesize L-arginine through a cyclic pathway. L-arginine is synthesized from L-glutamate via N-acetylglutamate, N-acetylglutamyl phosphate, N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde, N-acetylornithine, ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate. 
 Further, it is known that  Corynebacterium glutamicum  is regulated by feedback inhibition due to intracellular arginine (Vehary Sakanyan, et al, Microbiology, 142:9-108, 1996), suggesting that the production of L-arginine in high yield is limited. 
 Ikeda et al. reported that citrulline is accumulated on a fermentation medium during arginine fermentation (Appl Environ Microbiol. 2009 March; 75(6):1635-41. Epub 2009 Jan. 9). 
 In the biosynthesis process, citrulline binds to aspartate to generate argininosuccinate, which then release fumarate to generate arginine. In this process, aspartate ammonia-lyase (AspA) is an enzyme that synthesizes aspartate from fumarate and ammonia ( FIG. 1 ), and aspartate aminotransferase (AspB) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of various L-amino acids by transferring the amino group of various L-amino acids such as aspartate, glutamate and aminobutyrate onto the keto-acids such as α-ketoglutaric acid and α-ketoisovaleric acid. 
 Menkel et al. reported that when  E. coli  aspA was introduced into microorganisms of the genus  Corynebacterium , the microorganisms of  Corynebacterium  increased the availability of aspatate and then increased lysine production (APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY, March 1989, p. 684-688). 
 Accordingly, the present invention provides a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  which has an enhaced ability to produce L-arginine by increasing influx of aspartate that binds to citrulline through the expression enhancement of aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an enhanced ability to produce L-arginine. 
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing L-arginine using the above microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium.    
 To achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an enhanced ability to produce L-arginine by enhancement of aspartate ammonia-lyase activity. 
 The present invention also provides a method of producing L-arginine by culturing the above microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium.    
 
 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS 
   FIG. 1  shows a pathway for synthesizing arginine from citrulline and a pathway for synthesizing aspartate from fumarate. 
 
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. 
 The present invention provides a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an enhanced ability to produce L-arginine. 
 As used herein, the term “an ability to produce L-arginine (L-arginine productivity)” refers to the ability to accumulate L-arginine in a medium for culturing the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  during culture. Such the ability to produce L-arginine may be either the property of a wild-type or the property imparted or enhanced by artificial mutation, of the microorganisms of the genus  Corynebacterium.    
 For example, in order to impart the ability to produce L-arginine, a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  can be breed as a variant having resistance to arginine hydroxamate; a variant having auxotrophy for succinic acid or having resistance to a nucleic acid base analogue; a variant deficient in the ability to metabolize arginine and having resistance to an arginine antagonist and canavanine and auxotrophy for lysine; variant having resistance to arginine, arginine hydroxamate, homoarginine, D-arginine and canavanine, or resistance to arginine hydroxamate and 6-azauracil; or a variant having resistance to canavanine. 
 In addition, the ability to produce L-arginine can be imparted by modifying a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  so as to increase the expression level of genes encoding enzymes to biosynthesize L-arginine. Examples of enzymes to biosynthesize L-arginine may include N-acetylglutamyl phosphate reductase (ArgC), ornithine acetyl transferase (ArgJ), N-acetylglutamate kinase (ArgB), acetylornithine transaminase (ArgD), ornithine carbamoyl transferase (ArgF), argininosuccinic acid synthetase (ArgG), argininosuccinic acid lyase (ArgH), and carbomyl phosphate synthetase. These enzymes are placed in the Arg operon (argCJBDFRGH) and are regulated by an arginine repressor encoded by argR (J Bacteriol. 2002 December; 184(23):6602-14.). Thus, an ability to produce L-arginine may be imparted by attenuating the arginine repressor (US2002-0045223) or overexpressing at least one of the biosynthesis-related genes. 
 In the present invention, the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an ability to produce L-arginine is not specifically limited as long as it can produce L-arginine. Specifically, it may be  Corynebacterium glutamicum  having the capability to produce L-arginine. More specifically, it may be  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741 (Korean Patent Registration No. 10-0791659) or  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC21831), but it's not limited thereof. 
 In one aspect, the present invention provides a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an enhanced ability to produce L-arginine by enhancement of aspartate ammonia-lyase activity. 
 As used herein, the term “aspartate ammonia-lyase (AspA)” refers an enzyme functioning to synthesize aspartate from fumarate and ammonia, and the synthesis of aspartate may be increased by enhancing the expression of aspartate ammonia-lyase, and thereby L-arginine productivity may be increased by the increased aspartate. 
 In the present invention, the aspartate ammonia-lyase may be an enzyme derived from any microorganism, as long as it has the aspartate ammonia-lyase activity. Specifically, the aspartate ammonia-lyase may be an enzyme derived from a microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  or the genus  Corynebacterium . More specifically, it may be an enzyme derived from  E. coli  or  Corynebacterium glutamicum . Specifically, the aspartate ammonia-lyase may have an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 21 or 22. The  Corynebacterium -derived aspartate ammonia-lyase having the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 21 is encoded by aspA (NCg11446) having a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 23, and the  Escherichia -derived aspartate ammonia-lyase having an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 22 is encoded by aspA (NCBI GENE ID: 12933698) having a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 24. 
 A protein having a homology of at least 80%, specifically at least 90%, more specifically at least 95%, and even more specifically at least 97% to the amino acid sequence of the aspartate ammonia-lyase described above, is also included in the scope of the present invention, as long as it has the aspartate ammonia-lyase activity described in the present invention. 
 As used herein, the term “homology” refers to the identity between two amino acid sequences and may be determined by the well known method well known to those skilled in the art, using algorithm BLAST (see Karlin and Altschul, Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 5873 (1993)) or FASTA (see Pearson, Methods Enzymol., 183, 63 (1990)) to compute the parameter such as score, identity and similarity. Based on the algorithm BLAST, a program called BLASTN or BLASTX has been developed (see gay). 
 In another aspect, the present invention provides a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium , wherein the activity of aspartate aminotransferase is further enhanced. 
 As used herein, the term “aspartate aminotransferase” may be derived from a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium , have an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 25 and is encoded by aspB (NCg10237) having a nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 26, but it's not limited thereto. 
 A protein having a homology of at least 80%, specifically at least 90%, more specifically at least 95%, and even more specifically at least 97% to the amino acid sequence of the aspartate aminotransferase described above, is also included in the scope of the present invention, as long as it has the aspartate aminotransferase activity described in the present invention. Homology to the amino acid sequence can be determined by, for example, algorithm BLAST (see Karlin and Altschul, Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 5873 (1993)) or FASTA (see Pearson, Methods Enzymol., 183, 63 (1990)). Based on this algorithm, a program called BLASTN or BLASTX has been developed (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). 
 In still another aspect, the present invention provides a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium , wherein activity of aspartate ammonia-lyase and aspartate aminotransferase are both enhanced. 
 The inventive microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an ability to produce L-arginine is characterized to be modified by enhancing (or increasing) the activity of aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase, to the endogenous activity. 
 As used herein, the term “endogenous activity” refers to the activity of a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an ability to produce L-arginine which did not undergo any genetic manipulation or modification for regulating the activities of the above-described enzymes. In addition, the term “enhanced” or “increased” means that L-arginine productivity was improved compared to the endogenous activity of a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an ability to produce L-arginine. 
 Enhancing (or increasing) the activity of the enzyme in the present invention can be performed using various methods well known in the art. Examples of these methods include a method of increasing the copy number of a nucleotide sequence encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase by introducing a polynucleotide encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase into a vector system, a method of replacing the promoter with a strong promoter, a method of introducing a mutation into the promoter, and a method based on genetic mutation, but are not limited thereto. 
 In one specific embodiment of the present invention, in order to enhance the activity of aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase in the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with an ability to produce L-arginine, a method may be used in which a copy number of the gene encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase is increased by introducing the gene encoding aspartated aspartate ammonia-lyase and/or aspartate aminotransferase into a vector and transforming the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  with the vector. 
 As used herein, the term “transforming” means introducing a vector containing a polynucleotide encoding a target protein into a host cell so that the target protein can be expressed in the host cell. The introduced polynucleotide may be located inside or outside the chromosome of the host cell, as long as it can be expressed in the host cell. The polynucleotide may be introduced in any form, as long as it can be expressed in the host cell. 
 In an embodiment of the present invention, the transformed microorganism was prepared by introducing the recombinant vector containing the above-described genes, and was then isolating L-arginine-producing strain containing 2 copies of each of the above genes in the chromosome via a second crossover. 
 As used herein, the term “vector” refers to a DNA construct containing the nucleotide sequence of a target protein-encoding polynucleotide which is operably linked to a suitable regulatory sequence to be able to express the target protein in a suitable host. The regulatory sequence may include a promoter for initiating transcription, any operator sequence for regulating such transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites, and sequences which regulate termination of transcription and translation. After being transformed into a suitable host, the vector may be replicated or perform its function irrespective of the host genome, or may be integrated into the genome itself. 
 The vector that is used in the present invention is not specifically limited, as long as it can be replicated in a host. The vector may be any vector known in the art. Examples of vectors that are commonly used may include natural or recombinant plasmids, cosmids, viruses and bacteriophages. 
 The  Corynebacterium glutamicum  (KCCM11351P) strain transformed by the method of the present invention is produced by obtaining aspA encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase from the chromosome of L-arginine-producing  Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 21831 by PCR, inserting the obtained aspA into a vector, and then introducing the vector into L-arginine-producing  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and then is a transformed microorganism which has increased expression of aspA. It was found that the strain KCCM11351P can produce L-arginine in high yield by overexpression of aspA. 
 In yet another aspect, the present invention also provides a method of producing L-arginine by culturing the transformed  Corynebacterium  microorganism. 
 In the inventive method of producing L-arginine, the process of culturing the transformed microorganism overexpressing L-arginine can be performed in suitable media and culture conditions known in the art. This culture process can be easily adjusted by any person skilled in the art depending on a selected strain. Examples of the culture process include, but are not limited to, batch culture, continuous culture, and fed-batch culture. Such culture processes are disclosed, for example, in “Biochemical Engineering” (James M. Lee, Prentice-Hall International Editions, pp 138-176, 1991). 
 The medium that is used in the present invention contains raw sugar or glucose as a main carbon source. Further, molasses containing a large amount of raw sugar may also be used as a carbon source. In addition, suitable amounts of various carbon sources may be used, and specifically purified glucose may be used. Examples of a nitrogen source that may be used in the present invention include organic nitrogen sources such as peptone, yeast extract, beef stock, malt extract, corn steep liquor, and soybean flour; and inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium nitrate. Specifically, peptone may be used. These nitrogen sources may be used alone or in combination. The medium may contain, as a phosphorus source, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen diphosphate and corresponding sodium-containing salts. Further, the medium may contain a metal salt such as magnesium sulfate or iron sulfate. In addition, the medium may contain amino acids, vitamins and appropriate precursors. These media or precursors may be added in a batch or continuous manner in the culture. However, the examples of a culture medium composition are not limited thereto. 
 A compound such as ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia, phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid may be added to a culture medium during culture in a suitable manner to adjust the pH of the culture medium. Moreover, a anti-foaming agent such as fatty acid polyglycol ester may be added during culture to inhibit the bubbling. In addition, in order to maintain an aerobic condition of culture medium, oxygen or oxygen-containing gas (e.g., air) may be injected into the culture medium. The temperature of the culture medium may be generally between 20° C. and 45° C., and specifically between 25° C. and 40° C. The culture may be performed until a desired amount of L-arginine is produced. Specifically, the culture time may be 10-160 hours. 
 Separation of L-arginine from the culture medium can be performed by a conventional method known in the art. The method may include centrifugation, filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and crystallization. For example, L-arginine can be separated by centrifuging the culture medium at low speed to remove biomass, and then separating the remained supernatant by ion exchange chromatography. 
 Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to examples. It is to be understood, however, that these examples are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. 
 EXAMPLES 
 Example 1: Examination of the Effect of aspA on Production of L-Arginine 
 In order to examine whether aspA is a significant gene in the production of L-arginine, an aspA-deleted vector was constructed and transformed into the L-arginine-producing strain  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P (Korean Patent Registration No. 0791659), and then the L-arginine productivity of the transformed strain was evaluated. 
 (1) Construction of aspA-Deficient Vector 
 In order to delete aspA gene encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase (Ncg11446) from the chromosome, the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC21831 purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) was extracted using a Genomic-tip system (QIAGEN), and crossover PCR was performed using chromosome as a template. 
 Specifically, an about 798-bp fragment having an XmaI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase using primers of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94 t for 1 min, annealing at 58 t for 30 sec and polymerization at 72 t for 60 sec. Then, an about 829-bp fragment having an XbaI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified by PCR using primers of SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4 in the same manner as described above. The resulting DNA fragments were isolated using GeneAll® Expin™ GEL SV kit (Seoul, Korea) and were then used as a template for crossover PCR. 
 In order to obtain a DNA fragment containing deleted-aspA, crossover PCR was performed using the above-prepared two DNA fragments as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 4. Specifically, an about 1583-bp fragment was amplified by the above-described PCR method. The amplified fragment was treated with the restriction enzymes XmaI and XbaI, and then ligated with a pD vector treated with the same enzymes, thereby constructing the vector pDKO1446. 
 (2) Preparation of Recombinant Strain 
 The pDKO1446 vector constructed as described above was transformed into the L-arginine-producing strain  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and subjected to a second crossover, thereby obtaining an L-arginine-producing strain containing a deleted-aspA in the chromosome. The obtained strain was named “KCCM10741ΔaspA”. 
 (3) Examination of L-Arginine Productivity of Recombinant Strain 
 In order to examine the effect of a deletion of aspA on L-arginine productivity, the above-produced recombinant  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741ΔaspA that is an L-arginine-producing strain was cultured in the following manner. 
 As a control group, the host cell,  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P, were used. Specifically, a loop of the strain was inoculated into a 250 ml corner-baffle flask containing 25 ml of the following production medium, and was cultured at 30° C. for 48 hours at 200 rpm. After completion of the culture, the production of L-arginine was measured by HPLC, and the results are shown in Table 1 below. 
 Production Medium 
 6% glucose, 3% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.2% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 1.5% corn steep liquor (CSL), 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract, 100 mg/L biotin, pH 7.2.

 As can be seen in Table 1 above, the strain containing a deleted-aspA had a reduced ability to produce L-arginine, and aspA was a significant gene in the production of L-arginine. 
 Example 2: Construction of Vector for Introducing aspA Derived from  Corynebacterium    
 In order to construct a vector containing two copies of aspA (Ncg11446 encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase derived from  Corynebacterium , PCR was performed using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC21831 as a template and each of a primer set of SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6 and a primer set of SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8, thereby obtaining DNA fragments, each containing aspA. 
 Specifically, an about 1893-bp fragment having an XmaI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region and a BamHI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase using the primers of SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6. The PCR was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94° C. for 1 min, annealing at 58° C. for 30 sec and polymerization at 72° C. for 2 min. Meanwhile, an about 1885-bp fragment having a BamHI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region and an XbaI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified using the primers of SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8 in the same manner as described above. 
 The obtained DNA fragments were separated using GeneAll® Expin™ GEL SV kit (Seoul, Korea). Then, the first fragment of the two fragments above was treated with XmaI and BamHI, and the second fragment was treated with BamHI and XbaI. In addition, a pD vector was treated with XmaI and XbaI. The two DNA fragments and pD vector, treated with the restriction enzymes, were ligated, and thereby constructing a pD1446-2X vector. 
 Example 3: Preparation of Recombinant Strains Having Increased Expression of aspA 
 The pD1446-2X vector constructed in Example 2 was transformed into each of the L-arginine-producing strains,  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and ATCC21831, and then subjected to a second crossover, thereby obtaining L-arginine-producing strains containing 2 copies of aspA in the chromosome. The obtained strains were named “KCCM10741P:aspA_2X” and “ATCC21831:aspA_2X”, respectively. 
 Example 4: Construction of Vector for Introducing aspB Derived from  Corynebacterium    
 In order to construct a vector containing 2 copies of aspB (Ncg10237) encoding aspartate aminotransferase, PCR was performed using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 21831 as a template and each of a primer set of SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10 and a primer set of SEQ ID NOs: 11 and 12, thereby obtaining DNA fragments, each containing aspB. 
 Specifically, an about 1692-bp fragment having an XmaI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region and a NdeI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase using the primers of SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10. The PCR was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at ° C. for 1 min, annealing at 58° C. for 30 sec and polymerization at 72° C. for 2 min. Meanwhile, an about 1643-bp second fragment having a NdeI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region and a SpeI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified by the same PCR method as described above. 
 The obtained DNA fragments were isolated using GeneAll® Expin™ GEL SV kit (Seoul, Korea). Then, the first fragment of the two fragments above was treated with XmaI and NdeI, and the second fragment was treated with NdeI and SpeI. In addition, a pD vector was treated with XmaI and XbaI. The pD vector and the two DNA fragments, which were treated with the restriction enzymes, were subjected to 3-piece ligation, thereby constructing a pD0237-2X vector. 
 Example 5: Preparation of Strains Having Increased Expression of aspB 
 The pD0237-2X vector constructed in Example 4 was transformed into each of the L-arginine-producing strains,  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and ATCC21831, and then subjected to a second crossover, thereby obtaining L-arginine-producing strains containing 2 copies of aspB in the chromosome. The obtained strains were named “KCCM10741P:aspB_2X” and “ATCC21831:aspB_2X”, respectively. 
 Example 6: Preparation of Strains Having Increased Expression of aspA and aspB 
 The pD0237-2X vector constructed in Example 4 was transformed into each of the recombinant strains (KCCM10741P:aspA_2X and ATCC21831:aspA_2X) prepared in Example 3, and were then subjected to a second crossover, thereby obtaining L-arginine-producing strains containing 2 copies of aspA and aspB in the chromosome. The obtained strains were named “KCCM10741P:aspA_2X:aspB_2X” and “ATCC21831:aspA_2X:aspB_2X”. 
 Example 7: Evaluation of L-Arginine Productivity 
 In order to examine the effect of an increase in aspA, aspB or both aspA and aspB on L-arginine productivity, each of the L-arginine-producing strains,  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P:aspA_2X, ATCC21831:aspA_2X, KCCM10741P:aspB_2X, ATCC21831:aspB_2X, KCCM10741P:aspA_2X:aspB_2X and ATCC21831:aspA_2X:aspB_2X, prepared in Examples 3, 5 and 6, was cultured in the following manner. 
 As a control group, the host cells of each of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and ATCC21831 were used. Specifically, a loop of each of the strains was inoculated into a 250-ml corner-baffle flask containing 25 ml of the production medium described in Example 1, and the inoculated strains were cultured at 30° C. for 48 hours at 200 rpm. After completion of the culture, the production of L-arginine was measured, and the results of the measurement are shown in Table 2 below.

 As can be seen in Table 2 above, the production of L-arginine was increased in the two types of the  Corynebacterium glutamicum  strains when 2 copies of aspA was introduced into the strains. Particularly, the L-arginine productivity of KCCM10741P:aspA_2X was remarkably increased by 30% compared to that of the control group. KCCM10741P:aspA_2X was deposited in the Korean Culture Center of Microorganism (KCCM), an international depository authority located at 361-221, Hongje 1-dong Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea, on Jan. 21, 2013 under the accession number KCCM11351P. 
 Example 8: Construction of Vector for Introducing aspA Derived from the Genus  E. coli    
 To introduce aspA (NCBI-GeneID: 12933698), a gene encoding aspartate ammonia-lyase derived from the genus  E. coli , into the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  with an ability to produce L-arginine, a Ncg11221 site known as a glutamate exporter was used (yggB: Appl Environ Microbiol. 2007 July; 73(14):4491-8). 
 In order to construct a vector having an  E. coli  aspA introduced into the Ncg11221 site, a pDKO1221 vector containing a site-specific gene disruption of Ncg11221 was constructed. 
 In order to obtain a DNA fragment containing a site-specific gene disruption of Ncg11221, the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC21831 was extracted, and crossover PCR was performed using the chromosome as a template. Specifically, an about 789-bp fragment having an EcoRI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase using primers of SEQ ID NOs: 13 and 14. The PCR was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation 94° C. for 1 min, annealing at 58° C. for 30 sec and polymerization at 72° C. for 60 sec. Meanwhile, an about 835-bp fragment having a PstI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified by PCR using primers of SEQ ID NOS: 15 and 16 in the same manner as described above. The obtained DNA fragments were isolated using GeneAll® Expin™ GEL SV kit (Seoul, Korea) and were then used as a template for crossover PCR. 
 To obtain a DNA fragment containing the site-specific gene disruption of Ncg11221, crossover PCR was performed using the above-obtained two DNA fragments as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOs: 13 and 16. Specifically, an about 1602-bp fragment was amplified by the above-described PCR method. The amplified fragment was treated with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI, and then ligated with a pD vector treated with the same restriction enzymes, thereby constructing a pDKO1221 vector. 
 Using the constructed pDKO1221 vector, a vector having an  E. coli  aspA introduced therein was constructed. To obtain a cj7 promoter (Korean Patent No. 10-0620092) that operates in  Corynebacterium glutamicum , an about 524-bp fragment having a BamHI restriction enzyme site in the 5′ region was amplified by PCR with Pfu polymerase using p117 pcj7-gfp as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 18. The PCR was performed for 30 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 94° C. for 1 min, annealing at 58° C. for 30 sec and polymerization at 72° C. for 30 sec.  E. coli  derived-aspA was extracted from the chromosome of  E. coli  W3110 using a Genomic-tip system (QIAGEN), and an about 1607-bp fragment having an XbaI restriction enzyme site in the 3′ region was amplified using the chromosome as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20. The obtained DNA fragments were isolated using GeneAll® Expin™ GEL SV kit (Seoul, Korea) and were then used as a template for crossover PCR. 
 To obtain a DNA fragment of  E. coli  derived-aspA, crossover PCR was performed using the above-obtained two DNA fragments as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 20. Specifically, an about 2095-bp fragment was amplified by the above-described PCR method. The amplified fragment was treated with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XbaI, and then ligated with a pDKO1221 vector treated with the same restriction enzymes, thereby constructing a pDKO1221-EC_aspA vector. 
 Example 9: Preparation of Recombinant Strain Having Increased Expression of  E. coli  aspA 
 The pDKO1221-EC_aspA vector constructed as described above was transformed into each of the L-arginine-producing strains  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and ATCC21831 and subjected to a second crossover, thereby obtaining L-arginine-producing strains, each containing  E. coli  derived-aspA gene in the chromosome. The obtained stains were named “KCCM10741PΔNcg11221-EC_aspA” and “ATCC21831ΔNcg11221-EC_aspA”, respectively. In addition, the pDKO1221 vector constructed as described above was transformed into each of the L-arginine-producing strains  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P and ATCC21831 and subjected to a second crossover, thereby obtaining KCCM10741PΔNcg11221 and ATCC21831ΔNcg11221 strains, each containing a deleted NCg11221 in the chromosome. 
 Example 10: Evaluation of L-Arginine Productivity of Recombinant Strains Having Increased Expression of  E. coli  aspA 
 In order to evaluate the effect of introduction of  E. coli  aspA on L-arginine productivity, the L-arginine-producing strains KCCM10741PΔNcg11221-EC_aspA and ATCC21831ΔNcg11221-EC_aspA prepared in Example 9 were cultured in the following manner. 
 As a control group, the host cells of each of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM10741P, ATCC21831, KCCM10741PΔNcg11221 and ATCC21831ΔNcg11221 were cultured. Specifically, a loop of each strain was inoculated into a 250 ml corner-baffle flask containing 25 ml of the above-described production medium and was cultured at 30 t for 48 hours at 200 rpm. After completion of the culture, the production of L-arginine was measured, and the results are shown in Table 3 below.

 As can be seen in Table 3 above, the production of L-arginine in the two types of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  was increased when  E. coli  aspA was introduced into the strains. As described above, the present invention provides the recombinant microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium , which has enhanced aspartate ammonia-lyase activity and/or enhanced aspartate aminotransferase activity, and thus has an enhanced ability to produce L-arginine. The recombinant microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  can produce L-arginine in high yield, and thus is industrially useful. From the foregoing, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in other specific forms without departing from the technical spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Accordingly, it should be understood that the above-described embodiments are illustrative in all respects and not restrictive. The scope of the present invention should be defined by the appended claims rather than the detailed description, and it should be appreciated that all the modifications or changes derived from the meaning and scope of the claims and the equivalents thereof fall within the scope of the present invention.
