Fructose is mixed or contacted with fructose by making to be fixed on the corynebacterium in matrix and carried out, thus by fructose converting for A Luo
Ketose. 
 For effective production of psicose in the method, as substrate fructose in the reactive mixture with 40~
75% (w/v) concentration is used, for example, used with the concentration of 50~75% (w/v) concentration.In this manner, than the lower limit of fructose
Low concentration can reduce the economic feasibility of psicose.On the other hand, if fructose higher than the concentration of the upper limit to exist, its
It is more difficult to dissolving.Therefore, concentration is preferably within the scope of this.Fructose can be buffer soln or the aqueous solution (such as distilled water)
Form. 
 Reaction can be in 6~9.5 times progress of pH, such as in pH 7~9, pH 7~8,8~9 times progress of pH.Can be
Reacted under 30 DEG C or higher of temperature conditionss, such as 40 DEG C or higher.When reaction is being carried out at a temperature of 80 DEG C, substrate
Fructose may easily undergo brown stain.Therefore, reaction can be carried out under 40~80 DEG C of temperature conditionss, such as 50~75 DEG C, 60
Carried out under~75 DEG C or 68~75 DEG C of temperature conditionss. 
 In addition, the longer reaction time causes higher psicose conversion ratio.Recommendation makes reaction carry out 1 hour or more
It is long, such as 2 hours or longer, 3 hours or longer, 4 hours or longer, 5 hours or longer or 6 hours or longer.It is preferable, however, that
Reaction time was arranged in 48 hours, this be due to when reacted between when extending more than 48 hours, the conversion ratio of psicose
Incrementss become small or are likely to reduced.Therefore the reaction time could be arranged to 1~48 hour, 2~48 hours, 3~48 hours,
4~48 hours, 5~48 hours or 6~48 hours.In view of industry and economic aspect, the reaction time can fall small 1~48
When, 2~36 hours, 3~24 hours, 3~12 hours or in the range of 3~6 hours, but be not restricted to this.In order that fructose is extremely
The conversion ratio of psicose maximizes and selects the condition. 
 In addition, when recombinant cell is used to produce in the method for psicose, the concentration of recombinant cell could be arranged to
5mg (dcw in whole reactant mixture：Stem cell weight)/ml or higher, such as 5~100mg (dcw)/ml, 10~90mg
(dcw)/ml, 20~80mg (dcw)/ml, 30~70mg (dcw)/ml, 40~60mg (dcw)/ml or 45~55mg (dcw)/
ml.If the concentration of cell mass be less than lower limit, display difference or almost without psicose activity of conversion.In the opposing party
Face, the concentration more than the upper limit means that cell is crowded, and the cell is likely to act as excellent to the whole conversion ratio of psicose
The obstruction of change. 
 Zymoprotein (such as psicose epimerase) with psicose activity of conversion can show metalloenzyme
Characteristic, the activity of the zymoprotein is by metal ion control.Therefore, the presence of metal ion can promote by zymoprotein be catalyzed it is anti-
Should, thus improve the productivity ratio of psicose. 
 Therefore, it may further include metal ion for producing the composition of psicose.For producing psicose
Method may further include addition metal ion.In one embodiment, can be in culture processing procedure by gold
Category ion is added to culture medium or metal ion can be added during incubation 
 In another embodiment, metal ion can be added to the mixing of fructose or fructose and corynebacterium
The holder (before addition D-Fructose) that thing can be fixed metal ion added to zymoprotein, or added to zymoprotein institute
The mixture of fixed holder, or added to in the mixture of D-Fructose or individually with D-Fructose together with add. 
 Can aid in the improved metal ion of productivity ratio of psicose can select free copper ion, manganese ion, calcium from
The group that son, magnesium ion, zinc ion, nickel ion, cobalt ions, iron ion, aluminium ion and its any combination are constituted.For example, can make
With any of magnesium ion and cobalt ions or both.Productivity ratio in view of improving psicose, can be with 0.5mM or more
Amount add metal ion when the amount of metal ion is more than 5mM, with surplus amount compared with, the effect of addition is inapparent.
So the amount of metal ion is set into 5mM or less.For example with 0.5mM~5mM, such as 0.5mM~2mM amount uses metal
Ion 
 As long as setting up the active environment of the zymoprotein for keeping bacterial strain for a long time or being produced by bacterial strain, so that it may so that
With being configured to bacterial strain or zymoprotein fixing any holder on the support.For example, mosanom can be used as holder.Algae
Sour sodium is the naturally occurring gluey polysaccharide largely found in the cell membrane of brown alga, by beta-D-mannuronic acid and the ancient Lip rivers of α-L-
Uronic acid is constituted, therebetween with covalent β 1-4 keys.Because linear polymer makes bacterial strain or enzyme be stably fixed to thereon, linearly
Polymer is favourable for the productivity ratio of psicose. 
 In one embodiment, 1.5~4.0% (w/v) solution of sodium alginate (such as alginic acid sodium water solution), e.g., from about
2.5% (w/v) solution of sodium alginate can be used for fixing bacterial strain.For example, making the cell mass of bacterial strain, containing the enzyme produced by bacterial strain
Nutrient solution or the lysate of bacterial strain mixed with the alginic acid sodium water solution of 1~2 volume, then will using syringe pump and vavuum pump
0.2M ionic calcium solns instill mixture, form the cell mass, the culture containing the enzyme produced by bacterial strain or bacterial strain of bacterial strain
The pearl that lysate is fixed.Use typical method, such as dialysis, precipitation, absorption, electrophoresis, affinity chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography
Method, can purify enzyme by the lysate of bacterial strain, the culture of bacterial strain or bacterial strain. 
 Produce the reaction of the method bag zymoprotein and D-Fructose of psicose.In one embodiment, by making enzyme egg
The reaction between zymoprotein and D-Fructose can be carried out by being contacted in vain with D-Fructose. 
 In one embodiment, it is anti-between zymoprotein and fructose by making zymoprotein contact with fructose can to carry out
Should.In another embodiment, for example, by making zymoprotein be mixed with fructose or making fructose and the enzyme being fixed on holder
Albumen is contacted, and carries out the contact between zymoprotein and fructose.In further embodiment, by the culture containing fructose
The cell mass of recombinant cell is cultivated in base, the reaction between zymoprotein and fructose can be carried out.The reaction of zymoprotein and fructose is led
The conversion from D-Fructose to psicose is caused, so as to produce psicose by D-Fructose. 
 Production psicose method in, in the reactive mixture with 0.001mg/ml~1.0mg/ml concentration, with
0.005mg/ml~1.0mg/ml concentration, with 0.01mg/ml~1.0mg/ml concentration, 0.01mg/ml~0.1mg/ml
Concentration or when using zymoprotein with 0.05mg/ml~0.1mg/ml concentration, can bring efficiency for the production of psicose.When
During using zymoprotein less than the concentration of lower limit, the conversion ratio of psicose is probably difference.On the other hand, the mistake of zymoprotein
High concentration reduces the industrial economics of psicose production. 
 In order to effectively produce psicose in the method, with the reactive mixture 40~75% (w/v) concentration,
Such as 50~75% (w/v) concentration uses the fructose as substrate.In this manner, the concentration lower than the lower limit of fructose can subtract
The economic feasibility of few psicose.On the other hand, if fructose higher than the concentration of the upper limit to exist, it is more difficult to dissolving.Cause
This, concentration is preferably at the form that fructose within the scope of this can be buffer soln or the aqueous solution (such as distilled water). 
 By considering the optimum reaction condition of zymoprotein, reaction pH, temperature and enzyme concentration can be adjusted.For example, reaction pH
Can be 6~9, or reaction temperature can be 30 DEG C or higher, such as 40 DEG C or higher, because when reaction is at 80 DEG C or higher
At a temperature of when carrying out, substrate fructose may easily undergo brown stain in addition, the longer reaction time causes higher turn of psicose
Rate is due to the heat endurance (at 50 DEG C) of enzyme, and recommendation makes reaction carry out 1 hour or longer, when reacted between more than 8 hours when,
Its conversion ratio to psicose does not have any remarkable effect, or can reduce conversion ratio.Therefore, the reaction time is preferably 8 small
When, or be shorter than 8 hours. 
 When recombinant cell is used to produce the method for psicose, its concentration could be arranged in whole reactant mixture
5mg(dcw：Stem cell weight)/ml or higher. 
 In one embodiment, it can include making fructose and expression psicose poor for producing the method for psicose
To the recombinant cell of isomerase or the step of be isolated from the psicose epimerism enzyme reaction of recombinant cell.In a kind of embodiment party
