 [chemical formula 1] 
 
 
 
 2.2. the building of the stereochemical structure model of enzyme A 
 (1) building of the stereochemical structure model of enzyme A is carried out by homologous modeling 
 By homologous modeling, tied based on having been determined using X ray analysis of crystal structure with the solid of the complex of coenzyme TPP
The 1-deoxy-D- from Deinococcus radiodurans (Deinococcus radiodurans, D.radiodurans) of structure
The stereochemical structure (PDB ID:2O1X) [3] (Fig. 2) of xylurose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS, template), constructs
The stereochemical structure model of enzyme A. 
 Homologous modeling is compared based on the stereochemical structure of enzyme A and formwork structure to carry out (Fig. 3 A, 3B). 
 The amino acid consistent degree of the enzyme A and DXS from D.radiodurans is 44.1%.In the solid of the DXS of template
In structure, the region (44 residue) of 199~242 residue of amino acid number is unordered (disordered), can not pass through X-ray crystal
Structural analysis determines the position of atom.Therefore, constructing comparable 196~238 residue of disordered regions of removing and enzyme A, (43 is residual
Base) other than 7~630 residue of amino acid residue number stereochemical structure model.Then, by by the stereochemical structure model of enzyme A with
Formwork structure overlapping, is embedded in TPP and Mg, has made the compound body Model of enzyme A and TPP.Fig. 4, which is shown, is built into formwork structure
Model structure. 
 Enzyme A and formwork structure have been identically formed homodimer, have TPP binding site and Binding Capacity in each subunit
Position.The monomer of enzyme A is by structural domain I (1~319 residue), domain II (320~495 residue), Domain III (496~629
Residue) this 3 structural domains compositions. 
 (2) production of the substrate complex model of enzyme A 
 In order to speculate and the relevant amino acid residue of the combination of the substrate of enzyme A, constructs substrate and answered with what enzyme A was combined into
Fit model.In formwork structure 2O1X, due to that can not determine the coordinate of substrate pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, first
First, in order to detect pyruvic acid binding site, based on from similar saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
S.cerevisiae the stereochemical structure that transketolase (Transketolase, TK) and ethoxy-TPP intermediate) is combined into
(PDB ID:1GPU) [6] are overlapped with the compound body Model of pyruvic acid addition ethoxy-TPP intermediate made of coenzyme TPP,
To be embedded in ethoxy-TPP intermediate, compound body Model has been made.Similarly, based on from S.cerevisiae TK with
The stereochemical structure (PDB ID:1NGS) [7] of erythrose-4-phosphate is embedded in erythrose-4-phosphate, and then according to erythrose -4- phosphorus
Acid production glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate model, has thus made the compound body Model of enzyme A and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. 
 Fig. 5 shows the model structure of enzyme A and substrate complex. 
 2.3. the supposition of the active site of enzyme A 
 In order to estimate the amino acid residue for combining coenzyme and substrate, in the compound body Model of enzyme A and coenzyme, in TPP
The interaction of mesosome, GAP and Mg is studied. 
 (1) binding site of coenzyme TPP 
 It is same as formwork structure in the compound body Model of enzyme A and TPP, TPP between structural domain I and domain II,
The pyrimidine ring of TPP is in conjunction with domain II, and phosphate is in conjunction with structural domain I. 
 TPP constitutes (Fig. 6) by aminopyrimidine ring, thiazoline ring, pyrophosphoric acid.Aminopyrimidine ring to be contained in enzyme A's just
Mode inside binding pocket combines.The side chain of Phe396 and Ile369 is in a manner of from sandwich aminopyrimidine ring by dredging
Aqueous interaction combines.It can speculate that especially the cyclic phenyl of the side chain of Phe396 is brought with aminopyrimidine ring for pi accumulation
Strong combination.The oxygen of the side chain of the oxygen and Glu371 of the main chain of Gly120 and 1 nitrogen-atoms of aminopyrimidine ring form hydrogen bond.
1 nitrogen-atoms of the pyrimidine ring of known TPP, which reacts the catalysis carried out by TPP with the hydrogen bond of Glu residue, to be important,
It is preserved by using TPP as the enzyme of coenzyme.It may be speculated that the side chain of Arg399 not only passes through hydrophobic bond, but also pass through
Binding pocket is formd with the hydrogen bond of the side chain of neighbouring amino acid residue Glu371, Ser122.As the phase with thiazoline ring
Interaction observed and the hydrophobic bond of Ile184, Ile369.As the interaction with pyrophosphoric acid, can speculate
There is hydrogen bond between the side chain of the main chain of Gly152, the side chain of Lys285 and His79. 
 The combination of coenzyme TPP needs Mg.Mg is coordinated between 2 phosphates of TPP, can speculate Asp151 and Asn180
Side chain and Met182 main chain in conjunction with Mg.For DXS, it was known that as TPP combination die body, remain GDGX25-30N's
Sequence [3].It include the amino acid sequence Gly150-Asp151- for deducing the Asp151 and Asn180 of Mg combination in enzyme A
The sequence of Gly152-Asn180 is consistent with the die body. 
 As set forth above, it is possible to speculate, the hydrophobic residue of the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP and the carbon of thiazoline ring and enzyme A
There are hydrophobic interactions between Ile184, Ile369, Phe396, Arg399.In addition it may be speculated that the 2 of aminopyrimidine ring
A nitrogen-atoms and Gly120, Glu371 form hydrogen bond.Between pyrophosphoric acid, in addition to the hydrogen with His79, Gly152, Lys285
Other than key, also speculating has the hydrogen bond of the Mg formation by Asp151, Asn180, Met182.Fig. 7 shows tying with TPP for supposition
Close relevant amino acid residue. 
 (2) with the interaction of pyruvic acid 
 Pyruvic acid as substrate is reacted with TPP generates ethoxy-TPP intermediate.Among enzyme A and ethoxy-TPP
The compound body Model of body has the hydrophobicity with Val77 it may be speculated that as the interaction with the ethoxy from pyruvic acid
Interaction and the hydrogen bond with His432.It is considered that the combination of these amino acid residues and pyruvic acid is related.Fig. 8, which is shown, to be pushed away
Survey the amino acid residue with ethoxy interaction. 
 (3) with the interaction of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
 As the amino acid residue to interact with substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), can speculate have with His48,
The hydrogen bond (Fig. 9) of Tyr393, Arg421, Asp428, Arg479. 
 The aldehyde radical of His48 and Asp428 and GAP forms hydrogen bond.It can speculate Tyr393, Arg421, Arg479 and GAP
Phosphate forms hydrogen bond. 
 More than, the active site of supposition is shown in table 2~4. 
 [table 2] 
 Table 2. speculates the amino acid residue with the ethoxy-TPP intermediate interaction detected in enzyme A 
 
 
 
 [table 3] 
 Table 3. speculates the amino acid residue with the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate interaction detected in enzyme A 
 
 
 
 [table 4] 
 The amino acid residue of the binding site speculated in 4. enzyme A of table 
 
 
 
 In addition, by enzyme A and the combination of coenzyme TPP, the combination of enzyme A and pyruvic acid, enzyme A and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
The figure of combination be shown in Fig. 6,10,11. 
 Specific coenzyme has been obtained since enzyme A maintains to be incorporated in the DXS of the D.radiodurans of template
The active site of TPP, substrate pyruvate and GAP, therefore speculate the enzymatic activity with DXS.It is known that these amino acid residues are not only
In the DXS from D.radiodurans, the DXS in Escherichia coli etc., guarding in the TK from S.cerevisiae
Property also high [3]. 
 It is known in Escherichia coli DXS, will be equivalent to Glu370, Arg399, Arg479 of enzyme A amino acid residue replace
For [3] can be inactivated when Ala.In addition, described in document [8] the His48 for making the enzyme A for being equivalent to Escherichia coli DXS,
In the experiment of the amino acid residue mutation of Glu371, Asp428, all enzymes are substantially inactivated.It may be speculated that in enzyme A,
These amino acid residues are important the activity of DXS. 
 2.4. the mutation G225D bring of enzyme A influences 
 The mutation G225D of enzyme A is present in the disordered regions (196~238 residue) that can not determine stereochemical structure.In order to speculate
The mutation impacts the stereochemical structure of enzyme A, has investigated previous opinion, the position of disordered regions in stereochemical structure and work
The association at property position. 
 (1) about the mutation in known disordered regions 
 Currently, reporting the mutation occurred in disordered regions, each 2 portions for the DXS of muscat and Escherichia coli
Position, 4 kinds of total increase enzymatic activity. 
 For the DXS from muscat (Vitis vinifera), report K284N mutation bring with
Wild type increases about 2 times of activity compared to Vmax and Kcat/Km and the yield of monoterpene is significantly increased because of overexpression
[9]。 
 Additionally, it is known that in muscat there is the mutation of K213N and K234C in the mutation of K284N and R306C and Escherichia coli
The invention (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 2014-500710, US20130276166) of pass.The invention is related to the activity by improving DXS to increase
The method of the yield of terpenes, therefore 4 pass through the yield of the mutation increase terpenes of a residue respectively. 
 Figure 12 shows the position for increasing the mutation of enzyme A, Escherichia coli and the enzymatic activity in the DXS of muscat. 
 The K284N and R306C of muscat, the K213N and K234C of Escherichia coli are present in disordered regions (blue).
The mutation G225D of enzyme A also as them, is present in disordered regions.According to amino acid alignment, the active site of DXS is (green
Color) be it is conservative, can speculate enzyme A also has reactive mode identical with these DXS.It should be noted that the N of disordered regions
There are active sites for end side (magenta). 
 As described above, can speculate there are the mutation of multiple enzymatic activitys for improving DXS to local area in the disordered regions of DXS
Domain, which imports mutation, to cause certain influence to the activity of DXS. 
 (2) position of the mutation G225D (disordered regions) of enzyme A in stereochemical structure 
 Disordered regions (196~238 residue) position that there is mutation G225D in enzyme A is shown in Figure 13 with the dotted line of blue
It sets. 
 One's respective area is located near the binding site of coenzyme TPP necessary to the activity of DXS.The ring of the N-terminal side of one's respective area
There is Asn180, Met182 and Ile184 as active site in (magenta).The side chain of Asn180 and the main chain of Met182
In conjunction with Mg.The side chain and TPP hydrophobic bonding of Ile184.It is believed that in order to tie TPP necessary to the activity of DXS and Mg
It closes, which takes structure appropriate to be important.Document has carried out following investigation in [9]: although physiological action is unknown, local area
Domain is present near active site, and the mutation in one's respective area may reasonably influence the activity of enzyme.As shown in Figure 12,13, local area
Domain is present near TPP binding site on amino acid sequence, in stereochemical structure, it is understood that prominent in one's respective area
It is that may very occur that change, which impacts these active sites,. 
 (3) preparation of the model of the disordered regions of enzyme A and mutation G225D enzyme 
 Then, in order to which the mutation G225D of studying enzyme A is influenced caused by the stereochemical structure of disordered regions, for enzyme A's
The disordered regions of 196~238 residues (43 residue) have made model structure.About the mutation K284N of muscat, in report
In document [9], model is made for the disordered regions of muscat DXS, observed the variation of electrostatic potential caused by mutation.In order to
With reference to having carried out same analysis to enzyme A.By homologous modeling, with the amino acid sequence high with the disordered regions homology of enzyme A
Fragment structure based on made stereochemical structure model.As formwork structure, have in the stereochemical structure for having used PDB to include
The 1AL7 segment of highest amino acid consistent degree (34%).It can speculate that disordered regions take the structure waved, as one's respective area
Folding easy to form can be as reference.The model of production is shown in Figure 14 (left side). 
 In addition, having made the stereochemical structure model of mutation G225D enzyme by the way that the Gly225 of mutable site is substituted by Asp.
Gly225 is located at surface, passes through the substitution to Asp, the side chain exposing surface of Asp.To the surface shape of the stereochemical structure model of production
Shape describes electrostatic potential, shows the result in Figure 14 (right side).Blue indicates positive (positive charge) region, and red indicates negative
(negative electrical charge) region. 
 It has been confirmed that there are the regions of strong positive charge in wild type, but positive charge dies down in mutation G225D enzyme, bears
Charge enhancing.In wild type, Arg227, Arg228, Lys230, K234 side chains aggregate with positive charge are formd strong just
The region of charge.It is considered that this is because, by being substituted by uncharged Gly225 present in the region with negative
Positive charge near the Asp of charge, Asp225 weakens.The mutation K284N's of muscat shown in the result and document [9]
Electrostatic potential variation, the electrostatic potential variation i.e. with the surface of disordered regions from positive charge to negative electrical charge show identical tendency.It can
With prediction, the structure change of disordered regions caused by the G225D of enzyme A is caused to the active site comprising TPP binding site and musk deer
The identical influence of the mutation of preserved fragrant grape is prompted due to the influence, the mutant G225D of enzyme A also with the mutant of muscat
K284N similarly increases enzymatic activity. 
 2.5. in chemical activators path enzyme A mutation G225D influence 
 As described above, it is thus identified that the disordered regions in enzyme A occur for the mutation G225D of enzyme A, and one's respective area is present in activity must
Near the TPP binding site needed.In addition, the mutation of multiple enzymatic activitys for improving DXS has been had now been found that in one's respective area, it can be pre-
It surveys, with the active known mutations for improving DXS same structure change occurs for the mutation of G225D. 
 According to the position of the disordered regions using stereochemical structure model validation, it is believed that at least as described in document, by unordered
The mutation in region brings certain influence to the bond area TPP, to improve enzymatic activity.In the example of muscat, pass through
External zymetology experiment shows that the Kcat/Km of mutant is about 2 times of wild type, can predict that the mutation in disordered regions is brought
It is more suitable for the structure change of TPP combination. 
 In order to which intracellular various monoterpene are significantly increased, need to increase the isopentenylpyrophosphate as monoterpene raw material
(IPP).It has been reported that feedback inhibition of the DXS by the product IPP in deoxy-D-xylulose sugar path, IPP and TPP Competitive assays
[10].In addition, it is known that the initial enzyme DXS in deoxy-D-xylulose sugar path is caused to inhibit when the amount of IPP is a certain amount of above, into
Row controls so that IPP is no more than the amount. 
 By the feedback inhibition, the amount of the IPP of supply by DXS control be it is a certain amount of, therefore, in the enzyme for increasing only DXS
When active Kcat/Km, the supply amount of IPP does not increase, and terpenes can not also be significantly increased.In known example, by unordered
The mutation in region increases the synthetic quantity of terpenes, can predict the supply amount that IPP is increased by the mutation, that is, prompted DXS
By IPP carry out feedback inhibition fail. 
 It is known that in vitro, IPP and TPP competition inhibit DXS [10] in conjunction with DXS.By the mutation in disordered regions,
Recurring structure variation in the bond area TPP not only forms and is suitable for the structure that TPP is combined, also affects to the combination of IPP, thus
Prompt may be failed by the feedback inhibition that IPP is carried out. 
 The mutation G225D of enzyme A is same, it may be speculated that by bringing structure change to make to pass through IPP in the bond area TPP
The feedback inhibition of progress fails, to increase the yield of IPP.It is believed that as a result, being used as astaxanthin by increasing
The supply amount of the IPP of synthesis material increases the synthetic quantity (Figure 15) of astaxanthin. 
 3. the building of the stereochemical structure model of enzyme C and the analysis of mutant 
 According to the homology of amino acid sequence and stereochemical structure comparative analysis, enzyme C is polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase
One kind, be to synthesize the ten of ten polyisoprene pyrophosphoric acids by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and 7 isopentenylpyrophosphates (IPP)
Polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase: Decaprenyl diphosphate synthase. 
 According to the stereochemical structure model of the enzyme C of building, caused by the mutation A305V that genome analysis is identified because near
Amino acid residue atom collision caused by steric hindrance, can speculate that the stereochemical structure of enzyme C becomes unstable.Pass through
Making the activity of enzyme C because of the destabilization of stereochemical structure reduces, and is reduced by the amount of the enzyme C FPP consumed and IPP.It is believed that it
As a result, it is possible to which the amount of FPP, IPP for chemical activators increase, therefore the yield of astaxanthin increases. 
 3.1. the enzyme reaction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase 
 Decaprenyl diphosphate synthase has the activity for being condensed FPP and IPP, is the contracting being repeated with IPP
Conjunction, the enzyme that ten polyisoprene pyrophosphoric acids (DPP) are synthesized by FPP and 7 IPP.By decaprenyl diphosphate synthase
Enzyme reaction is shown in following. 
 [chemical formula 2] 
 
 
 
 3.2. the building of the stereochemical structure model of enzyme C 
 (1) building of the stereochemical structure model of enzyme C is carried out by homologous modeling 
 In order to influence caused by the active site of studying enzyme C and mutation, amino acid consistent degree in the stereochemical structure of PDB is used
Highest (amino acid consistent degree be 76.2%) and by X ray analysis of crystal structure determined stereochemical structure from pod membrane
The stereochemical structure of red bacterium (Rhodobacter capsulatus, R.capsulatus) decaprenyl diphosphate synthase
(PDB ID:3MZV) is used as formwork structure, constructs stereochemical structure model (Figure 16) [4] by homologous modeling. 
 Stereochemical structure based on enzyme C and formwork structure, which compares, has carried out homologous modeling (Figure 17). 
 (2) production of the substrate complex model of enzyme C 
 Since formwork structure 3MZV is not bound with substrate, using from Escherichia coli's
Octaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (eight polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetases) (PDB ID:3WJN, 3WJO)
Stereochemical structure data [11], the stereochemical structure model of 3WJN and enzyme C overlaps, substrate FPP is embedded in the stereochemical structure mould of enzyme C
Thus type has made the compound body Model of enzyme C and FPP.Then, similarly overlap 3WJO, be embedded in IPP, made enzyme C and FPP,
The compound body Model of IPP. 
 Figure 18 shows the model structure for being configured to formwork structure.Enzyme C has formed homologous dimerization identical with formwork structure
Body. 
 3.3. about enzyme C 
 (1) based on the comparison of stereochemical structure 
 Enzyme C decaprenyl diphosphate synthase belongs to polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase family (Pfam
PF00348Polyprenyl synthetase).The form of enzyme C bound substrates is shown in Figure 19. 
 Polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase is with headtotail (head-to-tail) (here, according to document [4], by phosphorus
Acidic group side is known as head (head), and prenyl side is known as tail (tail)) direction IPP is condensed from FPP, synthesize various poly-
Isoprenoid.Decaprenyl diphosphate synthase makes isoamyl by the condensation reaction of persistently progress FPP and IPPG
Diene extends to the inside (being shown on the right side of Figure 19 with arrow) of substrate-binding site, synthesizes the ten polyisoprene pyrophosphoric acids of C50. 
 The ammonia of enzyme C and the decaprenyl diphosphate synthase from template R.Capsulatus (Rhodobacter capsulatus)
Base acid consistent degree is up to 76.3%, and active site also remains (Figure 17).Stereochemical structure C α overlapping RMSD be 2 enzymes are very similar, if distinguishing the consistency for indicating amino acid residue, the kind of amino acid residue by color
The different region of class is limited to molecular surface, active site, bound substrates region (figure is all made of consistent amino acid residue
20)。 
 (2) based on the comparison of amino acid sequence 
 Then, the amino acid sequence of enzyme C has been carried out and the ten poly- isoamyls from Paracoccus (paracoccus)
The comparison of diene pyrophosphate synthetase.As the decaprenyl diphosphate synthase from Paracoccus, UniProt
It has been included in (http://www.uniprot.org) and (has produced maize from Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens
Plain pair coccus) (Q8L1I6) and Paracoccus denitrificans (Paracoccus denitrificans) (A1B3M9) amino acid sequence work
For specific amino acid sequence.They are compared with the amino acid sequence of enzyme C, the result is that amino acid consistent degree is
75.1% (similar degree 89.2%) shows high homology (table 5). 
 It can also speculate that enzyme C is decaprenyl diphosphate synthase according to amino acid sequence.Ratio is shown in Figure 21
It is right. 
 5. enzyme C of table is compared with the amino acid sequence of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase 
 
 
 
 3.4. the supposition of the active site of enzyme C 
 In the compound body Model of enzyme C and substrate, thus it is speculated that substrate FPP binding site and IPP binding site, catalysis must
The Mg binding site needed.According in the activity of the active site of these results presumptions and other polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetases
The heart, the conservative of substrate-binding site are high, can speculate that enzyme C has the side of reaction identical with polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase
Formula. 
 The compound body Model of enzyme C and substrate is shown in Figure 22. 
 It can speculate that enzyme C and formwork structure decaprenyl diphosphate synthase are identically formed homodimer.Figure
The binding site with FPP and IPP of A chain (light red) is shown in 22.FPP is in conjunction with the tunnel-like region of A chain, FPP and IPP
It is combined in the form of the phosphate of FPP towards the headtotail (head-to-tail) of the isopentene group of IPP.In the presence of Mg,
Catalysis occurs between the phosphate of FPP and the isopentene group of IPP to react. 
 In order to speculate the active site of enzyme C, in enzyme C and substrate complex model, detect to be present near FPP, IPP
Amino acid residue, thus it is speculated that the interaction of substrate and amino acid residue.For FPP, can speculate phosphate with
There is hydrogen bond, between polyisopreneyl and Ala88, Thr89, His92, Phe125 between Arg102, Lys179, Lys244
With hydrophobic interaction (on Figure 23). 
 For IPP, can speculate has hydrogen bond between phosphate and Lys54, Arg57, His86, Arg103, in isoamyl
There is hydrophobic interaction (center Figure 23) between alkenyl and Phe216. 
 Mg is needed in this catalysis reaction.As Mg binding site, in known polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase
Know the DDXXD die body [11] at 2 positions.In formwork structure, the coordinate of Mg is not determined, but in enzyme C, is equivalent to DDXXD
Asp93, Asp94, Asp97 and Asp220 of die body, Asp221, Asp224 and known Mg binding site are such present in phosphorus
Near acidic group, it can speculate these amino acid residues in conjunction with Mg (under Figure 23). 
 More than, the active site of supposition is shown in the table 6~8 of auxiliary information.In addition, by about enzyme C's and FPP and IPP
The figure of combination and the combination of enzyme C and Mg is shown in Figure 24,25. 
 [table 6] 
 Table 6. speculates the amino acid residue with FPP and the IPP interaction detected in enzyme C 
 
 
 
 [table 7] 
 Table 7. speculates the amino acid residue with the Mg interaction detected in enzyme C 
 
 
 
 [table 8] 
 The amino acid residue of the active site speculated in 8. enzyme C of table 
 
 
 
 Speculate each amino acid residue for being combined with as formwork structure from R.capsulatus, (pod membrane is red thin
Bacterium) decaprenyl diphosphate synthase be consistent (Figure 17).In addition, the FPP binding site of enzyme C, the engaging portion IPP
The eight polyisoprene pyrophosphoric acids from E.coli that position, Mg binding site maintain for making substrate complex model close
At the binding site of enzyme, it is understood that enzyme C has reactive mode identical with eight polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetases. 
 Especially it is believed that Arg102, Lys179, Lys244 in conjunction with the phosphate of FPP and in conjunction with Mg
Asp93, Asp94, Asp97, Asp220, Asp221, Asp224 are and directly related important of the transfer catalytic activity of phosphate
Residue.It is reported in the experiment that the mutant of production rat, the farnesyl diphosphate synthase of yeast carries out: the phosphoric acid engaging portion as enzyme C
Position Arg102, Arg103 and as Mg binding site Asp94, Asp97, Asp220, Asp221, Asp224 and quite
Amino acid residue it is critically important for enzymatic activity；These amino acid residue height are protected between polyisoprene pyrophosphate synthetase
Keep [14,15]. 
 In addition, being equivalent to the mutation of the amino acid residue of Phe216, Gln217 of enzyme C by preparing in farnesyl diphosphate synthase
Body specifies that the side chain of Phe and Gln is critically important [16] for Binding Capacity.In the compound body Model of enzyme C, Phe216,
Gln217 is located at the region of active site, can predict critically important for activity. 
 3.5. the mutation A305V bring of enzyme C influences 
 In order to speculate mutation influence for caused by stereochemical structure of the slave Ala305 to Val in enzyme C by identification, production
The stereochemical structure model of the mutation A305V enzyme of enzyme C. 
 (1) preparation for the catastrophic model that the mono- residue of A305V replaces 
 In order to observe influence caused by the substitution from Ala to Val, firstly, the stereochemical structure of other amino acid residues is consolidated
The mono- residue of Ala305 is substituted by model made of Val, is compared with wild type by fixed (assuming that rigid body), production. 
 Wild type is shown in Figure 26 and is mutated the stereochemical structure model of A305V enzyme.The Ala305 of wild type is present in α spiral shell
It revolves (pink), side chain and the amino acid residue of adjacent α spiral (magenta) are stacked by hydrophobic interaction. 
 The structure of the amino acid residue adjacent with Ala305 is shown in Figure 27. 
 The carbon atom of the methyl of side chain as Ala305 and neighbouring amino acid residue, Tyr208, Ala211,
His301, Ala302 connect, and the interatomic distance of carbon is below Pass through the substitution from Ala305 to Val, the first of side chain
It is 2 that base, which increases,.Ala305 is being substituted by stereochemical structure model made of Val, the carbon of the methyl of the side chain of Val with
The interatomic distance of the carbon of Tyr208 and Ala211 is     
 The limit lower limit value of the contact distance of non-covalent bond between carbon is Due to the carbon that is measured in Val305
Interatomic distance is lower than the value, it is understood that these carbon atoms collide, generates the sky with neighbouring amino acid residue
Between steric hindrance.It has been confirmed that interatomic distance is shorter than van der Waals radius in the display of Spece-filling mode, atom it
Between collided.According to above it is expected that the mutation of A305V causes by atomic collision the steric hindrance of enzyme C, cause
Stereochemical structure it is unstable. 
 (2) variation of internal energy of molecular caused by A305V is mutated 
 In order to evaluate structural instability caused by A305V, according to interatomic key length, bond angle, distortion, key
The total of energy etc., calculates the wild type of enzyme C and the internal energy of molecular of mutant A305V with kilojoule/mol (KJ/mol) unit. 
 As a result, -17 relative to wild type, 912 (KJ/mol), mutation A305V enzyme is -16,295 (KJ/mol),
The internal energy of molecular of mutation A305V increases 9.02%, it is thus identified that structural instability.The increase of the internal energy of molecular especially can be
Each amino acid residue of Tyr208, Ala211, Val305 are confirmed, it is believed that collision, which has occurred, in these amino acid residues is
The reason of internal energy of molecular increases.The wild type of enzyme C is shown in Figure 28 compared with the internal energy of molecular of mutant A305V. 
 (3) it is mutated structure change caused by A305V 
 Then, for Mutant models carry out energy minimize calculate, for can by change near amino acid it is residual
The stereochemical structure of base is studied to avoid colliding caused by A305V.As a result, the side chain in order to avoid Val305 collides
And allow side chain, it is necessary to change the stereochemical structure of the amino acid residue of the α spiral there are the α spiral of Val305 and adjoining.That is, should
Structure change is directed not only to side chain, further relates to main chain, it is envisioned that in mutation A305V enzyme, can not be formed between α spiral originally
Stacking, the structure near 2 spirals becomes unstable.In addition, exist in the α spiral adjacent with mutation A305V with the bottom of as
The active site (Phe216, Gln217, Asp220) that IPP, Mg of object are combined.It is believed that due to as active site basis
α helical backbones structure structure change, the amino acid residue of active site can not obtain the position of script, as a result, the bottom of to
Object combines, activity impacts (Figure 29 is right) in itself. 
 Figure 29 shows wild type and energy minimizes near the Ala305 and Val305 of the mutant A305V after calculating
Structure, Figure 30,31,32 show the structure change of mutant A305V. 
 (4) enzyme C activity caused by structural instability reduces 
 As described above, the stereochemical structure model according to A305V can speculate the sky having occurred with neighbouring amino acid residue
Between steric hindrance, the increase of internal energy of molecular and 2 adjacent α spirals structure change, prompted the mutation of A305V to make standing for enzyme C
Body structure becomes unstable.The stereochemical structure caused by point mutation is unstable, there is a large amount of reports in hereditary disease etc..It can examine
Consider have for example, there is the stereochemical structure for causing the protein of the mutation of destabilization that can not keep script in a solvent and than logical
Inactivation in the often short time, or the mutein that can not be stacked originally in the cell are arranged by the function of cell itself
It removes.Therefore it is excluded in bacterium it may be speculated that not having active and mutation A305V enzyme for unstable structure originally and having
A possibility that, the result is that the activity of the enzyme C in bacterium reduces. 
 3.6. the effect of the mutation A305V of the enzyme C in chemical activators path 
 Decaprenyl diphosphate synthase is one of the enzyme of coenzyme C10 (CoQ10) synthesis path.It is this time bright
Really, it is thus identified that with enzyme C with high homology from Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens or Paracoccus
The decaprenyl diphosphate synthase of denitrificans is necessary enzyme [the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 2005- for generating CoQ10
211020, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 2006-517794].The FPP and IPP of substrate as decaprenyl diphosphate synthase, and
Geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate (the Geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate in chemical activators path；GGPP) synzyme
CrtE substrate.It is understood that in intracellular, the decaprenyl diphosphate synthase of common Paracoccus
The FPP and IPP used as substrate are competed with CrtE. 
 It may be speculated that the mutation A305V in enzyme C by identification makes enzyme and making the stereochemical structure of molecule become unstable
The activity of C reduces.It is believed that the amount of the substrate FPP and IPP that use also are reduced when the activity of enzyme C reduces, as a result,
The amount of FPP, IPP for being able to use in chemical activators path increase. 
 CrtE synthesizes 1 molecule GGPP from 1 molecule FPP and 1 molecule IPP.On the other hand, the poly- isoamyl of 1 molecule ten is synthesized in enzyme C
In diene pyrophosphoric acid, 1 molecule FPP and 7 molecule IPP are needed.In terms of IPP, enzyme C consumes 7 times of the IPP of CrtE in 1 reaction.
It is understood that the activity reduction of enzyme C is extremely effective to the IPP that chemical activators path supplies for increasing. 
 It may be speculated that as a result, the synthetic quantity of astaxanthin dramatically increases (Figure 33).
