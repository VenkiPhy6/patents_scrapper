 This application is a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2018/077882, filed internationally on Oct. 12, 2018, which claims the benefit of European Application No. 17197098.1, filed Oct. 18, 2017. 
 The present invention relates to active compound combinations comprising firstly at least one compound of formula (I) as shown below and secondly and at least one active compound of group (II) selected from (a) Insecticide Groups (IRAC (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee) mode of action classification groups; also designated as “IRAC classification groups”) (1), (12), (20), (21) and (30), (b) compounds of formula (IIa) or (IIb) as shown below, and (c) Biological Control Agent (BCA) Groups (1), (2) and (7). Such combinations are highly suitable for controlling animal and microbial pests, such as unwanted insects, especially acarids (mites), nematodes and as plant strengthening agents. 
 BACKGROUND 
 The compound of formula (I) and methods for its production are known from WO 2013/092350 and its insecticidal action has been described. 
 However, the acaricidal and/or insecticidal efficacy and/or the activity spectrum and/or the compatibility of the known compounds with plants, especially with respect to crop plants, is not always satisfactory. Therefore, novel active compound combinations with improved properties are in great demand. 
 It has now been found that an active compound combination comprising at least one compound of the formula (I) 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 and at least one active compound of group (II) which is selected from
         (a) Insecticide Groups (IRAC classification groups) (1), (12), (20), (21) and (30), or   (b) compounds of formula (IIa) or (IIb), or   (c) Biological Control Agent (BCA) Groups (1), (2) and (7),       
 is highly suitable for the control of animal and microbial pests as well as plant strengthening agent. Especially, such active compound combinations have very good insecticidal, acaricidal and nematicidal properties. 
 In formula (I), the crossed double bond indicates that E- or Z-isomers of the compound are possible, i.e. the 5-membered ring might be present in two different orientations. According to the invention, the compound of formula (I) can be present in form of its E-isomer or in form of its Z-isomer or in form of a mixture of both E- and Z-isomers. 
 Such active compound combinations are very suitable for controlling animal and microbial pests such as insects and/or arachnids, especially acarids, and/or nematodes and/or fungi, and indirectly improve plant health. Further, such active compound combinations can be used for reducing overall damage of plants and plant parts as well as losses in harvested fruits or vegetables caused by such pests, e.g. insects, mites and phytopathogens. Further, such active compound combinations are suitable as plant strengthening agents. 
 Surprisingly, the insecticidal effect and/or arachnicidal/acaricidal effect and/or nematicidal effect and/or antimicrobial effect and/or the fungicidal effect and/or the plant-strengthening effect and/or the yield-increasing effect of the active compound combinations according to the invention is substantially higher than the sum of the effects of the individual active ingredients. There is an unpredictable real synergistic effect and not just a complementary/additive effect. 
 The active compound combinations according to the invention preferably comprise the compound of formula (I) and the compound of group (II) in synergistically effective amounts. Group II consists of 
 (a) Insecticide Groups (IRAC (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee) mode of action classification groups; also designated as “IRAC classification groups”) (1), (12), (20), (21) and (30), 
 (b) compounds of formula (IIa) or (IIb) as shown below, and 
 (c) Biological Control Agent (BCA) Groups (1), (2) and (7).

 The mixing ratios are based on weight ratios. The ratio is to be understood as meaning active compound of the formula (I) : an active compound of group (II). 
 Mixing Ratio BCA 
 The compounds of the formula (I) and the biological control agent (group II(c)) as defined above of the mixture or composition according to the invention can be combined in any specific ratio between these two mandatory components. A biological control agent is generally provided in form of a carrier such as a solution or powder or suspension comprising the biological control agent (e.g.in form of viable spores or conidia or an extract). In one preferred embodiment, the amount of viable spores or conidia per gramm compound of formula (I) in a mixture or composition according to the invention normally provided in/on a carrier is at least 10 7  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), such as between 10 7  and 10 14  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), more preferably at least 10 8  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), such as between between 10 8  and 5×10 13  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), or even more preferably at least 10 9  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), such as between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I). 
 The term “viability” of spores or conidia refers to the ability of spores or conidia to germinate at standard conditions and under sufficient supply of nutritions, water, light and/or further support such as growth media. Viability of spores and conidia can be easily determined by a person skilled in the art, e.g. by counting colonies formed by spores/conidia on a growth medium suitable for species to be tested. In addition, many assays are available in the art to determine viability of spores and/or conidia, e.g., Chen et al (Can. J. Plant Pathol., 24; 230-232 (2002); Paul et al (Biotech. And Bioengeneering, 42; 11-23 (1993); Panahiam et al (International Research Journal of Applied and Basic Science, 3(2); 292-298 (2012) or Laflamme et al (J. of applied Microbiol. 96; 684-692 (2004)). 
 In one preferred embodiment, wherein the biological control agent is a natural extract or simulated blend, the ratio is measured in view of the amount of biological active agent(s) in the extract or simulated blend. Thus, the ratio of an extract or simulated blend is based on the amount of active ingredient and not on the amount of the whole extract or blend. For example, a weight ratio of 1:1 of a compound according to formula (I) and a biological control agent (II) in form of a natural extract or simulated blend with 16.75% (w/w) active ingredient(s), such as terpenes, refers to a mixture or composition comprising, e.g., 1 g of a compound according to formula (I) and 5.97 g of the natural extract or simulated blend comprising 16.75% active ingredient(s) (biological control agent (II)), i.e. 1 g active ingredient(s) (biological control agent (II)) resulting in a 1:1 mixture in view of a compound of formual (I) and the active ingredient(s) (biological control agent (II)). 
 Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the mixing ratio in mixtures of a compound of formula (I) and natural extracts or simulated blend of, e.g.,  Chenopodium ambrosioides  is 1500:1 to 1:2000. Such as 1:1 to 1:2000 or 1:1 to 1:2000 or 1:1 to 1:1500 or 1:10 to 1:1500 or 1:1 to 1:250 or 1:5 to 1:100 or 1:10 to 1:25. One natural extract or simulated blend of  Chenopodium ambrosioides  is known as Requiem. The active ingredient(s) concentration in Requiem is 16.75% (w/w) terpenes, i.e. a mixture of α-terpinene, p-cymene and limonene. As outlined above, the weight ratio of a compound of formula (I) and active ingredient(s) of Requiem can be calculated by using the concentration of said active ingredients in the natural extract or simulated blend. The skilled person is aware how to calculate the concentration of, e.g., terpenes. Analytical methods are known from, e.g., Goren et al (0939D5075/2003/0900D0687 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen, (2003), http://www.znaturforsch.com); Kimball et al (J. of Chrom. Science, 42; 245-249 (2004), Davidowski, Perkin Elmer for the Better, http://www.perkinelmer.com/Content/applicationnotes/app_limoneneincitrusrindsbygcms.pdf 
 In another preferred embodiment, the mixing ratio in mixtures or compositions of a compound of formula (I) and fungi (which are, e.g. provided in form of a solution or solid form (e.g. a powder) with viable conidia and/or spores) is between 10 7  and 10 14  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 12  viable spores or conidia/g compound of formula (I). 
 For example, the ratio of viable conidia of  Metarhizium anisopliae  (e.g. Met 52, e.g., with a concentration of 5×10 9  viable conidia/g solid form carrier) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable conidia/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable conidia/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 12  viable conidia/g compound of formula (I) such as between 3×10 10  and 7×10 11  viable conidia/g compound of formula (I). 
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of  Paecilomyces fumosoroseus  (e.g. PreFeRal, for example with a concentration of 2×10 9  viable spores/g solution) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 11  and 3×10 12  viable spores/g compound of formula (I). 
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of  Beauveria bassiana  (e.g., Naturalis-L, for example with a concentration of 2.3×10 7  viable spores/ml solution) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 5×10 9  and 10 12  viable spores/g compound of formula (I) such as between 5×10 9  and 5×10 11  viable spores/g compound of formula (I). 
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of  Paecilomyces lilacinus  (e.g.,  Paecilomyces lilacinus  strain 251 (BioAct), for example with a concentration of 10 10  viable spores/g carrier) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 14  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 10  and 10 14  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 5×10 11  and 5×10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 12  and 5×10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I). 
 In another preferred embodiment, the mixing ratio in mixtures or compositions of a compound of formula (I) and bacteria (which are, e.g. provided in form of a solution or solid form (e.g. a powder) with viable spores) is between 10 7  and 10 14  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 12  viable spores/g compound of formula (I). 
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of  Bacillus thuringiensis  (e.g.,  B. thuringiensis  subsp.  aizawai  ABTS-1857 (XenTari), for example with a concentration of 1.5×10 7  viable spores/g carrier) per gr compound of formula (I) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 8  and 10 11  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 9  and 10 11  viable spores/g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 9  and 5×10 10  viable spores/g compound of formula (I). 
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of  Bacillus firmus  (including but not limited to strain CNCM I-1582, for example with a concentration of 1.5×10 7  viable spores/g carrier) per gr compound of formula (I) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 12  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 8  and 10 11  viable spores/g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 9  and 10 11  viable spores/g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 9  and 5×10 10  viable spores/g compound of formula (I). 
 Some particularly preferred mixing ratios for some specific combinations of the compound of formula (I) and a mixing partner of group (II(c)) are provided in table 2, wherein the mixing partner of group (II(c)) is used with a concentration/carrier or solution as described above. Thus, each individual active compound combination of a compound of formula (I) and the indicated mixing partner of group (II(c)) in each of the indicated mixing ratios is a preferred embodiment of the invention.

 Formulations 
 The present invention further relates to formulations and use forms prepared therefrom as pesticides, for example drench, drip and spray liquors, comprising an active compound combination according to the invention. In some cases, the use forms comprise further pesticides and/or adjuvants which improve action, such as penetrants, e.g. vegetable oils, for example rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, mineral oils, for example paraffin oils, alkyl esters of vegetable fatty acids, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, or alkanol alkoxylates and/or spreaders, for example alkylsiloxanes and/or salts, for example organic or inorganic ammonium or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate and/or retention promoters, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate or hydroxypropyl guar polymers and/or humectants, for example glycerol and/or fertilizers, for example ammonium-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilizers. 
 Customary formulations are, for example, water-soluble liquids (SL), emulsion concentrates (EC), emulsions in water (EW), suspension concentrates (SC, SE, FS, OD), water-dispersible granules (WG), granules (GR) and capsule concentrates (CS); these and further possible formulation types are described, for example, by Crop Life International and in Pesticide Specifications, Manual on development and use of FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides, FAO Plant Production and Protection Papers—173, prepared by the FAO/WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications, 2004, ISBN: 9251048576. The formulations, in addition to the active compound combination according to the invention, optionally comprise further agrochemically active compounds. 
 These are preferably formulations or use forms which comprise auxiliaries, for example extenders, solvents, spontaneity promoters, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, frost protectants, biocides, thickeners and/or further auxiliaries, for example adjuvants. An adjuvant in this context is a component which enhances the biological effect of the formulation, without the component itself having any biological effect. Examples of adjuvants are agents which promote retention, spreading, attachment to the leaf surface or penetration. 
 These formulations are prepared in a known way, for example by mixing the active compound combination according to the invention with auxiliaries such as, for example, extenders, solvents and/or solid carriers and/or other auxiliaries such as, for example, surfactants. The formulations are prepared either in suitable facilities or else before or during application. 
 The auxiliaries used may be substances suitable for imparting special properties, such as certain physical, technical and/or biological properties, to the formulation of the active compound combination according tot he invention, or to the use forms prepared from these formulations (for example ready-to-use pesticides such as spray liquors or seed dressing products). 
 Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzenes), the alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), the esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the unsubstituted and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulphones and sulphoxides (such as dimethyl sulphoxide), the carbonates and the nitriles. 
 If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, carbonates such as propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate or dibutyl carbonate, or nitriles such as acetonitrile or propanenitrile. 
 In principle, it is possible to use all suitable solvents. Examples of suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, chloroethylene or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, paraffins, petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, carbonates such as propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate or dibutyl carbonate, nitriles such as acetonitrile or propanenitrile, and also water. 
 In principle, it is possible to use all suitable carriers. Useful carriers include especially: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as finely divided silica, alumina and natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes and/or solid fertilizers. Mixtures of such carriers can likewise be used. Useful carriers for granules include: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and also granules of organic material such as sawdust, paper, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks. 
 Liquefied gaseous extenders or solvents can also be used. Particularly suitable extenders or carriers are those which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellant gases, such as halohydrocarbons, and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. 
 Examples of emulsifiers and/or foam-formers, dispersants or wetting agents with ionic or nonionic properties, or mixtures of these surfactants, are salts of polyacrylic acid, salts of lignosulphonic acid, salts of phenolsulphonic acid or naphthalenesulphonic acid, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, with substituted phenols (preferably alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic esters, taurine derivatives (preferably alkyl taurates), isethionate derivatives, phosphoric esters of polyethoxylated alcohols or phenols, fatty esters of polyols, and derivatives of the compounds containing sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, protein hydrolysates, lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. The presence of a surfactant is advantageous if at least one of the compounds of the active compound combination according to the invention and/or one of the inert carriers is insoluble in water and when the application takes place in water. 
 It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and nutrients and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc as further auxiliaries in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. 
 Additional components may be stabilizers, such as low-temperature stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers or other agents which improve chemical and/or physical stability. Foam formers or antifoams may also be present. 
 Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids may also be present as additional auxiliaries in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. Further possible auxiliaries are mineral and vegetable oils. 
 Optionally, further auxiliaries may be present in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. Examples of such additives include fragrances, protective colloids, binders, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrants, retention promoters, stabilizers, sequestrants, complexing agents, humectants, spreaders. In general, the active compound combination according tot he invention can be combined with any solid or liquid additive commonly used for formulation purposes. 
 Useful retention promoters include all those substances which reduce the dynamic surface tension, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate, or increase the viscoelasticity, for example hydroxypropylguar polymers. 
 Suitable penetrants in the present context are all those substances which are usually used for improving the penetration of agrochemical active compounds into plants. Penetrants are defined in this context by their ability to penetrate from the (generally aqueous) application liquor and/or from the spray coating into the cuticle of the plant and thereby increase the mobility of active compounds in the cuticle. The method described in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science 51, 131-152) can be used to determine this property. Examples include alcohol alkoxylates such as coconut fatty ethoxylate (10) or isotridecyl ethoxylate (12), fatty acid esters, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, fatty amine alkoxylates, for example tallowamine ethoxylate (15), or ammonium and/or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate. 
 The formulations preferably comprise between 0.00000001 and 98% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention or, with particular preference, between 0.01% and 95% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention, more preferably between 0.5% and 90% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention, based on the weight of the formulation. 
 The content of the compound of the active compound combination according to the invention in the use forms prepared from the formulations (in particular pesticides) may vary within wide ranges. The concentration of the active compound combination according to the invention in the use forms is usually between 0.00000001 and 95% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention, preferably between 0.00001 and 1% by weight, based on the weight of the use form. The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms. 
 Plants and Plant Parts 
 All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Here, plants are to be understood to mean all plants and plant parts such as wanted and unwanted wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants), for example cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya bean, potato, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, melon, carrot, watermelon, onion, lettuce, spinach, leek, beans,  Brassica oleracea  (e.g. cabbage) and other vegetable species, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape, and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant varieties which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. Plants should be understood to mean all developmental stages, such as seeds, seedlings, young (immature) plants up to mature plants. Plant parts should be understood to mean all parts and organs of the plants above and below ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples given being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds, and also tubers, roots and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants or harvested plant parts and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds. 
 Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compound combination according to the invention is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats. 
 As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and also parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term “parts” or “parts of plants” or “plant parts” has been explained above. The invention is used with particular preference to treat plants of the respective commercially customary cultivars or those that are in use. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having new properties (“traits”) and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, varieties, bio- or genotypes. 
 Transgenic Plant, Seed Treatment and Integration Events 
 The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated with preference in accordance with the invention include all plants which, through the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particular advantageous useful properties (“traits”) to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to levels of water or soil salinity, enhanced flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated ripening, higher yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage life and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are increased resistance of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, arachnids, nematodes, mites, slugs and snails owing, for example, to toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from  Bacillus thuringiensis  (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and also combinations thereof), furthermore increased resistance of the plants against phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses owing, for example, to systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and also resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example the “PAT” gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question may also be present in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetable, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), with particular emphasis being given to maize, soya beans, wheat, rice, potatoes, cotton, sugar cane, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of the plants to insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails. 
 Crop Protection—Types of Treatment 
 The treatment of the plants and plant parts with the compounds of the active compound combination according to the invention is carried out directly or by action on their surroundings, habitat or storage space using customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, atomizing, irrigating, evaporating, dusting, fogging, broadcasting, foaming, painting, spreading-on, injecting, watering (drenching), drip irrigating and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, furthermore as a powder for dry seed treatment, a solution for liquid seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for slurry treatment, by incrusting, by coating with one or more coats, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compound combination according to the invention by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the application form or the active compound combination according to the invention itself into the soil. 
 A preferred direct treatment of the plants is foliar application, i.e. the active compound combination according to the invention is applied to the foliage, where treatment frequency and the application rate should be adjusted according to the level of infestation with the pest in question. 
 In the case of systemically active compounds, the active compound combination according to the invention also access the plants via the root system. The plants are then treated by the action of the active compound combination according to the invention on the habitat of the plant. This may be done, for example, by drenching, or by mixing into the soil or the nutrient solution, i.e. the locus of the plant (e.g. soil or hydroponic systems) is impregnated with a liquid form of the active compound combination according to the invention, or by soil application, i.e. the active compound combination according to the invention is introduced in solid form (e.g. in the form of granules) into the locus of the plants, or by drip application (often also referred to as “chemigation”), i.e. the liquid application of the active compound combination according to the invention from surface or sub-surface driplines over a certain period of time together with varying amounts of water at defined locations in the vicinity of the plants. In the case of paddy rice crops, this can also be done by metering the active compound combination according to the invention in a solid application form (for example as granules) into a flooded paddy field. 
 Treatment of Seed 
 The control of animal pests by treating the seed of plants has been known for a long time and is the subject of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with, or at least reduce considerably, the additional application of pesticides during storage, after sowing or after emergence of the plants. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide optimum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by animal pests, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic insecticidal or nematicidal properties of pest-resistant or -tolerant transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and also the germinating plant with a minimum of pesticides being employed. 
 The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants, from attack by pests, by treating the seed with an active compound combination according to the invention. The method according to the invention for protecting seed and germinating plants against attack by pests furthermore comprises a method where the seed is treated simultaneously in one operation or sequentially with the compound of formula (I) and the mixing partner of group (II). 
 It also comprises a method where the seed is treated at different times with the compound of formula (I) and the mixing partner of group (II). 
 The invention likewise relates to the use of the active compound combination according to the invention for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the resulting plant from animal pests. 
 Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which has been treated with an active compound combination according to the invention so as to afford protection from animal pests. The invention also relates to seed which has been treated simultaneously with an active compound combination according to the invention. The invention furthermore relates to seed which has been treated at different times with the compound of formula (I) and the mixing partner of group (II). In the case of seed which has been treated at different points in time with an active compound combination according to the invention, the individual substances may be present on the seed in different layers. Here, the layers comprising a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing partner of group (II) may optionally be separated by an intermediate layer. The invention also relates to seed where a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing partner of group (II) have been applied as component of a coating or as a further layer or further layers in addition to a coating. 
 Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which, after the treatment with an active compound combination according to the invention, is subjected to a film-coating process to prevent dust abrasion on the seed. 
 One of the advantages encountered with a systemically acting active compound combination according to the invention is the fact that, by treating the seed, not only the seed itself but also the plants resulting therefrom are, after emergence, protected against animal pests. In this manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with. 
 It has to be considered a further advantage that by treatment of the seed with an active compound combination according to the invention, germination and emergence of the treated seed may be enhanced. 
 It is likewise to be considered advantageous that an active compound combination according to the invention can be used in particular also for transgenic seed. 
 Furthermore, active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed in combination with compositions or compounds of signalling technology, leading to better colonization by symbionts such as, for example, rhizobia, mycorrhizae and/or endophytic bacteria or fungi, and/or to optimized nitrogen fixation. 
 The active compound combinations according to the invention are suitable for protection of seed of any plant variety which is used in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in horticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of cereals (for example wheat, barley, rye, millet and oats), corn, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflowers, coffee, tobacco, canola, oilseed rape, beets (for example sugarbeets and fodder beets), peanuts, vegetables (for example tomatoes, cucumbers, bean, cruciferous vegetables, onions and lettuce), fruit plants, lawns and ornamental plants. The treatment of the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye and oats), maize, soya beans, cotton, canola, oilseed rape, vegetables and rice is of particular importance. 
 As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with an active compound combination according to the invention is also of particular importance. This takes the form of seed of plants which, as a rule, comprise at least one heterologous gene which governs the expression of a polypeptide with in particular insecticidal and/or nematicidal properties. The heterologous genes in transgenic seed can originate from microorganisms such as  Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus  or  Gliocladium.  The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed which comprises at least one heterologous gene originating from  Bacillus  sp. It is particularly preferably a heterologous gene derived from  Bacillus thuringiensis.    
 In the context of the present invention, the active compound combination according to the invention is applied to the seed. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. For example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content which allows storage. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, has been treated with, for example, water and then dried again, for example priming. In the case of rice seed, it is also possible to use seed which has been soaked, for example in water to a certain stage of the rice embryo ('pigeon breast stage'), stimulating the germination and a more uniform emergence. 
 When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the active compound combination according to the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be ensured particularly in the case of active compounds which can exhibit phytotoxic effects at certain application rates. 
 In general, the active compound combinations according to the invention are applied to the seed in a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and processes for seed treatment are known to the person skilled in the art. 
 The active compound combinations according to the invention can be converted to the customary seed dressing formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, slurries or other coating compositions for seed, and also ULV formulations. 
 These formulations are prepared in a known manner, by mixing the active compound combinations according to the invention with customary additives such as, for example, customary extenders and also solvents or diluents, colorants, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, preservatives, secondary thickeners, adhesives, gibberellins and also water. 
 Colorants which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations which can be used in accordance with the invention are all colorants which are customary for such purposes. It is possible to use either pigments, which are sparingly soluble in water, or dyes, which are soluble in water. Examples include the dyes known by the names Rhodamine B, C. I. Pigment Red 112 and C. I. Solvent Red 1. 
 Useful wetting agents which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which promote wetting and which are conventionally used for the formulation of agrochemically active compounds. Preference is given to using alkylnaphthalenesulphonates, such as diisopropyl- or diisobutylnaphthalenesulphonates. 
 Useful dispersants and/or emulsifiers which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all nonionic, anionic and cationic dispersants conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Preference is given to using nonionic or anionic dispersants or mixtures of nonionic or anionic dispersants. Suitable nonionic dispersants include in particular ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block polymers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers and tristryrylphenol polyglycol ethers, and the phosphated or sulphated derivatives thereof. Suitable anionic dispersants are in particular lignosulphonates, polyacrylic acid salts and arylsulphonate/formaldehyde condensates. 
 Antifoams which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all foam-inhibiting substances conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical ingredients. Preference is given to using silicone antifoams and magnesium stearate. 
 Preservatives which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Examples include dichlorophene and benzyl alcohol hemiformal. 
 Secondary thickeners which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which can be used for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Cellulose derivatives, acrylic acid derivatives, xanthan, modified clays and finely divided silica are preferred. 
 Adhesives which may be present in the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all customary binders usable in seed dressing products. Polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and tylose may be mentioned as being preferred. 
 Gibberellins which can be present in the seed-dressing formulations which can be used in accordance with the invention are preferably the gibberellins A1, A3 (=gibberellic acid), A4 and A7; gibberellic acid is especially preferably used. The gibberellins are known (cf. R. Wegler “Chemie der Pflanzenschutz- and Schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel”, vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1970, pp. 401-412). 
 The seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be used to treat a wide variety of different kinds of seed either directly or after prior dilution with water. For instance, the concentrates or the preparations obtainable therefrom by dilution with water can be used to dress the seed of cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, and triticale, and also the seed of maize, rice, oilseed rape, peas, beans, cotton, sunflowers, soya beans and beets, or else a wide variety of different vegetable seed. The seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or the dilute use forms thereof, can also be used to dress seed of transgenic plants. 
 For treatment of seed with the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or the use forms prepared therefrom by adding water, all mixing units usable customarily for the seed dressing are useful. Specifically, the procedure in the seed dressing is to place the seed into a mixer, operated batch-wise or continously, to add the particular desired amount of seed dressing formulations, either as such or after prior dilution with water, and to mix everything until the formulation is distributed homogeneously on the seed. If appropriate, this is followed by a drying operation. 
 The application rate of the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It is guided by the particular content of the active compound combinations according to the invention in the formulations and by the seed. The application rates of the active compound combinations according to the invention are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 15 g per kilogram of seed. 
 Vector Control 
 The active compound combinations according to the invention can also be used in vector control. For the purpose of the present invention, a vector is an arthropod, in particular an insect or arachnid, capable of transmitting pathogens such as, for example, viruses, worms, single-cell organisms and bacteria from a reservoir (plant, animal, human, etc.) to a host. The pathogens can be transmitted either mechanically (for example trachoma by non-stinging flies) to a host, or by injection (for example malaria parasites by mosquitoes) into a host. 
 Examples of vectors and the diseases or pathogens they transmit are: 
 1) Mosquitoes
         Anopheles: malaria, filariasis;   Culex: Japanese encephalitis, other viral diseases, filariasis, transmission of other worms;   Aedes: yellow fever, dengue fever, other viral diseases, filariasis;   Simuliidae: transmission of worms, in particular Onchocerca volvulus;   Psychodidae: transmission of leishmaniasis       
 2) Lice: skin infections, epidemic typhus; 
 3) Fleas: plague, endemic typhus, cestodes; 
 4) Flies: sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis); cholera, other bacterial diseases; 
 5) Mites: acariosis, epidemic typhus, rickettsialpox, tularaemia, Saint Louis encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, borreliosis; 
 6) Ticks: borellioses such as  Borrelia burgdorferi  sensu lato.,  Borrelia duttoni,  tick-borne encephalitis, Q fever ( Coxiella burnetii ), babesioses ( Babesia canis canis ), ehrlichiosis. 
 Examples of vectors in the sense of the present invention are insects, for example aphids, flies, leafhoppers or thrips, which are capable of transmitting plant viruses to plants. Other vectors capable of transmitting plant viruses are spider mites, lice, beetles and nematodes. 
 Further examples of vectors in the sense of the present invention are insects and arachnids such as mosquitoes, in particular of the genera  Aedes, Anopheles,  for example  A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, A. funestus, A. dirus  (malaria) and Culex, psychodids such as  Phlebotomus, Lutzomyia,  lice, fleas, flies, mites and ticks capable of transmitting pathogens to animals and/or humans. 
 Vector control is also possible if the active compound combinations according to the invention are resistance-breaking. 
 Active compound combinations according to the invention are suitable for use in the prevention of diseases and/or pathogens transmitted by vectors. Thus, a further aspect of the present invention is the use of active compound combinations according to the invention for vector control, for example in agriculture, in horticulture, in gardens and in leisure facilities, and also in the protection of materials and stored products. 
 Protection of Industrial Materials 
 The active compound combinations according to the invention are suitable for protecting industrial materials against attack or destruction by insects, for example from the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera and Zygentoma. 
 Industrial materials in the present context are understood to mean inanimate materials, such as preferably plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood, processed wood products and coating compositions. The use of the invention for protecting wood is particularly preferred. 
 In a further embodiment, the active compound combinations according to the invention are used together with at least one further insecticide and/or at least one fungicide. 
 In a further embodiment, the active compound combinations according to the invention are present as a ready-to-use pesticide, i.e. they can be applied to the material in question without further modifications. Suitable further insecticides or fungicides are in particular those mentioned above. 
 Surprisingly, it has also been found that the active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, in particular hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling. Likewise, the active compound combinations according to the invention, alone or in combinations with other active compounds, can be used as antifouling agents. 
 The plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously according to the invention with the active compound combinations according to the invention. The preferred ranges given above in the active compound combinations also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is placed on the plant treatment with the active compound combinations specifically mentioned in the present text. 
 The good effect of the active compound combinations according to the invention is evident from the following examples. While the individual active substances have weaknesses in effect, the combinations show an effect which goes beyond a simple effect-summation. A synergistic effect is always present when the action of the active compound combinations is greater than the sum of the effects of the individually applied active compounds. 
 EXAMPLES 
 Formula for the Efficacy of the Combination of Two Compounds 
 The expected efficacy of a given combination of two compounds is calculated as follows (see Colby, S. R., “Calculating Synergistic and antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations”, Weeds 15, pp. 20-22, 1967):
         If   X is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control for test compound A at a concentration of m ppm respectively m g/ha,   Y is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control for test compound B at a concentration of n ppm respectively n g/ha,       
 E is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control using the mixture of A and B at m and n ppm respectively m and n g/ha,
         then is       
 
 
 
 
 E 
 = 
 
 X 
 + 
 Y 
 - 
 
 
 X 
 × 
 Y 
 
 100 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 If the observed insecticidal efficacy of the combination is higher than the one calculated as “E”, then the combination of the two compounds is more than additive, i.e., there is a synergistic effect. 
 
 
 
 In all following examples, “ Bacillus firmus ” refers to  Bacillus firmus  strain CNCM I-1582 unless indicated otherwise. 
 Example A 
   Tetranychus urticae —Spray Test OP-Resistant 
 Solvent: 78.0 parts by weight acetone
         1.5 parts by weight dimethylformamide       
 Emulsifier: alkylarylpolyglycol ether 
 To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvents and is diluted with water, containing an emulsifier concentration of 1000 ppm, to the desired concentration. To produce a suitable preparation of a spore suspension the spores are diluted with emulsifier containing water to the desired concentration. Further test concentrations are prepared by dilution with emulsifier containing water. 
 French bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) leaf disks infected with all instars of the two spotted spidermite ( Tetranychus urticae ), are sprayed with a preparation of the active ingredient of the desired concentration. 
 After the specified period of time, mortality in % is determined. 100% means all spider mites have been killed and 0% means none of the spider mites have been killed. The mortality values determined thus are recalculated using the Colby-formula (see above). 
 According to the present application in this test e.g. the following combinations showed a synergistic effect in comparison to the single compounds:

 Example B 
   Tetranychus urticae —Spray Test; OP-Resistant 
 Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide 
 Emulsifier: alkylaryl polyglycol ether 
 To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and is diluted with water, containing an emulsifier concentration of 1000ppm, to the desired concentration. Further test concentrations are prepared by dilution with emulsifier containing water. 
 Bean plants ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) which are heavily infested with all stages of the two-spotted spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae ) are treated by being sprayed with the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration. 
 After the specified period of time mortality in % is determined. 100% means all the spider mites have been killed and 0% means none of the spider mites have been killed. The mortality values determined thus are recalculated using the Colby-formula (see above).

 Meloidogvne incognita—Test  
 
 Solvent: 125.0 parts by weight of acetone 
 To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. 
 To produce a suitable preparation of a spore suspension the spores are diluted with water to the desired concentration. 
 Vessels are filled with sand, a solution of the active ingredient, a suspension containing eggs and larvae of the southern root-knot nematode ( Meloidogyne incognita ) and salad seeds. The salad seeds germinate and the seedlings grow. Galls develop in the roots. 
 After the specified period of time nematicidal activity is determined on the basis of the percentage of gall formation. 100% means no galls were found and 0% means the number of galls found on the roots of the treated plants was equal to that in untreated control plants. 
 According to the present application in this test e.g. the following combinations showed a synergistic effect in comparison to the single compounds:

 Example D 
 Meloidogyne incognita—Test 
 Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide 
 Emulsifier: 2.5 parts by weight of alkylarylpolyglycolether 
 To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and emulsifier and is diluted with water to the desired concentration. To produce a suitable preparation of a spore suspension the spores are diluted with emulsifier containing water to the desired concentration. In the calculation of the concentration the soil volume has to be included. Care has to be taken that the emulsifier concentration in the soil does not exceed 20 ppm. Further test concentrations are prepared by dilution with water. 
 The compound solution is poured into pots filled with soil (loamy sand). A suspension containing eggs and larvae of the southern root-knot nematode ( Meloidogyne incognita ) is added, salad seeds are spread on the soil surface and covered with quartz sand. The salad seeds germinate and the seedlings grow. Galls develop on the roots. 
 After the specified period of time the nematicidal activity is determined on the basis of the percentage of gall formation. 100% means no galls were found; 0% means the number of galls found on the roots of the treated plants was equal to that in untreated control plants. The activity determined thus is recalculated using the Colby-formula (see above).
