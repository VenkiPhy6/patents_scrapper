      This application is a continuation-in-part of our prior co-pending application Ser. No. 11/129,317, filed May 16, 2005. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0002]
      I. Field of the Invention  
     
    
    [0003]
      This invention relates to inoculants used to promote plant growth and yield. More particularly, the invention relates to inoculants of this kind containing strains of Rhizobia used with legumes, e.g. peas and lentils, for improving nitrogen fixation, nodulation, etc.  
     
    
    [0004]
      II. Description of the Prior Art  
     
    
    [0005]
      Biological nitrogen fixation is the consequence of a complex and unique symbiosis between  Rhizobium  bacteria and legume host plants. The first stage in this process is the formation of nodules which occurs by the penetration of the host root hairs by rhizobial bacteria, followed by the formation of a rhizobial infection thread which moves into the host plant's root cortex, after which the rhizobial bacteria are encased in specialized plant cells and then undergo rapid multiplication. Subsequently, the rhizobial bacteria become pleomorphic, their nuclear material degenerates and the resulting bacteroids develop the enzyme complexes, particularly nitrogenase, required for nitrogen fixation (Paul, E. A. and F. E. Clark, 1989, Soil Microbiology and Biochemistry. Academic Press Inc. San Diego. pp. 182-192). The environmental, nutritional and physiological conditions required for rhizobial cell growth and the successful establishment of efficient nitrogen-fixing symbioses are known (Trinick, M. J., 1982, IN W. J. Broughton (Ed.), Nitrogen Fixation Vol. 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford. pp. 76-146)  
     
    
    [0006]
      The amounts of nitrogen fixed by legume: Rhizobium  symbioses are significant and, in agricultural situations, can be used to supplement or replace nitrogen fertilizer applications. For example, a typical rate of nitrogen fixation by nodulated alfalfa is up to 250 kg/hectare/year (Atlas, R. M. and R. Baitha, 1981, Microbial Ecology: Fundamentals and Applications, Addison-Wesley Pub. Co. Reading. pp. 364-365) and up to 450 kg/ha/yr by nodulated soybeans (Peoples, M. B. and E. T. Craswell, 1992, Plant Soil 141: 13-39). Consequently, legume crops have become an integral component of most field crop rotations used in agriculture around the world.  
     
    
    [0007]
      Commercial rhizobial inoculant compositions are commonly used when planting legume crops to ensure that sufficient rhizobial bacteria are present to establish effective nitrogen-fixing systems. Various types of commercial  Rhizobium  inoculant carriers, compositions and preparations are known including liquids, powders and granules (Thompson, J. A., 1991, IN Report of the Expert Consultation on Legume Inoculant Production and Quality Control (J. A. Thompson, Ed.) Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations, Rome, pp. 15-32).  
     
    
    [0008]
      Even though such rhizobial inoculant compositions are already known, there is always a desire to find and utilize improved versions that are more effective or advantageous, at least for specific crops and growth environments.  
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0009]
      An object of the present invention is to enable legume crops to fix nitrogen at high rates in order to generate good crop growth and/or yields.  
     
    
    [0010]
      The present invention provides a novel strain of the bacterium  Rhizobium leguminosarum  (designated strain SO12A-2) in isolated and/or purified form that can be used to inoculate legume plants to improve growth and yield by nitrogen fixation.  
     
    
    [0011]
      The invention also relates to inoculant compositions containing the novel strain, to seeds coated with the inoculant compositions, and to methods of improving plant growth and yield employing the novel strain.  
     
    
    [0012]
      An advantage of the invention, at least in preferred forms, is that it can improve the property of  Rhizobium leguminosarum for assisting legumes in the fixing of nitrogen for use by the plants, e.g. by increasing nodulation, thereby improving nitrogen fixation, plant growth and productivity in legumes.

The plant growth and yield values are the averages of a statistically significant numbers of plants taken from each plant crop and compared directly.  
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0021]
      As noted above, the present invention relates primarily to a novel strain of the  Rhizobium leguminosarum  bacterium (a strain designated by the applicants herein as strain SO12A-2 and deposited at an international patent depository as indicated above) and its use to improve growth and productivity of legume crops, particularly pea and lentil, by enhancement of nitrogen fixation by the growing plants.  
     
    
    [0022]
      The new strain SO12A-2 is one of several isolated from the natural environment as described in the Experimental Details section below and found to be superior for enhancing legume plant growth and yield.  
     
    
    [0023]
      The novel strain was obtained from the location shown in Table 1 below:  
           TABLE 1                         Collection Site Information               Location:                       Sample   (Nearest Town   Latitude   Date   Description of   Plant       ID#   or City)   Longitude   Collected   Surroundings   Association               S012A-2   Battleford, SK   52° 48′ 47N   Aug. 9,   Aspen bluff,     Lathyrus                 108° 29′ 29W   2001   located in     venosus                         sandhills,                       mixed grasses.                       Aspen have                       white trunks                 
 
     
    
    [0024]
      Each strain of  Rhizobium leguminosarum  is different from the others. In fact, some strains can provide no benefit whatsoever if used as an inoculant and some strains can even be parasitic to a crop and reduce growth. Strain S012A-2 is widely applicable for commercial production as it is effective on both pea and lentil and can be produced in a peat liquid or granular formulation.  
     
    
    [0025]
      The novel strain can be propagated from a small sample by conventional methods of bacterial growth and multiplication. In the present invention, isolated and pure samples of the strain SO12A-2 multiplied in this way are normally used to prepare an inoculant composition by infecting a preferably sterile inoculant carrier with the bacterial strain. The inoculant composition is then used to inoculate a legume crop, preferably by planting seeds of the crop in contact with the inoculant composition, ideally by coating the seeds with the inoculant composition (peat or a liquid, for example) prior to planting. Alternatively, a granular or liquid product that contains the specific strain can be added directly to the soil (e.g. in soil furrows). The seed are then planted in the furrow with the soil applied inoculant.  
     
    
    [0026]
      When legume seeds are contacted with an inoculant composition, successful inoculation of the seeds with the bacterial strain, and the resulting benefits to the legume: Rhizobium  symbiosis, are not limited to a particular inoculant carrier type, a particular inoculation process, or a particular legume: Rhizobium  symbiosis, but rather, can be accomplished in a variety of ways. The carrier employed may be liquid or solid (e.g. a powder or granules—i.e. aggregates consisting of particles bound together), but the preferred inoculant carrier is an organic solid, for example peat. Seeds may be coated with an aqueous slurry of sterilized peat infected with the bacterial strain and then allowed to dry. Alternatively, the seeds may be directly dry-coated with infected powdered peat having a moisture content of, for example, 6 to 20% by weight. Most preferably in such cases, the powdered peat (or other solid inoculant carrier) contains a sticking agent that facilitates the adhesion of the inoculant composition to the legume seeds. Examples of suitable sticking agents include alginate, graphite, gum arabic and methyl cellulose used in quantities sufficient to ensure the required adhesion to the seeds.  
     
    
    [0027]
      In the case of liquid formulations, there are many potential ingredients for producing such formulations. Possible liquid formulants include: water, glycerol, polymers (polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, for example), glucose, yeast extract, NaOH and buffers (KH 2 PO 4 , for example).  
     
    
    [0028]
      An example of a method of forming a liquid inoculant composition is to obtain an aliquot of novel  Rhizobium  cells from a stock culture. This aliquot is inoculated aseptically into a culture medium containing a carbon source, yeast autolysate and buffering components. The culture is then incubated for 4-8 days at 30° C. with shaking. Subsequently, formulation components are added to the culture medium. The formulated liquid culture is then transferred aseptically into previously gamma-irradiated 5 L polyethylene bags and stored at room temperature. The final titre of the bags is in the range of 1×10 6  to 1×10 11  cells per mL.  
     
    
    [0029]
      An example of a method of forming a granular inoculant composition is to obtain an adequate granule source (peat, clay or gypsum for example). This granule is then mixed with a volume of novel  Rhizobium  culture which was grown for 4-8 days at 30° C. in a medium containing a carbon source, yeast autolysate and buffering components. The culture is added to the carrier at such a rate as to yield a final moisture content of 30% wet weight. Other formulants are also added at this time. The formulation is mixed to a uniform consistency, transferred to 20 Kg polyethylene lined paper bags and left to cure at 25° C. for 1 to 3 weeks. The final titer of the bags is in the range of 1×10 6  to 1×10 11  cfu/gram.  
     
    
    [0030]
      An example of a way of forming a inoculant composition containing peat is to package peat (having a moisture content of preferably 6 to 20% by weight) in plastic bags of an appropriate size for sale and use, with or without a sticking agent, and then to sterilize the bags in a manner that ensures complete absence of contaminating microorganisms. Using aseptic techniques, an aqueous suspension of the novel  Rhizobium  cells is then added to each bag in a concentration appropriate to produce the preferred number of cfu/gram in the final inoculant product. The total volume of suspension added to each bag is preferably such that the final moisture content of the composition does not exceed 50% by weight. In fact, a more preferred final content is in the range of 40 to 45% by weight. After the microbial suspension has been mixed well with the peat (e.g. by massaging or tumbling the bags), the bags are cured at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30° C. for a period of 7 to 35 days prior to storage at ambient temperature. If a sticking agent is incorporated into the peat prior to sterilization, the composition can be directly applied to legume seeds or, alternatively, the seeds can be dampened prior to coating. If a sticking agent is not incorporated into the peat, the composition may be made into a slurry by adding the composition plus a sticking agent to a volume of water an mixing well before coating seeds. Examples of sticking agents used in this way include honey, skim milk and wallpaper paste, in addition to the sticking agents already mentioned above. Legume seeds coated in this way may be handled and planted in the same way as seeds coated with other materials.  
     
    
    [0031]
      Alternatively, a liquid rhizobial inoculant can be applied directly to legume seeds or applied in-furrow and a granular rhizobial inoculant can be applied in-furrow with the legume seed.  
     
    
    [0032]
      It is preferred that legumes with large-sized seeds, e.g. peas and lentils, receive a range of 1×10 3  to 1×10 7  colony forming units per seed (cfu/seed) of  Rhizobium leguminosarum  strain S012A-2.  
     
    
    [0033]
      Examples of preferred legume seeds that can be inoculated with  Rhizobium leguminosarum  strain S012A-2 include peas (Psium spp.) and lentils ( Lens culinaris ).  
     
    
    [0034]
      If desired, the novel strain of  Rhizobium leguminosarum  of the present invention may be used in combination with  Penicillium bilaii  (also used is  Penicillium bilaiae ), a phosphate-solubilizing soil fungus as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,417 which issued to Reginald Kucey on Jun. 25, 1991 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). The fungus  Penicillium bilaii  is a known micro-organism. A fungus identified as  Penicillium bilaji  was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection in Rockville, Md., USA (now moved to Manassas, Va., 20108, USA) under the deposit number ATCC 22348 (1974 edition of the ATCC catalogue). In the 1984 catalogue, the same deposit number was used for  P. bilaii  and a further strain was identified by the deposit number 18309. It is not known whether the change of name occurred as a result of a clerical error or whether the fungus has been re-named. In any event, the name  P.bilaii  is used for the micro-organism throughout this specification. An inoculant containing  P. bilaii  can be obtained commercially under the trademark JumpStart from Philom Bios Inc., of 3935 Thatcher Avenue, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Preferred ways of combining  P. bilaii  with Rhizobia are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,464, which issued to Gleddie et al. on Jan. 16, 1996 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference).  
     
    
    [0035]
      The nodulation and nitrogen fixation processes in legume: Rhizobium  symbioses require substantial energy expenditures by the plant host and, therefore, considerable soluble phosphate is required to ensure that these processes proceed at optimal rates. Since  P. bilaii  has the properties of solubilizing insoluble phosphate from native and applied solid forms, e.g. precipitated calcium phosphate, rock phosphate, and various types of phosphate fertilizers, the essence of the combination of  P. bilaii  with the novel rhizobial strain of the present invention relates to increased availability of soluble phosphate and fixed nitrogen to the legume: Rhizobium  symbioses as a consequence of the  P. bilaii  activity, such that the rhizobial strain is better able to provide benefits to legume nitrogen fixation, plant growth and productivity.  
     
    
    [0036]
      These inoculant compositions containing  P. bilaii  and the novel rhizobial strain of the present invention can be formed and used without difficulty in much the same way as the inoculant compositions of the rhizobial strain itself. Combination  Penicillium bilaii  and rhizobial inoculant compositions are available commercially under the trademark TagTeam from Philom Bios Inc., of 318-111 Research Drive, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  
     
    
    [0037]
      As an example, using aseptic techniques, a suspension of  P. bilaii  spores and  Rhizobium  cells may be transferred into sterilized bags of peat such that the final concentration of spores after the composition step is completed is in the range of 1×10 4  to 1×10 9 cfu/g, and the titre of  Rhizobium  cells after the composition step is completed is in the range of 1×10 5  to 1×10 11  cfu/g. If a sticking agent is incorporated into a peat carrier prior to sterilization, the resulting composition can be directly applied to the appropriate legume seeds or, alternatively, the seeds can be dampened prior to the inoculation step. Legume seeds inoculated with  Penicillium bilaii  and rhizobial inoculant compositions are handled and planted in the same manner as legume seeds inoculated only with rhizobial inoculants.  
     
    
    [0038]
      In the operation of the present invention, after being contacted with the novel strain of  Rhizobium leguminosarum  (either with or without  P. bilaii ), the legume plants may be germinated and grown in a manner entirely identical to the germination and growth of untreated legume crops, e.g. by planting seeds and subjecting the seeds to conditions of moisture, sunlight and temperature that promote plant growth and development to maturity. Conventional fertilizers, pesticides, soil amendments, and the like, may be used in the conventional manner, if required or desirable. Conventional harvesting practices may be employed. Such operations are clearly well known to farmers and agriculturalists and require no further discussion or explanation.  
     
    
    [0039]
      The isolation and testing of the novel strain of  Rhizobium leguminosarum  according to the present invention is illustrated in the following Experimental Details.

            1 Pea seed Cultivar (‘Mozart’)     12 Seed Treatments (Uninoculated, Nitrogen, Eight untested strains, PBI #108, PBI #101)     Randomized Block. 
 
 Strain Selection Criteria: 
       
   
    
    [0045]
      Eight strains varied on their size, color, and morphology. Strains were selected based on their uniqueness of these three traits and their geographic location.  
      Material & Methods;  
     
     
 
 
  1) Collected field soil was sifted through a ¼ inch screen to remove any lumps of soil, roots, other plant material, sticks, etc. The soil was then spread out to dry for a period of one week and then placed into plastic bins until needed.  
  2) Pots (4-½ inch×5 inch deep) were then labeled according to treatment. A sterile square pieces of spun polyester (black landscape fabric) was then placed into the bottom of each of the pots to prevent the sand/soil mixture from draining out through the pots drainage holes.  
  3) A 50% mixture of Kyle soil/silica sand or 50% Aberdeen soil/silica sand (Unimum Industries—industrial quartz) was used as a potting media.  
  4) After filling each pot with the sand/soil mixture each pot was placed into a large plastic Ziploc™ bag.  
  5) One day before seeding each pot was watered with 150 ml of tap water (non-sterile) and the bags were sealed until seeded.  
  6) On the day of seeding 5.5 kg of pea seed—cultivar ‘Mozart’—was divided up into eleven 500 gram amounts and surfaced sterilized via the following method: 
            a) Place 500 grams of seed into a 2 liter glass Erlenmeyer flask     b) Cover the seeds with 95% Ethanol, let stand 60 seconds then drain.     c) Add a fresh preparation of a 50% bleach solution (1000 mls into 1000 mls water-2.6% NaOCl active), add seed, shake and let  stand  5 minutes, then drain.     d) Rinse with 4 changes of R.O. water (non-sterile) followed by one rinse with sterile R.O. water.    
 
  7) After surface sterilization each 500 g amount of seed was spread into an aluminum foil pan lined with sterile paper towel and blotted dry and then transferred into clean large Ziploc™ bags.  
  8) After inoculation uninoculated and inoculated pea seeds were planted. Five pea seeds were placed into each  pot  2 inches below the surface. Spoons and forceps used to plant the seed were washed and dried thoroughly between treatments.  
 
 
 
   
    
    [0058]
      9) The bags were then sealed and placed into a growth chamber that was set for the following conditions:  
                                         a. Day length   16 Hrs at 21.5° C.           b.  Night length     8 Hrs at 16° C.           c. R.H.   Not controlled           d. Lighting Source-   Metal Halide,               High Pressure Sodium           e. Intensity-   Not measured.                     
            10) Each pot was placed into a plastic bin in a randomized block design (two bins contained one pot of each of the 24 treatments). A total of 20 bins were used to hold all of the treatments. Three times a week (Monday's, Wednesdays and Fridays) each plastic bin was moved one bin position to the right. This was done to ensure differences in light intensity/quality or temperature were consistent for each of the treatments inside the growth chamber.     11) Bags were kept fully closed until 50% emergence was observed, then fully opened.     12) Plants were checked daily and watered as required using tap water.     13) After 35 days plants were photographed (digital image file) and then harvested.

 Experiment 3: Comparisons with Other Strains 
 
     
    
    [0088]
      Plasmid profiles as shown in  FIG. 1  of different isolates of  R. leguminosarum  isolated from Saskatchewan fields (Canada) were determined by a modified Eckhardt technique and visualized on agarose gel (Eckhardt, T. 1978,  Plasmid  1, 584-588; described by Hynes et al., 1985,    Plasmid   13, 99-105; and as modified by Hynes & McGregor, 1990,  Mol. Microbiol.,  4, 567-574; the disclosures of which documents are specifically incorporated herein by reference). This technique identified 27 major plasmid profiles, with 18 of these containing 1 or more sub-profiles resulting in 61 different plasmid profiles. Known inoculant strain, P108, is identified as  column  13b and the S012A-2 strain is identified as column 19 (see arrows in  FIG. 1 ). The band pattern depicted in  FIG. 1  shows the number and size of the plasmids in each strain. The results show that there was a great deal of variation in the number and size of the plasmids. Strains P108 and S012A-2 both contain 4 plasmids but they differ in size (see  FIG. 1 ).  
     
    
    [0089]
      A protein profile comparison, as shown in  FIG. 2 , also shows distinct differences between strains P108 and S012A-2.  
     
    
    [0090]
      Another method to distinguish between strains is to test for antibiotic resistance. Table 3 below shows the rating system used to determine antibiotic resistance. Three strains; P108 (current commercial strain), P101 (previous commercial strain) and S012A-2 were tested for antibiotic resistance to 11 antibiotics (Table 4). The diameter of the inhibition zone is measured after 48 hours. The inhibition zone is then converted to a rating of degree of resistance of the isolate to the antibiotic (Table 3). The results in Table 4 indicate that all three tested strains (P108, P101 and S012A-2) have different antibiotic resistance patterns.

      Another method was employed to distinguish between different strains of rhizobia by comparing the carbohydrate usage of the strains. Use of Biolog™ plates revealed differences between the strains (P108, P101 and S012A-2) with very different carbohydrate utilization patterns. Results showed that isolate S012A-2 can use a broader range of carbohydrates (P<0.05 based on Chi Square analysis), compared to either P108 or P101, as well as having different utilization profiles (see  FIG. 3 ).  
     
    
    [0093]
      Strains of rhizobia are commercially much more useful if they can be formulated as liquid inoculants. A test comparing strain SO12A-2 with strain P108 showed that the former is suitable for liquid formulation whereas the latter is not. The strains were grown to 54 hours and stored in flasks at room temperature. Strain P108 did not survive when formulated as a liquid while S012A-2 showed good survival (see  FIG. 4 —the asterisk indicates the point at which the assay of P108 was terminated as the titres had dropped below commercially acceptable levels (1×10 8  cfu/g)).  
     
    
    [0094]
      An experiment was carried out to determine if strain S012A-2 is more effective in promoting plant growth and nitrogen assimilation than strain P108. The experiment was carried out with two different soil types. The soils were mixed with sand (1:1 v/v) to ensure that the soil was nitrogen deficient. Mozart pea seeds were inoculated with peat inoculum before seeding at a rate of 5-7×10 5  cfu/seed. Five seeds were planted in each pot and thinned to 3 plants/pot at emergence. The plants were harvested 35 days after planting. Visual observations of plant color root growth and nodule development were made at harvest. The shoots were dried and weighed and analyzed for nitrogen content. The nitrogen response was greater in the Soil#1 with larger differences noted between the inoculated and uninoculated treatments. Plants inoculated with S012A-2 had greater nitrogen assimilation than P108 (as shown in Table 5 below).

    [0095]
      In a second set of growth room experiments, seven isolates that had shown promise in previous trials were compared to strain P108. The plants were tested in sand and there were 10 replicates/treatments. Nitrogen added at the optimum level for peas and lentils in this soil was used as a positive control. A rating system which takes into account both colour and dry weight showed that strain S012A-2 out performed strain P108 in both pea and lentil. The inoculant treatments were ranked according to a visual estimate of color and this was combined with a ranking based on the statistical analysis of the dry weights to arrive at an overall ranking. The individual replicates were not treated separately for the color ranking so overall ranking data could not be statistically analyzed. Generally plants inoculated with strain S012A-2 were greener and or had a higher dry weight than plants inoculated with strain P108 (see  FIG. 5 ). Significant (P<0.05) dry weight differences between strains P108 and S012A-2 were also noted for pea. Additionally, both strains were superior to the uninoculated control when comparing shoot dry weights (Table 6). Additionally, both pea and lentil plants inoculated with strain S012A-2 were greener than those inoculated with strain P108 or the uninoculated control.
