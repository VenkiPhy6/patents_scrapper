 PATHOGENS IN PLANTS TECHNICAL FIELD 
 The present invention relates to a new strain of Gliocladium roseum fungus, referred to as ACM941 that is capable of controlling plant diseases. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of the new strain of Gliocladium roseum fungus as a biological control agent (sometimes referred to as bioagent) to inhibit soil-borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens and to enhance plant growth and productivity in both greenhouse and field conditions. BACKGROUND ART 
 Soil-borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens of plants are responsible for severe economic losses in the agricultural and horticultural industries worldwide. These pathogens cause plant diseases such as seed decay, root/foot rot, seedling blight and wilt. Such diseases commonly reduce emergence, plant vigor and yield potential. Severe disease infection can kill emerging seedlings of an entire plant population, and result in a total loss of crop yield. 
 Solutions to the recurring problem of plant pathogens have been explored for decades. As particular crops become more abundant, and the area of land allocated for agriculture expands, there is an inherent need to employ more efficient and effective farming practices. As a result of increasing demand for crop production, farmers must often compromise their cultural practices by planting crops on sub-optimal land, or by increasing the frequency at which crops are planted in a specific location. In doing so, crop nutrients are depleted and specific crop pathogens, especially soil-borne or seed-borne pathogens, become more prevalent. Accordingly, it is increasingly difficult to sustain the health and productivity of a respective crop. 
 Historically, preferred cultural practices and chemical controls were used in combination to combat destructive pathogens. More recently, the use of integrated systems employing biocontrol agents and chemicals has become more prevalent 1  (note: all superscript reference numerals relate to a list of references appearing at the end of this disclosure). However, despite progressive research in recent years, chemical alternatives remain the most reliable and economic solution to the problems caused by most soil-borne and seed-borne plant pathogens. 
 The case of field pea is illustrative. There were approximately 900,000 hectares of field pea in western Canada in 1998, estimated at a total fann value of over $400,000 million. In recent years, the field pea crops of western Canada have been most affected by soil-borne or 

seed-borne diseases, as well as the Ascochyta complexes of root and foliage. Known as PRRC (pea root rot complex) diseases, the soil-borne and seed-borne diseases are most commonly caused by the pathogens Fusarium solani f.sp. pisi, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. pisi, Mycosphaerella pinodes, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotina sclerotiorum, Aphanomyces euteiches, Alternaria alternata and Pythium spp. The incidence of PRRC diseases varies with year and location, while its severity is largely dependent on climate, crop rotation and cultural practices. The yield losses of pea crops alone, as a result of PRRC pathogens including foliar infection by Ascochyta complex, are frequently devastating with a conservative 15% yield reduction translating into an approximate annual loss of $60 million in areas of western Canada. As crops such as pea become increasingly important, efforts must focus on more effective and efficient means of crop farming, both in Canada and around the world. 
 The most effective solution to the destruction of crop plants by pathogens would most likely be the development of resistant cultivars, which would allow for plant growth and productivity in the presence of fungal pathogens. Unfortunately, success in the development of PRRC resistant cultivars of pea, or other resistant crop cultivars, has not been forthcoming. 
 Alternatively, biological control of crop plant pathogens by microorganisms may be considered a more natural and environmentally friendly alternative to existing chemical treatment methods. Accordingly, it is desirable to isolate a microorganism, which displays antagonistic effects against a target pathogen, and is capable of survival and propagation in a target location. Efforts to isolate antagonistic microorganisms effective against plant pathogens have been underway in recent years. As a result, several microbial isolates have proven effective as plant pathogen antagonists and some related biocontrol products are currently commercially available, including: Mycostop™ (Streptomyces sp.); GleoGard™ (Trichoderma virens); Kodiak™ (Bacillus sp.); and BioTrek™ (Trichoderma sp.); TRICHODEX™ (Trichoderma harzianum); and BINAB-T™ (T. harzianum plus T. polysporum). 
 The effectiveness of bioagents against certain pathogens has been characterized according to a variety of modes of action. Cook et al. 2  described the modes by which a bioagent can effectively act against target pathogens as including: (i) a parasitic attack against the pathogen, (ii) a competitor for a common food source, (iii) a source of toxic antibiotic substances, or (iv) an induced indirect toxic effect by the release of volatile substances. As such, a bioagent behaves as a natural antagonist to the pathogen. 
 Although efforts have concentrated on the biological control of PRRC pathogens, obstacles in stability, delivery and versatility have not been resolved. Specifically, 

Hwang et al. 3  in 1992 reported the potential use of Gliocladium virens (Syn. Trichoderma virens) as a biocontrol agent against Rhizoctonia caused root rot in field pea, when employed with a fungicide. In this integrated control system, the presence ofthe fungicide provided protection against the pathogen when the environmental conditions inhibited the activity ofthe bioagent. Parke et al. 4  in 1991 disclosed findings ofthe effectiveness of Pseudomonas cepacia and P. fluorescens against Pythium damping-off and Aphanomyces root rot in pea when applied to seed. P. cepacia was disclosed as being the most effective bacterium, increasing emergence by an average of 40% and yield by 48% over captan fungicide alone. The Parke et al. reference further reported on disclosures ofthe effectiveness of seed treatment with species of Trichoderma 5  and Penicilium oxalicum 6  against diseases of pea. Oyarzun et al. 7  further reported findings, in 1993, ofthe biological control of root rot in pea caused by Fusarium solani, with two nonpathogenic Fusarium oxysporum isolates. Both isolates of F. oxysporum investigated, displayed reduced disease severity and prevented the plant weight losses owing to F. solani f. sp. pisi in sterilized soil. In 1996, Xi et al. 8  reported on the effectiveness of formulated Rhizobacteria against root rot of field pea. Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain PRA25) peat- based granular formulation increased yield by 17% over untreated, in a trial with light disease infection, and by 120% in another trial with moderate infection. P. cepacia (strain AMMD) and P. fluorescens increased seedling emergence, and decreased disease incidence and severity. However, these agents had variable effect on yield when disease level was light to moderate. In addition, biocontrol agents resulted in only limited control when disease was severe. As a result, a commercially available microbial product for the treatment of root rot diseases of pea is not currently available. 8   
 U.S. Patent No. 5,165,928, issued on November 24, 1992 to Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. and entitled "Biological Control of Phytophtora by Gliocladium ', discloses the use of strains of Gliocladium virens (Syn. Trichoderma virens) on the root biosphere of plants in controlling plant diseases caused by Phytophthora sofae. More specifically, this patent is directed to the use of specific strains of T virens on P. sojae-c&used stem and root rot in soybean plants. 
 Steinmetz and Schobeck 9  (1993), reported the use of conifer bark inoculum, comprising Trichoderma harzianum or Gliocladium roseum, in controlling Pythium ultimum on pea. 
 Specifically, the applicability of conifer bark as a growth medium and inoculum carrier for T. harzianum or G. roseum was examined, as well as the antagonistic efficacy of such preparations to protect pea seedlings against pre-emergence damping-off caused by P. ultimum. This 

investigation looked at the possibility of using bark inoculum to control soil-borne pathogens in horticultural practice, and not specifically at the effectiveness ofthe respective fungal antagonist isolates. However, it was reported that a pretreatment with a nutrient solution was required on the G. rαse«/rø-containing bark inoculum for optimum development and efficiency ofthe antagonist. Accordingly, the G. roseum isolate investigated by Steinmetz and Schobeck is not easily or economically propagated for the treatment of seedlings. 
 Accordingly, the prior art has not disclosed a biocontrol agent effective against a variety of root rot pathogens, nor is there a bioagent, which can be economically and readily propagated for easy application to seeds or soil. Furthermore, a commercially effective biocontrol agent does not exist which can be applied to a seed or a suitable host, and provide prolonged effectiveness against a range of plant pathogens. In addition, there has not been previously disclosed a biocontrol agent, which, in the absence of an accompanying fungicide, is effective against a range of root rot pathogens including PRRC pathogens Pythium spp., Fusarium solani f.sp. pisi, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. pisi, Mycosphaerella pinodes, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotina sclerotiorum, Alternaria alternata, and Aphanomyces euteiches; common root rot pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana; and fusarium head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum. 
 The lack of commercial development in the area of biocontrol products, and more specifically with respect to such products effective against root rot pathogens, may be largely in part due to the need for excessive amounts ofthe biocontrol agent, or, in the case of seed treatments, the short term effectiveness of the product. 10  In addition, the commercial availability of biocontrol agents against plant pathogens has been hampered by the lack of effective delivery systems." The most successful biologically-based practices reported to date involve integrated management systems which employ a combination of biological, chemical and cultural control measures." Accordingly, it is desirable to produce biocontrol agents which are effective against plant pathogens, under a variety of conditions and for a prolonged period of time. In addition, it is desirable to eliminate the need for chemical treatment in controlling root rot diseases in crop plants. More specifically, with respect to the present invention, it is desirable to produce an economically efficient biocontrol agent which can be readily propagated and applied to a plant source or growth medium to provide prolonged effectiveness against a range of PRRC pathogens. In addition, it is desirable to provide a biocontrol agent effective against a range of soil-borne and seed-borne pathogens in a variety of crop species. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION 
 A main objective ofthe present invention is to provide a biological control agent 

effective against a variety of plant pathogens, and more specifically, to provide a biological control agent effective against PRRC pathogens of pea, as well as other root pathogens of other plant species. 
 It is a further objective to provide an effective and commercially viable method of propagating the biological control agent ofthe present invention. 
 Further still, it is an objective ofthe present invention to provide a biological control agent which is at least as effective against plant pathogens as existing chemical alternatives, under appropriate conditions, and to provide an effective delivery system for said biological control agent. It is a further objective ofthe present invention to provide an effective and commercially viable method of propagating the biocontrol agent of the present invention. 
 Another objective is to provide a delivery system for the effective application ofthe biocontrol agent ofthe present invention to a plant source or growth medium. 
 The present invention is based on the discovery and isolation of a novel strain of Gliocladium roseum Bainier, shown to have antagonistic effects against several plant pathogens, particularly root rot fungal pathogens in groups of Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Oomycetes and Zygomycetes; as well as in a variety of host species in Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. For example, when applied to seeds of pea, the isolates ofthe present invention exhibit antagonistic capabilities against fungal pathogens that, in both controlled environments and field conditions, can be at least as effective as current chemical fungicides. 
 Thus, according to one aspect ofthe invention, there is provided a biologically pure culture of a strain of a microorganism G. roseum exhibiting antagonistic effects against a plant pathogen. Preferably, the strain ofthe microorganism is a strain ACM941 having the identifying characteristics of ATCC #74447 (please refer to the deposit information provided later). 
 According to another aspect ofthe invention, there is provided a composition comprising: a culture of a strain of G. roseum (preferably ACM941 ) exhibiting antagonistic effects against a plant pathogen; and a delivery medium, e.g. a plant seed. The invention also relates to seeds coated with a strain ofthe microorganism (preferably 
 ACM941) and to methods of treating plants and plant seeds, etc., with the strain and compositions containing the strain. 

 According to a still further aspect ofthe invention, there is provided a method of propagating the strain of G. roseum (preferably ACM941) exhibiting antagonistic effects against fungal plant pathogens, which comprises incubating spores of said strain in a liquid medium for 3 to 5 days at a temperature in the range of 25°C to 30°C under low light intensity and pH_> 4.5. As described below, the strain of the present invention has been shown to display antagonistic effects against 13 pathogens including Bipolaris sorokiniana, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Mycosphaerella pinodes and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum representing the group of Ascomycetes; Ascochyta spp, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata representing Deuteromycetes; Pythium aphanidermatum, Pythium ultimum and Aphanomyces euteiches representing Oomycetes; and Rhizopus sp. representing 
 Zygomycetes. These 13 pathogens cause seed decay, root/foot rot, seedling blight and wilt on 17 crop plants including canola, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower (Brassicaceae), field bean, field pea and sweet pea (Fabaceae), sugar beet and table beet (Chenopodiaceae), cucumber (Cucurbitaceae), marigold (Asteraceae), egg plant, pepper and tomato (Solanaceae), and wheat and barley (Poaceae). These are collectively referred to as pathosystems. In particular, these pathosystems are Rhizoctonia solani on pea (field pea and sweet pea), bean (dry bean and garden bean), beet (sugar beet and table beet), broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, canola, cauliflower, cucumber, egg plant, pepper, tomato and marigold; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, Pythium ultimum, Aphanomyces euteiches, Ascochyta spp., Rhizopus sp. and Mycosphaerella pinodes on pea; Bipolaris sorokiniana and Fusarium graminearum on wheat and barley. From these results, it is apparent that the strain of G. roseum has a broad effect on most or all fungal pathogens. The host plants appear to have little effect on the efficacy of ACM941 seed treatments in controlling fungal diseases, as shown by the effectiveness of the biocontrol agent against Rhizoctonia foot/root rot caused by R. solani in pea, bean, beet, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, canola, cauliflower, cucumber, egg plant, pepper, tomato and marigold. It is therefore predictable that the strain of G. roseum (ACM941) will control the same disease caused by the same pathogen in various field and horticultural crops, vegetables, and ornamental plants. Besides the tested crops, Rhizoctonia root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani is also a major disease that causes significant yield loss in Canada and worldwide in 589 genera of plants including field and horticultural crops, vegetables and ornamentals. Similarly, Sclerotinia rot or white mold caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is also a very damaging disease of 177 genera of 

 21 plants in the United States ; Alternaria alternata is a major pathogen of vegetables , field and horticultural crops and causes disease in 1 10 genera of plants; Fusarium oxyspo ium is a common wilt pathogen and causes significant damage in 156 genera of plants; Fusarium solani, 
 Pythium spp. and Aphanomyces euteiches are common seed decay and root rot pathogens and cause diseases in 105, 92 and 8 genera of plants, respectively; Bipolaris sorokiniana is a common root rot and damping off pathogen and causes common root rot in 52 genera of plants; 
 Fusarium graminearum is a common root rot and head blight pathogen in 18 genera of plants; and Mycosphaerella pinodes is a major pathogen of field pea and recorded in 6 genera of plants in the United States. For the reasons given above, it is believed that the G. roseum strain ofthe present invention controls the diseases caused by the above pathogens in the indicated genus of plants. 
 Thus, on the basis ofthe morphological characterization and mycoparasitic activity ofthe novel 
 G. roseum strain herein disclosed, the effectiveness of this bioagent against fungal pathogens in a range of plant species, not just those herein specifically mentioned, is within the scope ofthe present invention. Specifically, the effectiveness ofthe G. roseum strain is not limited to the treatment of fungal pathogens in crop species, but also displays promise as a biocontrol agent of fungal pathogens in horticultural plant species, and other plants. 
 The primary strain ofthe present invention is G. roseum ACM941. However, it is further believed that other strains of G. roseum, particularly closely related isolates of G. roseum ACM941, display similar antagonist effects against fungal pathogens of plants. Such additional strains, their compositions and methods of use are thus included within the scope ofthe present invention. 
 Thus, according to a first preferred aspect ofthe invention, there is provided a biologically pure culture of a microorganism G. roseum ACM941 , having the identifying characteristics of ATCC # 74447. 
 In accordance with another preferred aspect ofthe present invention, there is provided a composition comprising a culture of G. roseum ACM941 ; and a delivery medium. 
 In accordance with another preferred aspect ofthe present invention there is provided a coated seed comprising a coating of G. roseum ACM941. In accordance with yet another preferred aspect ofthe present invention, there is provided a method for protecting a plant from fungal infection wherein the method comprises the steps of immersing plant seeds in a composition comprising G. roseum ACM941 ; and planting the seeds in a suitable growth medium. 

 In accordance with still another preferred aspect ofthe present invention, there is provided a method of protecting a plant from fungal infection comprising the steps of contacting said plant during a stage ofthe growth of said plant with a strain of a microorganism Gliocladium roseum exhibiting antagonistic effects against a fungal plant pathogen. In accordance with still another preferred aspect ofthe present invention, there is provided a method of controlling fungal plant pathogens, comprising the steps of: providing a delivery medium comprising a culture of a strain of Gliocladium roseum exhibiting antagonistic effects against a fungal plant pathogen; and delivering said delivery medium to plants. 
 In accordance with a still further preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of enhancing the growth and productivity of plants comprising: providing a growth medium containing a strain of Gliocladium roseum exhibiting antagonistic effects against a fungal plant pathogen; and planting plant seedlings or seeds in said growth medium. 
 The primary strain ofthe present invention has been determined to have a distinct genotype different from known strains of G. roseum, and a sample of the strain was deposited on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada (as represented by the Minister of 
 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) (the intended original assignee ofthe present application) under the terms ofthe Budapest Treaty at the American Type Culture Collection of 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, VA 201 10-2209, USA, on June 2,1998, under accession number ATCC # 74447. The use ofthe isolates ofthe present invention for the control of plant pathogens is highly favored over existing chemical alternatives in that it appears not to have adverse effects on non-target organisms, to cause harm to the environment, or to promote pathogen resistance. In the past, biological control agents have been unsuccessful as a result of their inability to propagate in certain soil environments and to promote their parasitic effect for sufficient durations of time. Further, fungal antagonists applied as a seed coating have not routinely colonized the plant rhizosphere. 1   
 As already noted, the strain ofthe present invention displayed versatility in its effectiveness against a range of pathogens, as well as its ability to survive and proliferate in the plant rhizosphere, thus providing a target plant with prolonged protection against invasive pathogens. 
 In addition, the strain of the present invention can be readily propagated in a timely manner, in both solid media and relatively inexpensive liquid media, and applied as seed coatings without difficulty. 

 Moreover, the effectiveness of the isolates against a range of pathogens lends confidence in their ability to effectively protect a wide range of crops affected by other soil- borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens studied. 
 Preliminary studies have indicated the potential for the biocontrol ability ofthe G. roseum ACM941 strain against several major field crop, vegetable and ornamental diseases, including: rhizoctonia root/foot rot of peas, beans, beets, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, canola, cauliflower, cucumber, egg plant, pepper, and tomato; common root rot of wheat and barley; seed-borne phase of fusarium head blight of wheat and barley; Sclerotinia rot, ascochyta foot rot, fusarium root rot, fusarium wilt, aphanomyces root rot, pythium seed decay and root rot, seed-borne phase of alternaria blight, and seed-borne phase of mycosphaerella blight of field pea. 
 Studies ofthe broader applications of G. roseum ACM941 against plant pathogens continue to be conducted in western Canada. It is predicted that these studies will confirm that ACM941 is effective against other crops commonly afflicted by soil-borne and seed-borne fungal pathogens.

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION 
 The present invention provides a biological control agent and delivery system, and methods for controlling root rot diseases in plants. This invention is particularly directed to the isolation of effective strains ofthe fungus Gliocladium roseum, and in particular to the isolation of a novel strain referred to as ACM941. This novel strain of G. roseum exhibits pronounced antagonist effects against a variety of fungal pathogens representing groups of Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Oomycetes and Zygomycetes, known to cause root rot diseases in plants of 

Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. Specifically, the biological control agent ofthe present invention is effective in controlling plant diseases caused by Alternaria alternata, Aphanomyces euteiches, Ascochyta spp., Bipolaris sorokiniana, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. pisi, Fusarium solani f.sp. pisi, Mycosphaerella pinodes, Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, Rhizopus sp., and Sclerotina sclerotiorum. Accordingly, ACM941 is herewith provided in particular as a biocontrol agent suitable for use against PRRC pathogens in field pea and those pathogens causing seed decay, root/foot rots, seedling blight and wilt in other crop plants. 
 The use of ACM941 in treating fungal pathogens causing PRRC diseases, root rots, and the seed-borne phase of fusarium head blight and mycosphaerella blight in plants is an effective alternative to existing chemical products, illustrating increased levels of efficacy, prolonged protection periods, a broader range of pathogenic targets and improved environmental safety. Similarly, ACM941 displays improved capabilities over previously disclosed bioagents effective against root rot pathogens ofthe pea plant. In addition to the effectiveness of ACM941 in treating fungal pathogens, this bioagent can be propagated in an economic and efficient manner. 
 ACM941 is shown to colonize in the plant rhizosphere, as well as proliferate with plant tissues as the target plant develops and grows. This characteristic highlights the advantage of ACM941 over chemical fungicides, which have a limited span of effectiveness, tend to accumulate in the environment and adversely affect non-target organisms. In addition, this confers an economic advantage in that only a limited quantity ofthe bioagent is required to achieve the desire effectiveness. Further, ACM941 is a relatively easy-to-use bioagent which readily propagates in both inexpensive simple liquid media and solid media and can be applied to seeds, soil or plants without difficulty. ACM941 is also compatible with commonly used fungicides. An enhanced effect was generally observed when ACM941 was combined with metalaxyl or low rates of thiram fungicide. 
 The present invention provides a novel and useful alternative for treating and controlling PRRC and other plant pathogens. Specifically, ACM941 has been characterized as having a unique genotype and improved characteristics and mycoparasitic capabilities over existing biocontrol methods for the control of plant pathogens known to cause such afflictions as seed decay, root/foot rots, seedling blight and wilt in a variety of plant species. Further, as most of the plant pathogens tested are common pathogens to a variety of field and horticultural 

crops, vegetables and ornamentals, it is within the scope ofthe present invention to suggest that the antagonistic effects of ACM941 may extend to the treatment of a variety of fungal diseases in a variety of plant species. 
 The ACM941 strain was first identified by the inventor ofthe present invention as a peach coloured growth of fungal mycelia on the surface of some lesions of a pea leaflet during a laboratory isolation of pathogens that cause ascochyta blight on field pea in 1994. The mycelia appeared on the plant tissue after approximately two days under moist chamber laboratory conditions. Close monitoring ofthe lesions revealed that ascochyta blight did not spread when in the presence ofthe peach coloured microbial growth, under the conditions of incubation, for up to five days. In contrast, those lesions absent ofthe microbial growths coalesced rapidly, resulting in leaf rot by the end ofthe five-day incubation period. 
 In view of the effects ofthe peach coloured growth, isolates were transferred to fresh medium and efforts to characterize the microbe were initiated. On the basis of the unique colony morphology and three DNA fingerprints differing from those of existing Gliocladium roseum deposits, the isolate was identified as having a novel genotype. These characteristics are illustrated in Figures 1A and IB, and described in detail herein below. The distinguishing character of colony morphology of G. roseum ACM941 illustrated the lack of a concentric ring growth pattern on PDA medium. Further, the genetic characterization ofthe ACM 941 isolates illustrated differentiating bands of 1.3kb with UBC519 primer, and 0.5kb and 1.3kb with UBC521 primer, in comparison with three other strains of G. roseum, namely DAOM 186891, DAOM 214827 and DAOM 215496, deposited with the Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures, ECORC, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. 
 Tests have shown that seed treatment with G. roseum ACM941 resulted in the control of PRRC diseases, increased emergence, greater fresh and dry weights of plants, better seedling stands and higher yield. More specifically, treatment of seeds of field pea increased emergence by an average of 13%, while yield was shown to increase by 14% over nontreated controls, based on two years of field evaluations in 10 separate field studies conducted in western Canada with eight PRRC pathogens including A. euteiches, P. aphanidermatum, P. ultimum, F. oxysporum f.sp. pisi, F. solani f.sp. pisi, M. pinodes, R. solani, and S. sclerotiorum. As such, the seed treatment of field pea with ACM941 bioagent was at least as effective as Thiram™ or Apron™, the only fungicides registered for use as a seed treatment for pea in western Canada at the time of the study. 

 Seed treatment with G. roseum ACM941 also controlled the seed-borne phase of fusarium head blight and common root rot in wheat and barley; and rhizoctonia root/foot rot in peas, beans, beets, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, canola, cauliflower, cucumber, egg plant, pepper, tomato and marigold. More specifically, treatment of seeds of these crops under artificial inoculation increased emergence by an average of 49%, fresh weight by 43%, dry weight by 61%, and reduced disease severity by 33%, over nontreated controls. These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with registered fungicides. 
 As described in more detail below, the novel G. roseum ACM941 strain was found to be capable of propagating large amounts of spores (in the range of about 7 x 10 6  spores/mL) after 4 - 7 days of incubation at 20° C in an inexpensive liquid medium such as malt extract broth. Alternatively, it was discovered that a maximum sporulation could be achieved after a 3 - 5 day incubation under 25° C - 30° C conditions. The alternative incubation conditions are believed to be favoured under industrial conditions. It was further determined that high levels of light intensity (> 40uEm "2  s " ')and a low initial pH (<4.5) ofthe medium have an inhibitory effect on the spore production of ACM941. 
 A further economic advantage ofthe present invention is the ability of the ACM941 bioagent to propagate within the plant rhizosphere as well as on plant tissues, when applied as a seed coating. In comparison to initial amounts of ACM941 applied to the seed coat of broccoli, carnation, field bean, field pea, tomato and wheat, the bioagent increased 5 to 1463-, 240 to 5160-, and 1 12 to 9173-fold, after 7, 21 and 35 days from seeding, respectively. ACM941 was also recovered from the epicotyl, primary roots and secondary roots after seed treatment of these crops, indicating that the bioagent propagated along with plant tissues as the plant developed. Accordingly, the propagation ofthe bioagent on the surface of plant tissues, as the plant develops and grows, indicates the ability ofthe bioagent to provide effective and long lasting protection against plant pathogens when applied to respective seeds. The ability of ACM941 to survive and propagate within the plant rhizosphere, as well as on the surface of plant tissues, further contributes to the economic efficiency of this bioagent in controlling plant pathogens. 
 Efforts to characterize the mycoparasitic action of the G. roseum ACM941 strain of the present invention revealed that the bioagent acts to entwine the hyphae of its target pathogens. Accordingly, without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is suggested that the antagonistic capabilities of G. roseum ACM941 strain are a result of such entwining action. Consequently, other strains of G. roseum that exhibit the same entwining effect are believed to be effective and within the scope ofthe present invention. 

 In addition to the effectiveness ofthe bioagent alone, an enhanced effectiveness was generally observed when ACM941 was applied as a seed treatment in combination with low rates of a fungicide, for example, thiram or metalaxyl. Such results suggest an alternative use of ACM941 for effectively controlling PRRC pathogens wherein the bioagent ofthe present invention is used in combination with a reduced amount of fungicide, to achieve results at least as effective as existing treatment methods under the appropriate conditions. Accordingly, there would be provided an effective method of controlling PRRC pathogens, while using a reduced amount of chemical fungicide in comparison with existing treatment methods. 
 A final product ofthe bioagent ofthe present invention may be freeze-dried or formed as concentrated spores in a sugar solution. The bioagent ofthe present invention may be used for coating seeds, treating soil or other growth mediums, or for direct application to plants to provide protection against infection by plant pathogens. The methods of propagating the microorganism of the present invention are described below. These methods may be scaled up to commercial levels using conventional liquid fermentation tanks or other conventional methods. 
 EXAMPLE 1 Isolation and Characterization of ACM941 Bioagent (1) Isolation and identification. 
 The G. roseum ACM941 strain was discovered as a peach colored growth of fungal mycelia on the surface of some lesions of a pea leaflet during a laboratory isolation of pathogens that cause ascochyta blight on field pea at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba, Canada in May 1994. The peach coloured growths appeared on the plant tissue after approximately two days under moist chamber laboratory conditions. Close monitoring of the lesions revealed that the ascochyta blight pathogens did not produce spores on the leaf surface and the lesions did not spread when in the presence ofthe peach coloured growth, under the conditions of incubation, for up to five days. In contrast, those lesions absent ofthe growths coalesced rapidly, resulting in abundant sporulations ofthe ascochyta blight pathogens and leaf rot by the end ofthe five-day incubation period. This phenomenon suggested that the peach coloured fungal mycelia growth might have had a strong antagonistic interaction toward the pathogens of ascochyta blight. The fungal mycelia growth was thereafter transferred to a potato dextrose agar medium (PDA) and seven single spore cultures were initially. These cultures were morphologically identical and only one strain designated as ACM941 was further evaluated for the biological control of plant pathogens. 

 12 13 
 Taxonomy of ACM941 was conducted according to standard mycological tests. ACM941 was identified as Gliocladium roseum Bainier based on the formation of two distinct types of conidiophores, penicillate branch and verticillate branch. The identification of ACM941 as G. roseum was confirmed by Dr. K. Seifert, Mycologist, Agriculture and Agri- Food Canada, National Identification Service, Biological Resources Research, ECORC, Ottawa, Ontario, in February 1995. 
 (2) Unique morphological and cultural characteristics. 
 The morphological and cultural characteristics of ACM941 bioagent were examined in comparison with three type cultures of G. roseum isolates, namely DAOM 18689, DAOM 214827, and DAOM 215496. These cultures were deposited at the Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures, ECORC, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. The isolates were compared for growth and cultural characteristics in six different agar media in 9-cm diameter Petri dishes. The media tested were Czapek's, 1.5% malt extract, 2% water agar, PDA Sigma (Sigma PDA 39. Og, distilled water IL), PDA nature (white potatoes 500g, glucose 20g, agar 15g, distilled H 2 0 IL), and V-8 juice agar. Colony diameter was measured with vernier calipers at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after inoculation. Description of colony characteristics was made at 14 days after inoculation. Conidiophore, conidial spore and phialide sizes were measured by growing the isolates on 2% water agar 6 days after inoculation. 
 Compared to the three type cultures of G. roseum, the ACM941 strain was intermediate in growth rate on all six media used, with colony diameter ranging from 9.7 to 12.9 mm, 22.3- 38.9 mm, 39.3-77.6 mm and 52.6-85.0 mm when measured at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after inoculation, respectively. In addition, the ACM941 strain was intermediate in conidiophore, conidium and phialide sizes, with conidiophore ranging from 76.1-1 10.0 x 3.0-3.3 μ , conidium ranging from 6.0-7.1 x 2.7-2.8 μm, and phialide ranging from 23.3-30.6 x 2.5-2.7 μm. Colony morphology of the ACM941 strain was different from the three type cultures of 
 G. roseum by not forming a concentric ring pattern on both PDA (Sigma) and PDA (nature) media, but identical with the type cultures on the other media tested. 
 (3) Genetic Characterization. 
 Genetic composition of the ACM941 strain, in comparison with the three type cultures of G. roseum, DAOM 186891, DAOM 214827 and DAOM 215496, was analyzed in accordance with the protocol for random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD). From each of these original cultures, four single-conidial isolates were derived and used in the present 

 19 study. DNA was extracted from these isolates using the method of Lee and Taylor (1990). Decamer oligonucleotide primers obtained from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada were used with the RAPD analysis. RAPD reactions were performed in a PTC- 100 (Trademark) MJ Research Programmable thermal controller. (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). Gels were subsequently stained with Ethidium Bromide in order to visualize the DNA bands, and photographs were taken using a MP4 Land Camera™ with 667 black and white film (Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, MA) under UV light. 
 A total of 33 random sequence decamer primers were screened for DNA polymorphisms among the isolates of G. roseum. Of these, primers 519 (nucleotide sequence ACC GGA CAC T) and 521 (nucleotide sequence CCG CCC CAC T) produced simple banding patterns that revealed DNA polymorphisms among the isolates (Figure 1 ). The two primers resulted in the detection of eight reproducible amplification products (RAPD markers) from the four G. roseum cultures, but not among the four single spore isolates used for each culture. With primer 519, ACM941 isolates had a differentiating band of 1.3 Kb size, DAOM 186891 had a band of 0.65 Kb and DAOM 214827 had a band of 1.1 Kb size. These three bands were not apparent in the DAOM 215746 isolate, making it different from the other cultures. With primer 521, ACM941 had two differentiating bands of 1.3Kb and 0.5 Kb in size; DAOM 186891 had a unique band of 2.1 Kb; DAOM 214827 had a 1.6 Kb band; and DAOM 215746 had a 0.6Kb band. Accordingly, on the basis ofthe above results, it was determined that each of the four G. roseum cultures were genetically distinct. Specifically, ACM941 illustrated a unique pattern for the two primers selected, compared to the other three type cultures of G. roseum. 
 (4) ATCC Accession Number. A deposit of ACM941 bioagent, as a unique strain of Gliocladium roseum Bainier, was made under the terms of the Budapest Treaty with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, VA 201 10-2209, USA, on June 2, 1998. ACM941 has been designated ATCC Accession # 74447. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Mycoparasitic Activities of ACM941 Bioagent 
 ACM941 was evaluated for mycoparasitism to eight major root rot fungal pathogens including Pythium aphanidermatum, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. pisi, 

Mycosphaerella pinodes, Rhizoctonia solani, Aphanomyces euteiches, Fusarium solani f.sp. pisi., and Sclerotina sclerotiorum. These pathogens were isolated from naturally infected plants in 1997. P. aphanidermatum and A. euteiches fungi were grown on a Difco™ corn meal agar (CMA) medium, and the other pathogens and the ACM941 bioagent were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Mycoparasitism was examined with paired growths of ACM941 bioagent and individual pathogens in 9 cm diameter Petri dishes. Each Petri dish was inoculated with each of a 5-mm diameter mycelium disk of ACM941 and pathogen. A strip of cellophane membrane, cut to 20 x 20 mm, was autoclaved and placed between the bioagent and pathogen in each plate. The mycelium disks were placed 1 - 2 cm away from the cellophane membrane, depending on the growth speed, to ensure that the organisms intersected near the middle ofthe cellophane strip. Inoculated plates were incubated at 20°C under a 12 hour light/dark cycle at 24 wEm ' V 1  light intensity. 
 The cellophane membrane strips were removed from the surface ofthe media, placed on microscopic slides and examined for characteristics of mycoparasitic activity when mycelium intersections had occurred. Cellophane strips were stained with 0.2% Tryptan blue to aid in the visibility of mycelia. Examination was conducted under an objective light microscope and mycoparasitic manifestations were photographed using a Nikon camera with 160 Tungsten positive film (Kodak). 
 Mycoparasitic characteristics of ACM941 were observed on all eight fungal pathogens tested. The mycoparasitism of ACM941 on mycelium of R. solani, A. alternata, M. pinodes, P. aphanidermatum, S. sclerotiorum, F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi, F. solani f. sp. pisi and A. euteiches is illustrated in Figures 2A - H. 
 When growing near pathogen hyphae, ACM941 was often stimulated to produce lateral branches that were attracted directly to the pathogen mycelium. Twining, looping and coiling around the mycelium were characteristic responses of ACM941 to neighboring pathogens, as more clearly illustrated in Figure 3. In most cases, ACM941 appeared to entwine the pathogen mycelium, however, further growth of ACM941 into the encompassed mycelium was not evident. However, penetration and internal growth of hyphae was observed on larger fungi such as A. alternata and R. solani, as illustrated in Figure 4A and Figure 4B. After contact with ACM941, the pathogen mycelium appeared to stop growing, cells became empty due to the loss of cytoplasm and lysis was observed in later stages, as illustrated in Figures 5 A and 5B. 
 To summarize, ACM941 was found to destroy pathogen mycelia only after making physical contact. As such, it can be concluded that the antagonistic effect of ACM941 against 

the pathogens tested was not due to the release of an antibiotic or toxic substance capable of acting at a distance. Accordingly, the mycoparasitic characterization of ACM941 coincided with the results of the greenhouse and field studies reported below. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 Population Proliferation of ACM941 Bioagent in Plant Rhizosphere 
 Proliferation of ACM941 bioagent in the rhizosphere was examined with six different types of plants including broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica, cv. Green Sprouting), carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus, cv. Grenadin), field pea (Pisum sativum, cv. Radley), garden bean (Phaseolus lunatus, cv. Tendergreen Improved), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, cv. Bush Beefsteak) and wheat (Triticum aestivum, cv. AC Domain). Seeds were treated with a concentration of 10^ spores/mL of ACM941 spore suspension at 5.0 mL/kg seed. Nontreated seeds were used as controls. Seeds were planted in 5-inch plastic pots containing large coarse vermiculite at 2.5cm deep and one seed per pot. Seeded pots were placed in a growth room operated at 21 °C with a 16 h photoperiod at 350 mol.  ' ^.s " ' light intensity. Seedlings from ACM941 treated and nontreated seeds were removed from their respective pots 7, 21 and 35 days after seeding and shaken with slight agitation of roots to remove as much vermiculite as possible, without fragmenting the root structure. Where present on the day of observation, those plant segments examined included seed coat, primary root 0-3 cm below seed, primary root at 3- 6cm below seed, epicotyl and stem at 0-3 cm above seed, and secondary roots. ACM941 propagula were removed from each segment of individual plants using 0.1% Tween 20 solution and recovered by series dilutions plated on the Gliocladium selective medium developed by 
 Park et al.™ Colony forming units (CFU) from each plant segment were assessed 6-8 days after inoculation at 20 °C in the dark. ACM941 bioagent was recovered from all the plant segments of the six different types of plants tested (Table 1). Compared to the amount initially introduced onto the seed coat (0 day after seeding), the bioagent increased 5 to 1463, 240 to 5160, and 1 12 to 9173 folds at 7, 21 and 35 days after seeding, respectively. ACM941 was also recovered from low stems (epicotyl or hypocotyl) and primary and secondary roots where it was not applied, indicating that the bioagent had grown along with the development ofthe plants. This rapid increase in the amount of bioagent present in the respective plant tissues observed, was indicative ofthe potential of the bioagent to provide ongoing protection against pathogenic infection.

 EXAMPLE 4 Effect of Concentration and Timing of Post Seed Treatment on the Efficacy of ACM941 
 Seed Treatments (1) Effect of concentrations of ACM941. 
 Seven concentrations of ACM941 spore suspension (5 x 10^, 5 x 10- , 5 x 10^, 
 5 x 10^, 5 x 10", 5 x 10 ', and 1 x 10° spores/mL) were evaluated for their effects on emergence and root rot severity when used as seed treatments. The spore suspensions were prepared by washing colonies of 4 week old cultures, grown on PDA medium, followed by series dilutions. 
 Radley field pea seeds harvested from a diseased field in Morden, Manitoba in 1993 were used in this experiment. The pea seeds were contaminated with Alternaria spp. at 37%, Ascochyta spp. at 5%, Fusarium spp. at 32% and Rhizoctonia solani at 14%. Seeds were treated with the spore suspensions at 5.0 mL/kg seed. Treated seeds were vigorously shaken after the addition ofthe suspensions to ensure uniform coverage ofthe seeds and allowed to air dry before planting. Seeds were planted in wood planting flats (35.5 x 47.0 x 9.0 cm) containing soil mixture of 2: 1 : 1 of soil, perlite and peat moss. For each treatment 50 seeds were planted in each ofthe 4-replicate flats. Planted flats were placed in a growth room maintained at 20°C, with a 14-h photoperiod at 350 mol.m '2 .s " ' light intensity. Emergence was counted 7 days after planting and root rot severity was rated on a scale of 0 (no visible lesions on lower stem and roots, seedling well developed) to 9 (death of plant, seedling died back quickly after emergence) after digging out plants 14 days after planting. This experiment was conducted at AAFC Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1994. Seed treatment with ACM941 increased emergence and reduced root rot severity for all concentrations tested compared to the nontreated control (Table 2). The treatment effects were significant when concentrations were equal to or greater than 5 x 10 5  spores/mL. At a 

concentration of 5 x 10 5  spores/mL, ACM941 increased emergence by 10% and reduced root rot severity by 68%. Concentrations of at least 5 x 10 5  spores/mL were thereafter used in further seed treatment studies.

 (2) Effect of timing of post seed treatment. 
 The shelf life of ACM941 was examined at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 days after seed treatment. Cultivars AC Tamor and Radley field pea seeds harvested from diseased fields in 1995 were used. These seeds were contaminated with Alternaria spp. at 16% and 23%, Ascochyta spp. at 31% and 4%, Fusarium spp. at 22% and 30% and Rhizoctonia solani at 13% and 8%, for AC Tamor and Radley, respectively. The seed treatment procedures, and planting and assessment methods used in this experiment were the same as described above. Treated seeds were kept in a 15°C seed storage room between plantings. This experiment was conducted at AAFC Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1996. 
 For all the post seed treatment timings examined, seed treatment with ACM941 had greater emergence and lower root rot severity compared to nontreated seeds (Table 3). On AC Tamor, ACM941 increased emergence by 22, 23, 35, 63, 20 and 30%. and reduced root rot severity by 70, 60, 75, 88, 44 and 78% after 1 , 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 days of the seed treatment, respectively. Similarly, on Radley pea, ACM941 increased emergence by 58, 27 and 55%, and reduced root rot severity by 91, 100 and 75% after 1, 3, and 14 days ofthe seed treatment, respectively. The results indicated that the seed treatment effectiveness was not reduced even 

after the seeds were treated for 42 days. These results further suggested that the shelf life of ACM941 on treated seeds could be in excess of 42 days.

 EXAMPLE 5 Effect of Temperature and Seeding Dates on the Efficacy of ACM941 Seed Treatments (1) Effect of temperature. 
 The efficacy of ACM941 seed treatments were examined at a range of four temperatures (6°C, 10°C, 15°C, and 20°C) at AAFC Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1994. Temperatures of 6°C, 10°C, and 15°C were provided in growth cabinets and a temperature of 20°C was provided in a growth room. All the growth cabinets and the growth room were provided with a 14-h photoperiod at 350 mol.m "2 . s "1  light intensity. Radley field pea seeds harvested from a diseased field in Morden, Manitoba in 1993 were used. The pea seeds 

were contaminated with Fusarium spp. at 32%, Alternaria spp. at 37%, Ascochyta spp. at 5% and Rhizoctonia solani at 14%. The seed treatment procedures, and planting and assessment methods used in this experiment were the same as described above. 
 Seed treatments with ACM941 increased emergence and reduced root rot severity at all the temperatures tested (Table 4). The seed treatment effects increased with the increase in temperature from 6°C to 20°C, but not significantly different among the temperatures. At 6°C, ACM941 seed treatment increased emergence by 10%, and reduced root rot severity by 84%. At 20°C, the treatment increased emergence by 24% and reduced root rot severity by 89%. These results indicated that the effectiveness of ACM941 seed treatment was not significantly affected with the change of temperature within the 6-20°C range, which is the range of soil temperatures at seeding time and during the growing season for cool season crops. These results further suggest that ACM941 can be effectively employed as a seed treatment for cool season crops.

 *Data in a column under each temperature followed by the same letter are not significantly different at P = 0.05 (LSD). (2) Effect of seeding dates. 
 Field experiments were conducted at the AAFC Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1995 and 1996 to determine the effect of three seeding dates (early, optimum and late) on the efficacy of ACM941 seed treatments in improving emergence and yield of field crops. Certified seed of cultivar AC Tamor and Radley field pea was used in each testing year. For each seeding date, seeds were treated with ACM941 spore suspensions at 10 7  spores/mL and a rate of 5.0 mL/kg seed or with Thiram 75 WP (75% thiram) at 1.0 g a.i./kg seed. The experiments were 

carried out in a split-plot design with seeding dates in the main plots and cultivars and treatments in the subplots on a sandy loam soil in 1995 and a clay loam soil in 1996. The peas were grown in 4-row plots with four replicates per treatment. The plots were 3.0 m long with 30 cm row spacing and 1.2 m apart between plots. The early seeding dates were May 1 and 3, the optimum seeding dates were May 15 and 16, and the late seeding dates were May 29 and 30, for 1995 and 1996, respectively. The seeding rate was 80 seeds per row each year. Standard management practices for Manitoba were followed for weed control and fertilization ofthe crop. Emergence was counted on each plot 4 weeks after planting. Plants were harvested at maturity and the total seed yield and 1000-seed weight were collected when seeds were air dried to 13% seed moisture content. 
 On the average ofthe two cultivars used, seed treatment with ACM941 increased emergence and seed yield for all the seeding dates in the two testing years compared to the nontreated control (Table 5). However, the treatment effects were not observed with cv. Radley when seeded at an optimum date and cv. AC Timor when seeded at a late date in 1996. On the average ofthe two cultivars and the two testing years, ACM941 increased emergence by 6%, 30% and 7%, and yield by 19%, 47% and 6%, for early, optimum and late seeding dates, respectively. These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with thiram seed treatments at the various seeding dates. These results suggest that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for various seeding timings required for cool season crops. Results of this study were also in agreement with previous observations that ACM941 seed treatment was effective in controlling seed and root rot diseases under various temperature conditions.

 EXAMPLE 6 Comparative Evaluation of ACM941 and Registered Fungicides for the Control of Common Root Rot Pathogens in Field Crops, Vegetables, and Ornamentals (1) Efficacy against Rhizoctonia solani. 
 R. solani causes rhizoctonia root rot, which is one ofthe major diseases of pea root rot complex (PRRC) and a major disease of more than 500 genera of plants in the 

 24/1 United States 21 m  *h e  present study, ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of rhizoctonia root rot in four field crops including canola (Brassica napus), field bean (Phaseolus vulgans). field pea (Ptsum sativum) and sugar beet (Beta vulgans), 10 vegetables including table beet (B. vulgans subsp. vulgans), broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica), brussel sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata). cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytts), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), egg plant (Solanum melongena), garden pea (Pisum sahvum), pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), and one ornamental, marigold (Tagetes erecta) in growth room experiments; and on two varieties of field pea in field trials in 1996 - 1997. Certified seeds of these varieties obtained from commercial seed companies were used in these expeπments. Seeds were treated with ACM941 

 
 25 
 at 10 7  spores/mL and 5.0 mL/kg seed. The effectiveness of ACM941 was compared with appropriate fungicides including Vitaflo™ 280 (14.9% carbathiin + 13.2% thiram) at 0.93 g a.i./kg seed for canola and field bean and Thiram 75 WP (75% thiram) at 1.0 g a.i./kg seed for the remaining crops. In growth room experiments, seeds were planted in wood planting flats (35.5 x 47.0 x 
 9.0 cm) containing soil mixture of 2: 1 : 1 of soil, perlite and peat moss. The soil mixture was pasteurized and mixed at about 2% v/v with artificially infested vermiculite that was moistened with 0.4%) malt extract, autoclaved, inoculated with R. solani, and incubated at 20°C for 7 days prior to the planting. The pathogen isolates used in these experiments were in anastomosis group 2 (AG-2) for cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli and brussel sprouts; and AG-4 for the remaining crops. For each treatment 100 seeds were planted in each ofthe 4-replicate flats. The planted flats were placed in a growth room maintained at 20°C and with a 14-h photoperiod at 350 mol.m "2 .s " ' light intensity by fluorescent and incandescent lamps. All experiments were arranged in a completely randomized block design. Emergence was counted 7 days after planting and other parameters were assessed after digging out plants 14 to 16 days after planting. Disease severity was rated on a scale of 0 (no visible lesions on lower stem and roots, seedling is well developed) to 9 (death of plant, the seedling died back quickly after emergence). The experiments were conducted at AAFC Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1995 - 1998. In field experiments, the effectiveness of ACM941 seed treatment was compared with thiram fungicide on two field pea varieties, namely AC Tamor and Radley, at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba on a clay loam soil in 1996 and a sandy loam soil in 1997. Experiments were carried out in a split-plot design with cultivars in the main plots and treatments in the subplots, having four replicates per treatment. Plots were 3.0m long having 4 rows with 30 cm row spacing and 1.2 m between plots. The plots were inoculated with artificially infected wheat seeds that were autoclaved, inoculated with R. solani, incubated at 20°C for 3 - 4 weeks, and air dried. The inoculum was applied to the soil by mixing with pea seeds prior to the seeding and seeded simultaneously at 10 g/row. The seeding rate was 80 seeds per row for both years. Standard management practices for Manitoba were followed for weed control and fertilization ofthe crop. Emergence was counted on each plot 3 weeks after planting. Plants were harvested at maturity and the total seed yield and 1000-seed weight were collected when seeds were air dried to 13% seed moisture content. 
 Seeds treated with ACM941 bioagent had greater emergence, fresh and dry weights and lower rhizoctonia root rot severity than the nontreated controls for all 15 crops tested in growth 

 26 
 room experiments (Table 6). On average, ACM941 increased emergence by 52%, 142% and 9%, fresh weight by 60%, 18% and 28%, and dry weight by 58%, 5% and 20%, and reduced root disease severity by 44%, 27% and 30%, for field crops, vegetables and ornamentals, respectively. On the average of all 15 crops, ACM941 increased emergence by 109%, fresh weight by 28%), dry weight by 20%, and reduced root disease severity by 30%, compared to the nontreated control. These effects were greater than these achieved with fungicide seed treatments, which increased emergence by 105%, fresh weight by 21%, dry weight by 21 %, and reduced root disease severity by 24%. 
 Disease pressure was relatively higher in the field experiments conducted in 1996 than those conducted in 1997 (Table 7). As a result, emergence was generally low for all the treatments and treatment effect was clearly observed in 1996. Compared to the nontreated controls, ACM941 increased emergence by 13% and yield by 16%, on average in the two varieties in 1996. Under the same condition, thiram increased emergence by only 2%, but reduced yield by 12.5%. In 1997, both ACM941 bioagent and thiram fungicide increased emergence significantly. However, these treatments did not increase the yield. The lack of yield advantage of these treatments in 1997 might have been due to the lower disease pressure and high yielding potential of all the treatments and the nontreated controls. Overall, ACM941 increased emergence by 21% and yield by 6% based on the two years of field experiments. These effects were greater than those achieved with commercial fungicide treatments, which increased emergence by 17%, but reduced yield by 10%. 
 The above results suggest that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for controlling rhizoctonia root rot on all crops in both a controlled environment and field conditions. The effectiveness was greater or equal to those achieved with commercial fungicides. (2) Efficacy against Fusarium solani. F. solani is a major pathogen of PRRC and also causes fusarium root rot of more than 
 100 genera of plants in the United States.21  In the preS ent study, ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of fusarium root rot on Radley field pea in growth room experiments and on AC Tamor and Radley field pea in field experiments in 1996-1997, in comparison with the registered fungicide Thiram 75W. The seed treatment procedures, inoculum preparation, inoculation and assessment methods for both growth room and field experiments were the same as described above. 
 ACM941 seeds treatments reduced fusarium root rot severity, increased emergence, plant health and productivity in both growth room and field experiments, compared to the 

 27 nontreated controls In growth room expeπments. ACM941 increased emergence bv 165%. fresh weight by 29%, dry weight by 11%, and reduced root disease seventy bv 32% (Table 
 8) These effects were greater than but not significantly different from those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment Under field conditions. ACM941 mcreased emergence by 7% and 21%. and yield by 6% and 7%. on the average ofthe two vaπeties, m 1996 and 1997, respectively (Table 7) Overall. ACM941 increased emergence by 21% and yield by 6% based on the two years of field expeπments These effects were greater than those achieved with the commercial fungicide, which increased emergence by 15%. but reduced yield by 2% 
 These results indicate that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for controlling fusaπum root rot m both a controlled environment and field conditions The effectiveness was greater than or equal to those achieved with the commercial fungicide

 (3) Efficacy against Fusarium oxysponum. 
 F. oxysporium is also a major pathogen of PRRC and causes wilt diseases in more than 150 genera of plants including field and horticultural crops, vegetables and ornamentals in the 
 21 
 United States. In the present study, ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of fusarium wilt on Radley field pea in growth room experiments and on AC Tamor and Radley field pea in field experiments in 1996 - 1997, in comparison with the registered fungicide Thiram 75W. The seed treatment procedures, inoculum preparation, inoculation and assessment methods for both growth room and field experiments were the same as described above. 
 ACM941 seed treatments reduced fusarium root rot severity, increased emergence, plant health and productivity in both growth room and field experiments, compared to the nontreated controls. In growth room experiments, ACM941 increased emergence by 117%, fresh weight by 9%, dry weight by 12%, and reduced wilt disease severity by 19% (Table 8). These effects were less but not significantly different from those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment. Under field conditions, ACM941 increased emergence by 10% and 30%, and yield by 25%) and 6%, on the average ofthe two varieties, in 1996 and 1997, respectively (Table 7). Overall, ACM941 increased emergence by 20% and yield by 15%. These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with the commercial fungicide, which increased emergence by 30% and yield by 5%. These results indicate that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for controlling fusarium root rot in both a controlled environment and field conditions. Overall, comparison of ACM941 with the fungicide showed that seed treatment with ACM941 had a relatively lower emergence but a greater yield increase. These results reflect the mode of actions ofthe ACM941 bioagent, which kill pathogens by mycoparasitism and protects plants from future pathogen infection by colonizing the plant rhizosphere, as illustrated in previous examples. (4) Efficacy against Mycosphaerella pinodes. 
 M. pinodes is the causal agent of mycosphaerella blight, which is the most important disease of field pea in the world. In addition, M. pinodes causes foliar disease and root rot in six genera of pulse crops in the United States. 21  In the present study, ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of mycosphaerella seedling blight/root rot on Radley field pea in growth room experiments and on AC Tamor and Radley field pea in field experiments in 1996 - 1997, in comparison with the registered fungicide Thiram 75 W. The seed treatment procedures, inoculum preparation, inoculation and assessment methods for both growth room and field experiments were the same as described above. 

 31 
 ACM941 seed treatments reduced mycosphaerella seedling blight/root rot severity, increased emergence, plant health and productivity in both growth room and field experiments, compared to the nontreated controls. In growth room experiments, ACM941 increased emergence by 56%, fresh weight by 4%, dry weight by 1 1%, and reduced root disease severity by 34% (Table 8). These effects were greater than but not significantly different from those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment. 
 Under field conditions, ACM941 increased emergence by 6% and 5%, and yield by 48% and 6%, on the average ofthe two varieties, in 1996 and 1997, respectively (Table 7). Overall, ACM941 increased emergence by 6% and yield by 28%). These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with the commercial fungicide, which increased emergence by 13% and yield by 18%. These results indicate that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for controlling mycosphaerella seedling blight/root rot in both a controlled environment and field conditions. The greater yield improvement of ACM941 relative to the commercial fungicide coincided with the results reported above and further verified the mode of actions of ACM941 bioagent against pathogens, as illustrated in previous examples. (5) Efficacy against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. 
 S. sclerotiorum causes white mold or sclerotinia rot, which is an economically 
 21 important disease on more than 177 genera of plants in the United States. In the present study ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of sclerotinia rot on Radley field pea in growth room experiments and on AC Tamor and Radley field pea in field experiments in 1996- 1997, in comparison with the registered fungicide Thiram 75 W. The seed treatment procedures, inoculum preparation, inoculation and assessment methods for both growth room and field experiments were the same as described above. 
 ACM941 seed treatments reduced sclerotinia rot severity, increased emergence, plant health and productivity in both growth room and field experiments, compared to the nontreated controls. In greenhouse experiments, ACM941 increased emergence by 87%, fresh weight by 14%, and reduced root disease severity by 24% (Table 8). These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment. Neither ACM941 nor thiram fungicide showed an increase in dry weight compared to the nontreated control. Under field conditions, ACM941 increased emergence by 24% and 22%. and yield by 18% and 20%, on the average of the two varieties, in 1996 and 1997, respectively (Table 7). Overall, ACM941 increased emergence by 23% and yield by 19%. These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with the commercial fungicide, which increased emergence by 36% and yield by 6%. 

 32 
 These results indicate that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for controlling sclerotima rot in both a controlled environment and field conditions Once again, the greater yield improvement of ACM941 relative to the commercial fungicide coincided with the results reported above and further veπfied the mode of actions of ACM941 bioagent against pathogens, as illustrated in previous examples

 (6) Efficacy against Fusarium graminearum. 
 F graminearum causes fusanum head blight of wheat and barley, which is the most damaging disease of these crops m the world In addition, the pathogen causes head blight and 
 21 root rot on more than 20 genera of plants in the United States In the present study, ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of seedling blight and root rot on Sceptre wheat and Harrington barley in growth room expenments and in field expenments m 1996 - 1997. m compaπson with the registered fungicide Vιtaflo-280 (14 9% carbathnn + 13 2% thiram) The seed treatment procedures, inoculum preparation, inoculation and assessment methods for both growth room and field expeπments were the same ar descnbed above ACM941 seed treatments, in general, reduced fusanum seedling blight/root rot seventy, increased emergence, plant health and productivity in both growth room and field expenments. compared to the nontreated controls In growth room expenments, ACM941 increased emergence by 7%. fresh weight by 33%, dry weight by 26%, and reduced root disease seventy by 50%, on the average ofthe two crops (Table 8) These effects were greater than but not significantly different from those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment Under field conditions. ACM941 did not show an effect on emergence but increased yield by 1% each year on the average ofthe two vaneties (Table 9) These effects were less but not significantly different from those achieved with the commercial fungicide, which increased emergence by 5% and yield by 3% The lack of seed treatment effect was attributed to the low disease pressure and high v leld potential of these crops in the two years of field expeπments 
 (7) Efficacy against Bipolaris sorokiniana. 
 B sorokiniana is the causal agent of common root rot of wheat and barley, which is an economically important disease of these crops throurrhout the world In addition, the pathogen 
 21 causes leaf blotch and root rot on more than 40 genera of plants in the Umted States In the 

 34 
 present study, ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for the control of common root rot on Sceptre wheat and Harrington barley in growth room experiments and in field experiments in 1996 - 1997, in comparison with the registered fungicide Vitaflo-280 (14.9% carbathiin + 13.2% thiram). The seed treatment procedures, inoculum preparation, inoculation and assessment methods for both growth room and field experiments were the same as described above. 
 ACM941 seed treatments reduced common root rot severity, increased emergence, plant health and productivity in both growth room and field experiments, compared to the nontreated controls. In growth room experiments, ACM941 increased emergence by 30%, fresh weight by 69%, dry weight by 137%, and reduced root disease severity by 20%, on the average ofthe two crops (Table 8). These effects were equal to or greater than those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment. Under field conditions, ACM941 increased emergence by 4% in 1996 and 1 1%> in 1997, on the average ofthe two crops. Neither ACM941 nor Vitaflo-280 fungicide illustrated a yield increase in 1997, but increased yield by 13% and 19% by the respective treatments in 1996 (Table 9). Overall, ACM941 increased emergence by 8% and yield by 4%>. These effects were less but not significantly different from those achieved with the commercial fungicide, which increased emergence by 13% and yield by 7%. These results indicate that ACM941 is an effective seed treatment for controlling common root rot caused by B. sorokiniana in both a controlled environment and field conditions.

 EXAMPLE 7 Comparative Evaluation of ACM941 and Registered Fungicides for the Control of Seed- borne Fungal Pathogens in Field Crops (1) Efficacy against seed-borne fungal pathogens in field pea. The effect of ACM941 seed treatment on the recovery of seed-borne fungal pathogens was evaluated using contaminated seeds of AC Tamor and Radley field peas. The seeds were harvested in 1993 from fields that were severely affected by mycosphaerella blight, moderately affected by powdery mildew and fusarium wilt. Seeds were treated with ACM941 at 10 7  spores/mL and 5.0 mL/kg seed. The effectiveness of ACM941 seed treatment was compared with appropriate fungicides including Captan 50WP (50% captan) at 0.5 g a.i./kg seed or 
 Thiram 75WP (75% thiram) at 1.0 g a.i./kg seed. Treated seeds were plated on potato dextrose agar and incubated at 20°C with a 14-h photoperiod at 350 mol.m^.s "1  light intensity for 14 days. Fungi recovered from the seeds were identified by microscopic examination after this period. Seed treatment with ACM941 reduced all fungal pathogens recovered from the infested seeds (Table 1 1). Specifically, ACM941 reduced the recovery of Fusarium spp. by 75% on the average ofthe two cultivars used, compared to the nontreated controls. This effect was significantly greater than captan fungicide, which had no visible effect on Fusarium spp. and thiram fungicide, which reduced the pathogen by only 2%. ACM941 reduced the recovery of Alternaria spp. by 73% on the average ofthe two cultivars used (Table 11). This effect was equal to or greater than the two fungicides, which reduced the pathogen by 49% and 74%, for captan and thiram, respectively. 
 Similarly, ACM941 reduced the recovery of Ascochyta spp. by 84%, Rhizopus sp. by 71 ), and Rhizoctonia solani by 100%) on the average ofthe two cultivars used, compared to the nontreated controls (Table 1 1). These effects were greater than captan fungicide, which reduced the respective pathogens by 31 ), 69%) and 53%), and thiram fungicide, which reduced the respective pathogens by 40%, 69% and 91%. 
 The above results suggest that when used as seed treatment, ACM941 has a great potential in controlling most or all seed-borne fungal pathogens that may cause seed decay and root rots in crops. These findings coincide with the results of previous examples of ACM941 seed treatments in both controlled environments and field conditions.

 (2) Efficacy against seed-borne phase of fusarium head blight and common root rot in cereals. 
 Seed-bome phase of fusanum head blight and common root rot are economically important diseases of cereals throughout the world In the present study, the effectiveness of ACM941 seed treatment in the control of these diseases was compared with commercial fungicides The expeπments were earned out in a controlled environment using naturally infected seeds of two cultivars of barley (Argyle and Manley) and three cultivars of wheat (Katepwa. Sceptre and Plenty) m the winters 1995 and 1996 Infected seeds of these crops were obtained from fields that were severely affected by fusanum head blight and moderately affected by spot blotch in 1994 Seed infection of Argyle barley was 72%. 16%, 2%, 98%,. and 4%. and for Manley barley was 20%. 98%, 2%, 36%. and 8%. by Fusanum graminearum. Bipolaris sorokiniana, F avenaceum, Alternana alternata, and other Fusarium species, respectively Seed infection of Kαtepwa wheat was 70%, 10%, and 30%, for Sceptre wheat was 68%. 29%. and 21%, and for Plenty wheat was 40%, 8%, and 50% by Fusarium spp . B sorokiniana. and A αlternαtα respectively The seed-bome infection of these pathogens was determined approximately 3 months after harvest, by sampling 200 seeds of each cultivar and plating on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium amended with 1 μg mL streptomv cm sulfate Pathogens growing from the seeds were identified by microscopic examination Seeds were treated with a ACM941 spore suspension of 10 spores/mL at 5 0 mL kg seed or Thiram 75WP at 1 0 g a I /kg seed Treated seeds were planted in wood planting flats (3 5 x 47 0 x 9 0 cm) 

 39 
 containing soil mixture of 2:1 :1 of soil, perlite and peat moss. For each cultivar/crop, 100 seeds were planted in each of the 4-replicate flats for each treatment. The planted flats were placed in a growth cabinet maintained at 20 S C, with a 14-h photoperiod at 350 mol.m "2 . s "1  light intensity by fluorescent and incandescent lamps. Emergence was counted 7 days after planting and other parameters were assessed after digging out plants 14 days after planting. Disease severity was rated using the 0-9 scale described above. 
 In wheat seed treatment, ACM941 increased emergence by 63%, fresh weight by 18%, dry weight by 7%, and reduced root disease incidence by 85% and severity by 85%, on the average of the three cultivars (Table 12). These effects were greater than but not significantly different from those achieved with the fungicide seed treatment, which increased emergence by 55%, fresh weight by 25% and dry weight by 15%, and reduced root rot incidence by 61% and severity by 57%>. 
 In the treatment of barley seed, neither ACM941 nor the fungicide increased the emergence, fresh weight or dry weight (Table 12). Both treatments, however, reduced root rot incidence and severity compared to the nontreated controls. On average ofthe two cultivars used, ACM941 reduced root rot incidence by 44% and severity by 51%. These effects were greater than those achieved with thiram, which reduced the root rot incidence by 31 % and severity by 38%. 
 Results of this study indicate that seed treatment with ACM941 or fungicides is essential in preserving the potential viability of these infected seeds and that ACM941 has a greater or at least equal power in reducing the harmful effect of seed-bome fungal pathogens on subsequent crops in cereals.

 (3) Efficacy against seed-bome phase of mycosphaerella blight in field pea. 
 Mycosphaerella blight, caused by Mycosphaerella pinodes. is the most important disease of field pea throughout the world The seed-bome phase of this disease is considered to be the major source of pnmary inoculum in the subsequent crop year Seed treatment of infected seeds is essential for preventing the seed to seedling transmission and ide spread infections at the foliar stage dunng the plant development In the present study . ACM941 seed treatment was evaluated for improving seedling emergence and yield of M pinodes infected seeds of AC Tamor and Radley field peas, in compaπson with thiram fungicide Field expeπments were conducted at AAFC Research Centre. Morden. Manitoba in 1 95 and 1996 usmg infected seeds obtained from plants naturally infected with pinodes in 1994 and 1995, respectively In each year, seeds of each cultivar were hand-separated into two categoπes 

visibly poor (VP) seeds with lesions or shriveled due to the M. pinodes infection, and healthy- looking (HL) seeds without lesions and smooth. The percentage of seed infection by M. pinodes was determined for 200 randomly selected seeds from each category. Seed infection for VP seeds was 24% and 39% for AC Tamor and 37% and 46% for Radley, and for HL seeds was 9% and 10% for AC Tamor and 5% and 13% for Radley, harvested in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Seeds of each category were treated with ACM941 bioagent spore suspension at 10 7  spores/mL at a rate of 5.0 mL/kg seed or with thiram 75 WP fungicide at 1.0 g a.i./kg seed. The seed treatment procedures, crop management and assessment methods used in these field experiments were the same as described in previous examples. All HL seeds had higher emergence than did that of VP seeds for both cultivars in both 
 1995 and 1996 (Table 13), indicating that the high level of seed-borne infection by M. pinodes is responsible for the lower emergence. Seed treatments with ACM941 or thiram increased emergence of both HL and VP seeds in the two testing years. On average of the two cultivars, ACM941 increased emergence of HL seeds by 54% in 1995 and 17%) in 1996, and emergence of VP seeds by 208% in 1995 and 31%> in 1996. Similarly, thiram increased emergence of HL seeds by 108% and 38%, and emergence of VP seeds by 293% and 55%, in 1995 and 1996, respectively. 
 All HL seeds produced a higher yield than did VP seeds in both 1995 and 1996 (Table 13). On average ofthe two cultivars, ACM941 increased yield of HL seeds by 62% and 39%, and yield of VP seeds by 79% and 3%, in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Thiram increased yield of HL seeds by 106%) in 1995, but decreased yield by 6% in 1996 and increased yield of VP seeds by 148%) and 4% in 1995 and 1996, respectively. 
 Results of this study indicate that seed treatment with either ACM941 bioagent or thiram fungicide facilitates the expression ofthe inherent viability of these pea seeds. Comparison of ACM941 with the standard thiram seed treatment showed that ACM941 had overall a slightly lower emergence but greater yield increase. These results reflect the modes of action of the two seed treatments, as illustrated in previous examples. That is, ACM941 is effective in controlling a number of root rot fungal pathogens by mycoparasitism, and by colonizing the plant rhizosphere, therefore protecting plants from future pathogen infection. Thiram, on the other hand, is a protectant fungicide, which is fungitoxic to pathogens, but short lived.

 EXAMPLE 8 Compatibility and Comparative Evaluation of ACM941 Bioagent and Common Fungicides (1) Comparison and compatibility of ACM941 with thiram fungicide. Thiram 75WP which contains 75% thiram fungicide is a common seed treatment fungicide for seed decay, seedling blights and damping off of field crops, vegetables and ornamentals. In the present study, the effectiveness of ACM941 seed treatment was compared with thiram and rhizobium inoculant Self Stik™ in improving emergence and yield of field pea in field experiments conducted in two different geographic locations in Canada in 1996 and 1997. In addition, a seed treatment of ACM941 with a low rate of thiram was examined for its compatibility and a possible enhanced effectiveness. The experiments were set up on a sandy loam soil in Lacombe, Alberta and on a clay loam soil in Morden, Manitoba each year. Treatments of these experiments were ACM941 10 7  spores/mL at 5.0 mL/kg seed, Thiram 75WP at 1.0 g a.i./kg seed, Rhizobium Self Stik at 1.2g/kg seed, and ACM941 plus 50% ofthe regular rate of thiram (0.5 g a.i./kg seed). Certified seed of two cultivars of field pea, Grande and Radley, was used in these experiments. The experiments were carried out in a split-plot design with cultivars in the main plots and treatments in the subplots, and four replicates per treatment. Plots were 4-row, 2.5 m long with 30 cm row spacing and 1.5 m apart between plots at the Lacombe site, and 3.0m long with 30 cm row spacing and 1.2 m between plots at the Morden site. The seeding rate was 80 seeds per row for both locations in the two testing years. Standard management practices for each province were followed for weed control and fertilization ofthe crop. Emergence was counted for each plot 4 weeks after planting. Plants were harvested at maturity and the total seed yield and 1000-seed weight were collected when seeds were air dried to 13% seed moisture content. High yielding potentials were achieved at the Lacombe site in both testing years (Table 
 14). Pea yield at the Lacombe site was significantly greater than that at the Morden site and the average yield of the field pea production in western Canada in both 1996 and 1997. Because of this high yielding potential, seed treatment effects were not clearly observed at the Lacombe site. On the average of the two cultivars and the two testing years, ACM941 increased emergence by 1%, and yield by 7% compared to the nontreated control. Under the same conditions, thiram increased emergence by 4%, but reduced yield by 4%, rhizobium reduced emergence by 4%, but increased yield by 9%, and ACM941 plus 50% of the regular rate of thiram increased emergence by 1%, and yield by 6%. 

 44 Alternatively, a relatively low yield potential was achieved at the Morden site (Table 14) Under such low yielding conditions, treatment effects were clearly observed On the average ofthe two cultivars and the two testing years, ACM941 mcreased emergence by 13%, and yield by 32% compared to the nontreated control Under the same conditions, thiram increased emergence by 38%, and yield by 29%, rhizobium increased emergence by 14%, and yield by 14%. and ACM941 plus 50% ofthe regular rate of thiram increased emergence by 34%, and yield by 36% 
 On the average ofthe four station years, from the two different geographic sites m western Canada, ACM941 mcreased yield by 19% compared with nontreated controls This effect was greater than thiram fungicide (12%) and the rhizobium moculant (11%) ACM941 plus 50%> ofthe regular rate of thiram was the most effective treatment, which increased yield by 21% These results mdicate that ACM941 bioagent had an equal or greater power in improving seedling emergence and yield in companson with the common fungicide and rhizobium moculant under both high and low yielding conditions The results also indicated that ACM941 bioagent is compatible with thiram fungicide An enhanced effectiveness was generally observed when ACM941 was combined with a low rate of thiram fungicide

 (2) Comparison and compatibility of ACM941 with metalaxyl fungicide. 
 Apron FL which contains 31 7% metalaxyl fungicide is registered for pythium and phytophthora root rots, and downy mildew of field crops, vegetables and ornamentals In the present study, the effectiveness of ACM941 seed treatment was compared with metalaxyl in controlling pythium root rot of field pea m field experiments conducted at AAFC Research Centre in Morden. Manitoba, in 1997 and 1998 In addition, a combination of metalaxyl with 10%) ofthe regular rate of ACM941 was examined for its compatibility and a possible enhanced effectiveness Treatments were ACM941 10 7  spores/mL at 5 0 mL/kg seed. Apron FL at 0 16 g a l /kg seed, and Apron FL plus 10% ofthe regular rate of ACM941 (10 6  spores/mL at 5 0 mL/kg seed) Certified seed of Saturn field pea. which is highly susceptible to pythium root rot. was used in these expeπments The experiments were set up on a clay loam soil in 1997 and a sandy loam soil m 1998 with four replicates per treatment The plot size, crop management and assessment methods used in these field expeπments ere the same as descπbed above The plots were inoculated with particles of vermiculite that had been moistened with 15% of V-8 juice solution at 5 1 of vermiculite V-8 solution and infected with Pythium aphanidermatum 

 46 
 The infected vermiculite particles were incubated at 20°C for 3-4 weeks, and distributed to the plot area at 50 mL/m^ prior to the seeding. 
 The emergence and yield were much poorer, however, the treatment effects were greater in 1997 than 1998 (Table 15). On the average ofthe two testing years, treatments of ACM941 alone increased emergence by 16.5% and yield by 20.4%, compared to the nontreated controls. This effect was equal to or greater than those achieved with metalaxyl, which increased emergence by 17.3% and yield by 19.5%. An enhanced effectiveness was observed with the treatment of metalaxyl plus 10% ofthe regular rate of ACM941 bioagent, which increased the emergence by 21.2% and yield by 41.1 %. These results coincided with previous findings that ACM941 bioagent had an equal or greater power in controlling pythium root rot and improving plant health and yield compared to the commercial fungicide. Results of this study also indicated that ACM941 bioagent is compatible with metalaxyl fungicide. An enhanced effectiveness was generally observed when ACM941 was combined with metalaxyl fungicide.

 EXAMPLE 9 Liquid Fermentation of ACM941 Bioagent 
 As the first step of industrial production of ACM941 bioagent, a series of nine experiments were conducted to determine the optimum conditions for fermenting ACM941 bioagent at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1996 - 1997. Various media were prepared and added to 125-mL Erlenmeyer flasks with cotton and cheesecloth plugs at 50mL medium per flask and three replicate flasks per treatment. These flasks were autoclaved for 15 minutes at 121 °C and 21 psi. Each flask was then inoculated with a disc of ACM941 cut with 5-mm-diameter cork borer from the edge of 4 week old culture of ACM941 bioagent on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Flasks were shaken continuously on an orbital shaker at 1 10 rpm at 20°C, under 16-h light and 8-h dark at 24uEm  2 s _1  light intensity. Sporulation was assessed at 4 and 7 days after inoculation, respectively. 
 In experiment I, six carbon sources, including four simple carbohydrates (glucose, maltose, malt extract, sucrose) and two complex carbon or nutrient sources (glycerol, yeast extract + glucose) were tested for their effects on spore production in the basal Czapek's salt medium (BCSM). These carbon sources were added to BCSM at the rate of 20g/L for the simple carbohydrates and at lOg/L for the complex carbon or nutrient sources. Ofthe six carbon sources tested, malt extract in BCSM had the greatest sporulation, which was nearly 10 - fold greater than any other carbon sources tested (Table 16). In experiment II, Malt extract alone and in combination with BCSM were tested. Malt extract alone provided an equal to or greater level of spore production than that of malt extract plus BCSM (Table 16). BCSM was thereafter not used in further fermenting experiments. 
 In experiment III, eight concentrations of malt extract medium (5g/L, lOg/L, 20g/L, 30g/L, 40g/L, 60g/L, 80g/L, and 120g/L) were tested for their effects on ACM941 spore production. The treatment of 120g/L of malt extract had the greatest spore production but not significantly different from treatments of 40g/L, 60g/L and 80g/L (Table 16). The concentration of 40g/L of malt extract was thereafter used in further experiments. 
 In experiment IV, initial inocula of ACM941 from five different sources were evaluated for their sporulation potential in 40g/L malt extract broth medium. These treatments were: 1) mycelium from the growing edge of a 1 week-old culture on water agar (WA-lwk); 2) mycelium from the growing edge of a 2 week-old culture on PDA (PDA-mycelium-2wk); 3) mycelium with minimal sporulation from the edge of a 4 week-old culture on PDA (PDA- mycelium-4wk); 4) clumps of sporulating mycelium from the edge of 4 week-old culture on 

 48 
 PDA (PDA-spore-edge-4wk); and 5) sporulating mycelium from the center of a 4 week-old culture on PDA (PDA-spore-centre-4wk). Ofthe five different initial inocula of ACM941 bioagent tested, PDA-spore-edge-4wk and PDA-spore-centre-4wk had equal and significantly greater potential in sporulation than other treatments (Table 16), and were thereafter used in further experiments. 
 In experiment V, different aeration conditions were tested for their effect on sporulation potential of ACM941 in 40g/L malt extract broth medium using three different sizes of Erlenmeyer flasks (125mL, 250mL, and 500mL) with two speeds of agitation (90rpm and 1 lOrpm). Treatment with 125mL Erlenmeyer flask shaken at 90 rpm had a significantly higher level of spore production than other treatments (Table 16). The results indicate that a reduced aeration would have a positive impact on sporulation, which facilitates increased volumes in an industrial fermentation process. 
 In experiment VI, three light intensity levels were evaluated for their effect on sporulation potential of ACM941 in 40g/L malt extract broth medium. These treatments were: 1) direct lighting at 24uEm " V; 2) ambient room light at lOuEm ' V 1 ; and 3) dark (flasks covered with tin foil and placed with ambient light treatment). The direct lighting treatment had greatest spore production compared to other treatments, but was not significantly different from ambient light treatment (Table 16). Dark treatment had the lowest spore production, indicating that light is required for the optimum spore production of ACM941 bioagent. In experiment VII, five initial pH levels (3.0, 3.5, 4.5 (pH of non-adjusted medium), 
 5.5, and 7.0) ofthe malt extract medium were tested for their effects on sporulation of ACM941. The various levels of pH were adjusted using Fisher Brand pH meter by adding 1 N HCl or NaOH solution before the fermentation process. Treatments with initial pH of 4.5 (not adjusted malt extract broth medium) and pH adjusted to 7.0 had the similar greatest level of sporulation compared to other pH levels tested (Table 16). The non-adjusted pH level (4.5) of malt extract medium was thereafter used in further experiments. 
 In experiment VIII, two temperatures (20°C and 30°C) and two malt extract concentrations (20g/L and 40g/L) were tested for their combined effects on ACM941 sporulation. Treatment of 40g/L malt extract broth at 30°C had the greatest spore production and was significantly different from other treatments (Table 16), indicating that the relatively high temperature may have a positive impact on the sporulation. 
 In experiment IX, three temperatures (25°C, 30°C, and 33°C), two malt extract concentrations (40g/L and 120g/L) and two light intensities (24uEm "2 s " ' and 60uEmV) were 

 49 
 tested for their combined effects on ACM941 sporulation. Due to the technical constraint, the light intensity of 24uEm " V was provided only at 25°C and 60uEm " V light intensity at 30°C and 33°C. Treatment of 40g/L malt extract broth at 25°C and with light intensity of 24uEm "2 s " ' had the greatest spore production compared to other treatments (Table 16). Treatments with 120g/L did not produce the higher sporulation than treatments with 40g/L as observed in previous experiments. The treatment of 40g/L of malt extract at 30°C had also not provided higher sporulation potential as observed earlier. These may have been due to the inhibitory effect of the higher light intensity used (όOuEm ' V 1 ) for treatments with 30°C and 33°C. These results suggest that temperatures of 30°C or lower and light intensity of less than όOuEmfV 1  are required for an optimum spore production. 
 The results of these fermenting experiments suggest that ACM941 can be effectively produced using inexpensive media. Based on this information, Chr. Hansen BioSystems in Milwaukee, Wisconsin produced the first batch of 40 g of freeze-dried commercial preparation of ACM941 in their pilot-plant in March 1999. These results suggest that large-scale fermentation of ACM941 for the purpose of industrial production would be easily attainable.

 EXAMPLE 10 Effect of Media and Fermentation Methods on the Efficacy of ACM941 Seed Treatments 
 A comparative evaluation of ACM941 bioagent, produced from liquid fermentation (LF) and solid medium (SM), for their efficacy in seed treatment was conducted in growth room experiments at AAFC Research Centre, Morden, Manitoba in 1997 ACM941 spore suspension from SM was prepared by washing the colony of a 4 week old culture, grown on PDA medium ACM941 spore suspension from LF was prepared from 5 day-old 4%> malt extract broth, concentrated by centπfiigation for 10 min at 2000 rpm at 4°C. and resuspended m 0 1% Tween 20 The suspensions were tested on AC Tamor field pea seeds, which were harvested in 1996 from fields that were severely affected by mycosphaerella blight, moderately affected by Fusanum wilt and powdery mildew Seeds were treated with the spore suspensions at 10 spores/mL and 5 0 mL/kg seed Seeds were planted at 6 hours and 24 days after treatment m wood planting flats (35 5 x 47 0 cm) contaming soil mixture of 2 1 1 of soil, perlite and peat moss. For each planting, 40 seeds were planted in each ofthe 4 replicate flats for each treatment Remaining treated seeds were kept in a 3 7°C walk-in refrigerator between the plantings The planted flats were placed in a growth cabinet maintained at 20°C. with a 14-h photoperiod at 350 mol m "2  s "1  light intensity by fluorescent and incandescent lamps Emergence was counted 7 days after planting and disease seventy was rated 14 days after planting using the 0 - 9 scale descπbed above ACM941 spores produced from both LF and SM were effective in increasing emergence and reducing the root rot severity when used as seed treatments (Table 17) In companson with the nontreated controls. ACM941 from LF increased emergence by 148% and 116% when planted 6 hours and 24 days after seeds were treated, respectively These effects were equal to those achieved with ACM941 spores produced from SM. which increased 

 52 emergence by 92% and 144%, at 6 hours and 24 days after seeds were treated, respectively. Neither ACM941 LF nor ACM941 SM treatments showed effects in reducing root rot severity when seeded the same day after seed treatment. However, both treatments reduced the root rot severity by 18% when seeded 24 days after the seed treatment. A reduced effect was not observed after seeds were treated and stored for 24 days. The findings of this experiment coincide with the previous results which indicate that ACM941 bioagent has a long shelf life on seeds.
