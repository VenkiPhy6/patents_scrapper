The present invention further relates to uses and kits.      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Necrotic enteritis is an economically important disease in poultry species. It arises as a result of a pathogenic Clostridium perfringens infection, which is often concomitant with coccidiosis infection. In extreme cases, it results in high levels of mortality and at .a sub-clinical level results in intestinal damage and detrimental impacts on animal performance.  Necrotic enteritis in poultry, and negative effects thereof on performance has primarily been controlled by the use of in-feed antibiotics. However, the ban on the use of in-feed antibiotics as growth promoters and consumer pressure to reduce the use of antibiotic application to meat production animals, has made it more difficult for producers to prevent losses arising from aperfringes and associated sub-clinical or clinical necrotic enteritis.  There is therefore an opportunity to offer solutions which limit or prevent the damage caused by C. perfringens. One such solution has been to use probiotics to promote a healthy gut microflora and a stable enterological ecosystem. However further benefits have been observed with supplementation with enzymes such as proteases and carbohydrases. Although combinations of DFMs with some enzymes have been contemplated, the interaction between DFMs and enzymes has never been fully understood. The present invention relates to novel specific combinations which surprisingly significantly improve production performance characteristics in animals. Monogastric animals are known to contain no or negligible amounts of endogenous phytase in the stomach and small intestine, and are therefore dependent on supplemental plant and/or microbial or fungal phytase for hydrolization of phytic acid in the proximal digestive tract (Pallauf, J. and Rimbach, G. Arch. Anim. Nutr, 1997, Vol.50, pp 301-319). Additional phytase is often added to the feed of monogastric animals, such as poultry and swine feed.  Phytate is the major storage form of phosphorus in cereals and legumes.  Through the action of phytase, phytate is generaly hydrolysed to give lower inositol-phosphates and inorganic phosphate.  
 2 The present invention seeks to overcome some of the problems associated with a reduced beneficial effect of phytase enzymes in animals subject to clinical or sub-clinical necrotic enteritis. The present invention further seeks to overcome the problems associated with the anti-:5    nutritional properties of phytic acid, particularly in animals subject to clinical or sub-clinical necrotic enteritis, leading to improved availability of nutrients, minerals, vitamins and energy and consequently improved bio-physical characteristics of monogastric animals SUMMARY OF INVENTION A seminal finding of the present invention is that the inventors have found that there is an unexpected synergistic effect in the combination of at least one DFM and high levels (>1500FTU/kg feed) of phytase, which has been shown to improve performance of a subject to a level greater than that of a positive control with low levels of C.  perfringens and no necrotic enteritis. The inventors have demonstrated this by considering percentage mortality, body weight gain and FOR for example. These positive effects were completely unexpected. Without wishing to be bound by theory the inventors believe these affects may be due to a reduced levels of damage to the intestines as a result of pathogen (e.g.  Clostridium perfringens and/or Escherichia coil challenge), compared to the control. The improved performance of animals may be accounted for through the prevention of the establishment and pathology of harmful bacteria in the gut. In addition it is believed that other beneficial effects of the invention include increased hydrolysis of phytate, which results in increased ileal digestibility of proteins and minerals. In addition to the benefit of increasing nutrient availability to the subject, this can also result in less substrate reaching the hind-gut for fermentation by bacteria, making it harder for the pathogens in the gut to establish.  Another benefit of the present invention is the reduced mucin production compared to when phytase is not supplemented. As a result there is a lower level of endogenous losses and again less substrate for fermentation by gut microflora. In particular, a seminal finding of the present invention is that at least one direct fed microbial (DFM) in combination with high levels (>1500FTU/kg feed) of phytase has significant beneficial effects on the performance of an animal, including improving one or more of the following: feed conversion ratio (FOR), ability to digest a raw material (e.g.  nutrient digestibility, such as amino acid digestibility), nitrogen retention, survival, carcass yield, growth rate, weight gain, feed efficiency, animals resistance to necrotic enteritis, immune response of the subject.

The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that such publications constitute prior art to the claims appended hereto. The enzymes for use in the present invention can be produced either by solid or submerged culture, including batch, fed-batch and continuous-flow processes.     Culturing is accomplished in a growth medium comprising an aqueous mineral salts medium, organic    ' growth factors, the carbon and energy source material, molecular oxygen, and, of course, a starting inoculum of one or more particular microorganism species to be employed. The direct fed microbial (DFM) for use in the present invention may be an antipathogen direct fed microbial. The term "antipathogen DFM" as used herein means a DFM  that inhibits (e.g. decreases or prevents) intestinal establishment of pathogenic microorganism (such as Clostridium perfringens and/or E. coil and/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp., preferably Clostridium perfringens and/or E. coli).. The "DFM ASSAY" taught hereinbelow may be used to determine whether the DFM is an antipathogen DFM. In one embodiment the DFM for use in the present invention is selected as an inhibitory strain (or an antipathogen DFM) when assessed with the "DFM ASSAY" taught herein. Suitably the DFM for use in the present invention may inhibit one (or more) of the following pathogens: Clostridium spp, such as Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, and/or E. coil and/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp, preferably at least one (or more) of the following pathogens: Clostridium spp, such as Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, and/or E. coll. In one embodiment the DFM for use in the present invention may inhibit one (or more) of the following pathogens: Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile and/or E. coil, preferably Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, more preferably Clostridium perfringens. In one embodiment the subject may be challenged by a pathogen, such as one or more of the following pathogens: Clostridium spp, such as Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, and/or E. coli and/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp. In one embodiment the subject may be challenged by Clostridium perfringens and/or E. coll.      The DFM for use in the present invention is suitably a viable bacterium. The present invention relates to high phytase dosages.     Conventionally phytase is dosed in the region of about 500FTU/kg feed e.g. for broilers and turkeys, and as is conventionally doses in the region of about 300FTU/kg feed for laying hens for example. In contrast in the present invention the phytase is dosed in (or with) the feedstuff at a level of 5    at least 1500FTU/kg feed, suitably at least 2000FTU/kg feed, suitably at least 3000FTU/kg feed, suitably at least 5000FTU/kg feed, such as at least 10000FTU/kg feed. As will be understood by one skilled in the art, the level of phytase in the feed additive composition must be sufficient to allow the phytase to be dosed in the feedstuff at a level of at least 1500FTU/kg feed, suitably at least 2000FTU/kg feed, suitably at least 3000FTU/kg  
 10    feed, suitably at least 5000FTU/kg feed, such as at least 10000FTU/kg feed. The present inventors have found that significant benefits can be obtained by administering high phytase levels in combination with DFMs. In contrast, increasing the dose of phytase alone causes no significant benefits (e.g. no significant improvements in feed conversion ratios etc.). In sharp contradistinction when the dose of phytase is increased in combination with at least one DFM (particularly at least antipathogen DFM) ¨ then significant and unexpected benefits are observed. This was completely unexpected. Suitably the DFM for use in the present invention is a mixture of at least two DFMs, suitably at least three DFMs. In one embodiment the DFM for use in the present invention comprises (or consists essentially of or consists of) a bacterium from one or more of the following genera: Bacillus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus,Saccharomyces, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Aspergillus and combinations thereof.

Suitably, the DFM may comprise a yeast from the genera: Saccharomyces spp. Preferably the DFM to be used in accordance with the present invention is a microorganism which is generally recognised as safe and, which is preferably GRAS approved. A skilled person will readily be aware of specific species and or strains of microorganisms from within the genera described herein which are used in the food and/or agricultural industries and which are generally considered suitable for animal consumption. Preferably, the DFM used in accordance with the present invention is one which is suitable for animal consumption.   =     Advantageously, where the product is a feed or feed additive composition, the viable DFM  should remain effective through the normal "sell-by" or "expiration" date of the product during which the feed or feed additive composition is offered for sale by the retailer. The desired lengths of time and normal shelf life will vary from feedstuff to feedstuff and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognise that shelf-life times will vary upon the type of feedstuff, the size of the feedstuff, storage temperatures, processing conditions, packaging material and packaging equipment. In some embodiments it is important that the DFM is tolerant to heat, i.e. is thermotolerant.  This is particularly the case where the feed is pelleted. Therefore in one embodiment the DFM may be a thermotolerant microorganism, such as a thermotolerant bacteria, including for example Bacillus spp. In some embodiments it may be preferable that the DFM is a spore producing bacteria, such as Bacilli, e.g. Bacillus spp. Bacilli are able to from stable endospores when conditions for growth are unfavorable and are very resistant to heat, pH, moisture and disinfectants. In one embodiment suitably the DFM may decrease or prevent intestinal establishment of pathogenic microorganism (such as Clostridium perfringens and/or E. coli and/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp., preferably Clostridium perfringens and/or E.  coil). The DFM according to the present invention may be any suitable DFM. In one embodiment the following assay "DFM ASSAY" may used to determine the suitability of a microorganism .. to be a DFM. For the avoidance of doubt in one embodiment a DFM selected as an inhibitory strain (or an antipathogen DFM) in accordance with the "DFM ASSAY" taught herein is a suitable DFM for use in accordance with the present invention, i.e. in the feed additive composition according to the present invention.      DFM ASSAY: Tubes were seeded each with a representative pathogen from a representative cluster.  Supernatant from a potential DFM grown aerobically or anaerobically was added to the seeded tubes and incubated. After incubation, the optical density (OD) of the control and supernatant treated tubes was .. measured for each pathogen. Colonies of (potential DFM) strains that produced a lowered OD compared with the control were classified as an inhibitory strain (or an antipathogen DFM). The DFM assay as used herein is explained in more detail in US2009/0280090.  Preferably the representative pathogen used in assay is one (or more) of the following:  Clostridium, such as Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, and/or E. co/land/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp. In one preferred embodiment the assay is conducted with one or more of Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile and/or-E.  coil, preferably Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, more preferably Clostridium perfringens. In one embodiment the DFM of the present invention is preferably an antipathogen. The term "antipathogen" as used herein means that the DFM counters an effect (e.g. a negative effect) of a pathogen. In one embodiment to determine if a DFM is an antipathogen in accordance with the present invention the above mentioned DFM assay may be used. A DFM is considered to be an antipathogen or an antipathogen DFM if it is classed as an inhibitory strain in the above mentioned DFM assay, particularly when the pathogen is Clostridium perfringens. In one embodiment the antipathogen DFM may be one or more of the following bacteria: Bacillus subtilis strain 2084 Accession No. NRRL B-50013, Bacillus sub fills strain LSSA01 Accession No. NRRL B-50104, Bacillus sub fills strain 15A-P4 ATCC Accession No. PTA-6507, Bacillus subtilis strain 3A-P4 ATCC Accession No. PTA-6506, and Bacillus subblis strain BS27 ATCC Accession No. NRRL B-50105. For the avoidance of doubt these strains are available and are referred to in US 7,754,459 B. In one embodiment the DFM used in accordance with the present invention is not Lactobacillus gasseri BNR 17 Strain Ace No. KCTC 10902BP as taught in W02008/016214. Preferably the DFM is not an inactivated microorganism. In one embodiment the DFM as used here is a composition comprising one or more DFM  microorganisms as described herein. The composition may additionally comprise the enzyme of the present invention.      The composition can be fed to an animal as a direct-fed microbial (DFM). One or more carrier(s) or other ingredients can be added to the DFM. The DFM may be presented in various physical forms, for example, as a top dress, as a water soluble concentrate for use as a liquid drench or to be added to a milk replacer, gelatin capsule, or gels.

Suitably when the phytase is present in the feed additive composition in the dosages given above the direct fed microbial is present in the feed additive composition in a range from 2.5x103CFU DFM: 1FTU enzyme to 6.7x106CFU:1FTU enzyme, suitably in a range from 3.8x103CFU DFM: 1FTU enzyme to 2.0x105 CFU:1 FTU enzyme. It will be understood that as used herein 1 FTU (phytase unit) is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 viol of inorganic orthophosphate from a substrate in one minute under the reaction conditions defined in the ISO 2009 phytase assay - A  standard assay for determining phytase activity and 1 FTU can be found at International Standard ISOIDIS 30024: 1-17, 2009. In one embodiment suitably the enzyme is classified using the E.G.  classification above, and the E.C. classification designates an enzyme having that activity when tested in the assay taught herein for determining 1 FTU.    Advantages The interaction of DFMs with enzymes is complicated and without wishing to be bound by theory, it is very surprising that we can see an improvement in the subject's resistance to necrotic enteritis. Prior to the present invention the specific combination of DFMs and high phytase (e.g. as taught herein) had not been taught for this specific purpose. In addition or alternatively in terms of animal performance, e.g. feed conversion ratio, there is a synergistic effect in the combination of a DFM (e.g. antipathogen DFM) with phytase, when the phytase is dosed above 1500 FTU/kg feed. When phytase is supplemented alone, there is an increase in performance (i.e. reduction in FCR) at 500 and 1500 FTU/kg feed and a reduction in performance (i.e. an increase in FCR) when the phytase dose exceeds about 1500FTU/kg feed. This is particularly true in the conditions of a necrotic enteritis challenge.  However, when the DFM is added in combination with phytase above 1500FTU/kg feed, there is a consistent numerical increase in performance (i.e. reduction in the FCR) compared to the phytase only treatments. Between the level of 3000 FTU/kg feed and 10,000 FTU/kg feed there is a large numerical reduction which results in the lowest FCR of all of the treatment groups. Surprisingly the combination of DFM (particularly antipathogen DFM) with phytase at more than 1500FTU/kg feed results in a synergistic combination. An advantage of the present invention is that the combination of DFMs (e.g.  antipathogen) DFMs with high dose phytase significantly improves the efficacy of the phytase to improve animal performance and/or phosphorus retention in a subject. A further advantage of the present invention is the combination of DFMs (e.g.  antipathogen) DFMs with high dose phytase improves phosphorus (e.g. dietary phosphorus) absorption and retention in a subject. This combinational effect was completely unexpected. One advantage of the present invention is that the feed additive composition according to the present invention can avoid the negative effects of necrotic enteritis or can be used for improving the subject's resistance to necrotic enteritis. Without wishing to be bound by theory, phytase catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of phytate, a principal storage form of phosphorus in cereals and legumes, to less phosphorylated myo-inositol derivatives with concomitant release of inorganic phosphate. Hydrolysis of phytate causes a reduction of endogenous losses of amino acids to the intestinal lumen. A reduction of endogenous amino acid losses in the intestine reduces the availability of nitrogen for bacterial growth, which helps the activity of DFMs on inhibition of C. perfringens and other pathogenic bacteria. Without wishing to be bound by theory adding phytase enzymes and hydrolysing phytate, can result in an increase in the pH of the small intestine (duodenum, jejenum and/or ileum). Phytase may also actually increase the amount of bacteria of species E. coil and C.  perfringens. This may be associated with a higher pH. The present inventiors have found that the addition of a DFM (particularly an antipathogen DFM) with high doses of phytases may offset the increase in pathogenic bacteria. High doses of phytase increase the hydrolysis of phytic acid in the gut of animals, which can have advantages for increased digestibility of phosphorus, calcium, energy, protein and other nutrients and possibly animal performance. Surprisingly, however, the inventors have found that high doses of phytase cannot achieve the potential improvements on nutritent digestibility and animal performance when clinical or subclinical intestinal disease challenge is present, e.g. necrotic enteritis in broilers, which is a common occurrence in commercial animal production. By combining high doses of phytases with an antipathogenic DFM the inventors have surprisingly found that animal performance is further enhanced even at very high levels of phytase (e.g. 10,000FTU/kg feed). In combination high dosages of phytase and DFMs surprisingly provides a significant improvement on the pathogen reduction and/or resistance to necrotic enteritis and/or feed conversion ratio, and/or body weight gain and/or performance of a subject and/or reducing nutrient excretion in manure compared with DFMs in combination with standard (low) phytase dosages and/or DFMs alone and/or enzyme (even high dosage phytase) alone.

A  fish food normally contains macro nutrients, trace elements and vitamins necessary to keep captive fish in good health. Fish food may be in the form of a flake, pellet or tablet. Pelleted forms, some of which sink rapidly, are often used for larger fish or bottom feeding species. Some fish foods also contain additives, such as beta carotene or sex hormones, to artificially enhance the color of ornamental fish. The term feed in the present invention also encompasses in some embodiment bird food.  Bird food includes food that is used both in birdfeeders and to feed pet birds. Typically bird food cornprises of a variety of seeds, but may also encompass suet (beef or mutton fat). As used herein the term "contacted" refers to the indirect or direct application of the composition of the present invention to the product (e.g. the feed). Examples of the application methods which may be used, include, but are not limited to, treating the product in a material comprising the feed additive composition, direct application by mixing the feed additive composition with the product, spraying the feed additive composition onto the product surface or dipping the product into a preparation of the feed additive composition.  In one embodiment the feed additive composition of the present invention is preferably admixed with the product (e.g. feedstuff). Alternatively, the feed additive composition may be included in the emulsion or raw ingredients of a feedstuff. For some applications, it is important that the composition is made available on or to the surface of a product to be affected/treated. This allows the composition to impart one or more of the following favourable characteristics: performance benefits. The feed additive compositions of the present invention may be applied to intersperse, coat and/or impregnate a product (e.g. feedstuff or raw ingredients of a feedstuff) with a controlled amount of DFM and enzyme(s). The DFM and enzyme(s) may be used simultaneously (e.g. when they are in admixture together or even when they are delivered by different routes) or sequentially (e.g. they may be delivered by different routes). In one embodiment preferably the DFM and enzyme(s) are applied simultaneously. Preferably the DFM and enzyme(s) are admixed prior to being delivered to a feedstuff or to a raw ingredient of a feedstuff. The DFM in feed additive compositions according to the present invention - can be added in suitable concentrations ¨ such as for example in concentrations in the final feed product which offer a daily dose of between about 2x10  CFU to about 2x1011 CFU, suitably between about 2x106 to about 1x1010, suitably between about 3,75x107 CFU to about 1x101  CFU.  Preferably, the feed additive composition of the present invention will be thermally stable to heat treatment up to about 70  C; up to about 85 C; or up to about 95 C. The heat treatment may be performed for up to about 1 minute; up to about 5 minutes; up to about 10 minutes; up to about 30 minutes; up to about 60 minutes. The term thermally stable means that at least about 75% of the enzyme components and/or DFM that were present/active in the additive before heating to the specified temperature are still present/active after it cools to room temperature. Preferably, at least about 80% of the enzyme components and/or DFM that were present and active in the additive before heating to the specified temperature are still present and active after it cools to room temperature. In a particularly preferred embodiment the feed additive composition is homogenized to produce a powder. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the feed additive composition is formulated to granules as described in W02007/044968 (referred to as TPT granules) incorporated herein by reference. In another preferred embodiment when the feed additive composition is formulated into granules the granules comprise a hydrated barrier salt coated over the protein core. The advantage of such salt coating is improved thermo-tolerance, improved storage stability and protection against other feed additives otherwise having adverse effect on the enzyme and/or DFM. Preferably, the salt used for the salt coating has a water activity greater than 0.25 or constant humidity greater than 60 % at 20  C. Preferably, the salt coating comprises a Na2SO4. The method of preparing a feed additive composition may also comprise the further step of pelleting the powder. The powder may be mixed with other components known in the art.  The powder, or mixture comprising the powder, may be forced through a die and the resulting strands are cut into suitable pellets of variable length. Optionally, the pelleting step may include a steam treatment, or conditioning stage, prior to formation of the pellets. The mixture comprising the powder may be placed in a conditioner, e.g. a mixer with steam injection. The mixture is heated in the conditioner up to a specified temperature, such as from 60-100 C, typical temperatures would be 70 C, 80 C, 85 C, 90 C  or 95 C. The residence time can be variable from seconds to minutes and even hours.  Such as 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minutes, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour. It will be understood that the feed additive composition of the present invention is suitable for addition to any appropriate feed material.     As used herein, the term feed material refers to the basic feed material to be consumed by an animal. It will be further understood that this may comprise, for example, at least one or more unprocessed grains, and/or processed plant and/or animal material such as soybean meal or bone meal. As used herein, the term "feedstuff' refers to a feed material to which one or more feed additive compositions have been added. It will be understood by the skilled person that different animals require different feedstuffs, and even the same animal may require different feedstuffs, depending upon the purpose for which the animal is reared. Preferably, the feedstuff may comprise feed materials comprising maize or corn, wheat, barley, triticale, rye, rice, tapioca, sorghum, and/ or any of the by-products, as well as protein rich components like soybean mean, rape seed meal, canola meal, cotton seed meal, sunflower seed mean, animal-by-product meals and mixtures thereof. More preferably, the feedstuff may comprise animal fats and / or vegetable oils. Optionally, the feedstuff may also contain additional minerals such as, for example, calcium and/or additional vitamins. Preferably, the feedstuff is a corn soybean meal mix. In one embodiment, preferably the feed is not pet food. In another aspect there is provided a method for producing a feedstuff.  Feedstuff is typically produced in feed mills in which raw materials are first ground to a suitable particle size and then mixed with appropriate additives. The feedstuff may then be produced as a mash or pellets; the later typically involves a method by which the temperature is raised to a target level and then the feed is passed through a die to produce pellets of a particular size. The pellets are allowed to cool. Subsequently liquid additives such as fat and enzyme may be added. Production of feedstuff may also involve an additional step that includes extrusion or expansion prior to pelleting ¨ in particular by suitable techniques that may include at least the use of steam. The feedstuff may be a feedstuff for a monogastric animal, such as poultry (for example, broiler, layer, broiler breeders, turkey, duck, geese, water fowl), swine (all age categories), a pet (for example dogs, cats) or fish, preferably the feedstuff is for poultry. In one embodiment the feedstuff is not for a layer.

The feed additive composition of the present invention may be used in the form of solid or liquid preparations or alternatives thereof. Examples of solid preparations include powders, pastes, boluses, capsules, pellets, tablets, dusts, and granules which may be wettable, spray-dried or freeze-dried. Examples of liquid preparations include, but are not limited to, aqueous, organic or aqueous-organic solutions, suspensions and emulsions. In some applications, DFM or feed additive compositions of the present invention may be mixed with feed or administered in the drinking water. In one embodiment the dosage range for inclusion into water is about 1x10 CFU/animal/day to about 1x101 CFU/animal/day, and more preferably about 1x107 CFU/animal/day. Suitable examples of forms include one or more of: powders, pastes, boluses, pellets, tablets, pills, capsules, ovules, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or controlled-release applications. By way of example, if the composition of the present invention is used in a solid, e.g.  pelleted form, it may also contain one or more of: excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine;  disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates; granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulos.e (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.

Non-hydroscopic whey is often used as a carrier for DFMs (particularly bacterial DFMs) and is a good medium to initiate growth. Bacterial DFM containing pastes may be formulated with vegetable oil and inert gelling ingredients. 20    Fungal products may be formulated with grain by-products as carriers. In one embodiment preferably the feed additive composition according to the present invention is not in the form of a microparticle system, such as the microparticle system taught in W02005/123034. 25    Dosing The DFM and/or feed additive composition according to the present invention may be designed for one-time dosing or may be designed for feeding on a daily basis. The optimum amount of the composition (and each component therein) to be used in the combination of the present invention will depend on the product to be treated and/or the 30    method of contacting the product with the composition and/or the intended use for the same. The amount of DFM and enzyme(s) used in the compositions should be a sufficient amount to be effective and to remain sufficiently effective in improving the performance of the animal fed feed products containing said composition. This length of time for effectiveness should extend up to at least the time of utilisation of the 35    product (e.g. feed additive composition or feed containing same). The ratio of DFM to enzyme. in the feed can be in the ranges given below:     DFM:phytase (CFU/FTU): In range from 2.5x103CFU DFM: 1FTU enzyme to 6.7x106 CFU :1FTU enzyme; preferably in the range from 3.8x103CFU DFM: 1FTU enzyme to 2.0x105 CFU :1FTU enzyme.

In one embodiment preferably the feedstuff comprises the following:      a phytase at (at least) 3000FTU/kg of feed; and DFM at at least 5x104CFU/g to 1x107CFU/g of feed. In another embodiment the feedstuff comprises the following: In a preferred embodiment the feed additive composition comprises sufficient enzyme and DFMs to dose the feedstuff as follows: a phytase at (at least) 1500FTU/kg (e.g. at (at least) 2000FTU/kg) of feed;  and Envivo Pro (DFM) at 75,000 CFU/g to 150,000 CFU/g of feed. In a preferred embodiment the feed additive composition comprises sufficient enzyme and DFMs to dose the feedstuff as follows: a phytase at (at least) 1500FTU/kg (e.g. at (at least) 2000FTU/kg) of feed;  and Envivo Pro (DFM) at 37,500 CFU/g to 75,000 CFU/g of feed. Combination with Other Components The DFM and enzyme(s) for use in the present invention may be used in combination with other components. Thus, the present invention also relates to combinations.  The DFM in combination with a phytase may be referred to herein as "the feed additive composition of the present invention".     The combination of the present invention comprises the feed additive composition of the present invention (or one or more of the constituents thereof) and another component which is suitable for animal consumption and is capable of providing a medical or physiological benefit to the consumer. In one embodiment preferably the "another component" is not a further enzyme or a further DFM. The components may be prebiotics. Prebiotics are typically non-digestible carbohydrate ((Ago- or polysaccharides) or a sugar alcohol which is not degraded or absorbed in the upper digestive tract. Known prebiotics used in commercial products and useful in accordance with the present invention include inulin (fructo-oligosaccharide, or FOS) and transgalacto-oligosaccharides (GOS or TOS). Suitable prebiotics include palatinoseoligosaccharide, soybean oligosaccharide, alginate, xanthan, pectin, locust bean gum (LBG), inulin, guar gum, galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS), fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), non-degradable starch, lactosaccharose, lactulose, lactitol, maltitol, maltodextrin, polydextrose (i.e. Litesse0), lactitol, lactosucrose, soybean oligosaccharides, palatinose, isomalto-oligosaccharides, gluco-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides, pectin fragments, dietary fibres, mannan-oligosaccharides. Dietary fibres may include non-starch polysaccharides, such as arabinoxylans, cellulose and many other plant components, such as resistant dextrins, inulin, lignin, waxes, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans and oligosaccharides. In one embodiment the present invention relates to the combination of the feed additive composition according to the present invention (or one or more of the constituents thereof) with a prebiotic. In another embodiment the present invention relates to a feed additive composition comprising (or consisting essentially of or consisting of) a DFM  in combination with a high dosage of phytase, and a prebiotic. The prebiotic may be administered simultaneously with (e.g. in admixture together with or delivered simultaneously by the same or different routes) or sequentially to (e.g. by the same or different routes) the feed additive composition (or constituents thereof) according to the present invention. Other components of the combinations of the present invention include polydextrose, such as Litesse0, and/or a maltodextrin and/or lactitol. These other components may be optionally added to the feed additive composition to assist the drying process and help the survival of DFM. Further examples of other suitable components include one or more of:  thickeners, gelling agents, emulsifiers, binders, crystal modifiers, sweeteners (including artificial sweeteners), rheology modifiers, stabilisers, anti-oxidants, dyes, enzymes, carriers, vehicles, excipients, diluents, lubricating agents, flavouring agents, colouring matter, suspending agents, disintegrants, granulation binders etc. These other components may be natural.  These other components may be prepared by use of chemical and/or enzymatic techniques.  In one preferred embodiment the DFM and/or enzyme for use in the present invention may be used in combination with one or more lipids. For example, the DFM and/or enzyme for use in the present invention may be used in combination with one or more lipid micelles. The lipid micelle may be a simple lipid micelle or a complex lipid micelle. The lipid micelle may be an aggregate of orientated molecules of amphipathic substances, such as a lipid and/or an oil. As used herein the term "thickener or gelling agent" refers to a product that prevents separation by slowing or preventing the movement of particles, either droplets of immiscible liquids, air or insoluble solids. Thickening occurs when individual hydrated molecules cause an increase in viscosity, slowing the separation. Gelation occurs when the hydrated molecules link to form a three-dimensional network that traps the particles, thereby immobilising them. The term "stabiliser" as used here is defined as an ingredient or combination of ingredients that keeps a product (e.g. a feed product) from changing over time. The term "emulsifier" as used herein refers to an ingredient (e.g. a feed ingredient) that prevents the separation of emulsions. Emulsions are two immiscible substances, one present in droplet form, contained within the other. Emulsions can consist of oil-in-water, where the droplet or dispersed phase is oil and the continuous phase is water;  or water-in-oil, where the water becomes the dispersed phase and the continuous phase is oil. Foams, which are gas-in-liquid, and suspensions, which are solid-in-liquid, can also be stabilised through the use of emulsifiers. As used herein the term "binder" refers to an ingredient (e.g. a feed ingredient) that binds the product together through a physical or chemical reaction. During "gelation"  for instance, water is absorbed, providing a binding effect. However, binders can absorb other liquids, such as oils, holding them within the product. In the context of the present invention binders would typically be used in solid or low-moisture products for instance baking products: pastries, doughnuts, bread and others. "Carriers" or "vehicles" mean materials suitable for administration of the DFM  and/or enzymes and include any such material known in the art such as, for example, any liquid, gel, solvent, liquid diluent, solubilizer, or the like, which is non-toxic and which does not interact with any components of the composition in a deleterious manner. The present invention provides a method for preparing a feed additive composition comprising admixing a DFM, and a phytase with at least one physiologically acceptable carrier selected from at least one of maltodextrin, limestone (calcium carbonate), cyclodextrin, wheat or a wheat component, sucrose, starch, Na2SO4, Talc, PVA, sorbitol, benzoate, sorbiate, glycerol, sucrose, propylene glycol, 1,3-propane diol, glucose, parabens, sodium chloride, citrate, acetate, phosphate, calcium, metabisulfite, formate and mixtures thereof. Examples of exciplents include one or more of: microcrystalline cellulose and other celluloses, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate, glycine, starch, milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. Examples of disintegrants include one or more of: starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates. Examples of granulation binders include one or more of: polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (H PC), sucrose, maltose, gelatin and acacia. Examples of lubricating agents include one or more of: magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc. Examples of diluents include one or more of: water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof. The other components may be used simultaneously (e.g. when they are in admixture together or even when they are delivered by different routes) or sequentially (e.g. they may be delivered by different routes), Preferably, when the feed additive composition of the present invention is admixed with another component(s), the DFM remains viable. In one embodiment preferably the feed additive composition according to the present invention does not comprise chromium or organic chromium Concentrates The DFMs for use in the present invention may be in the form of concentrates.  Typically these concentrates comprise a substantially high concentration of a DFM. Feed additive compositions according to the present invention may have a content of viable cells (colony forming units, CFUs) which is in the range of at least 104 CFU/g (suitably including at least 105 CFU/g, such as at least 106 CFU/g, e.g. at least 107 CFU/g, at least 108 CFU/g) to about 1010 CFU/g (or even about 1011 CFU/g or about 1012 CFU/g). When the DFM is in the form of a concentrate the feed additive compositions according to the present invention may have a content of viable cells in the range of at least 109 CFU/g to about 1012 CFU/g, preferably at least 1010 CFU/g to about 1012 CFU/g. Powders, granules and liquid compositions in the form of concentrates may be diluted with water or resuspended in water or other suitable diluents, for example, an appropriate growth medium such as milk or mineral or vegetable oils, to give compositions ready for use.     The DFM or feed additive composition of the present invention or the combinations of the present invention in the form of concentrates may be prepared according to methods known in the art. In one aspect of the present invention the enzymes or feed is contacted by a composition in 5    a concentrated form. The compositions of the present invention may be spray-dried or freeze-dried by methods known in the art. Typical processes for making particles using a spray drying process involve a solid material which is dissolved in an appropriate solvent (e.g. a culture of a DFM in a fermentation 10    medium). Alternatively, the material can be suspended or emulsified in a non-solvent to form a suspension or emulsion. Other ingredients (as discussed above) or components such as anti-microbial agents, stabilising agents, dyes and agents assisting with the drying process may optionally be added at this stage. The solution then is atomised to form a fine mist of droplets. The droplets immediately enter 15    a drying chamber where they contact a drying gas. The solvent is evaporated from the droplets into the drying gas to solidify the droplets, thereby forming particles. The particles are then separated from the drying gas and collected. Subject 20    The term "subject", as used herein, means an animal that is to be or has been administered with a feed additive composition according to the present invention or a feedstuff comprising said feed additive composition according to the present invention. The term "subject", as used herein, means an animal. In one embodiment, the subject is a mammal, bird, fish or crustacean including for example 25    livestock or a domesticated animal (e.g. a pet). In one embodiment the "subject" is livestock. The term "livestock", as used herein refers to any farmed animal. Preferably, livestock is one or more of ruminants such as cattle (e.g. cows or bulls (including calves)), mono-gastric animals such as poultry (including broilers, chickens and turkeys), pigs (including piglets), 30    birds, aquatic animals such as fish, agastric fish, gastric fish, freshwater fish such as salmon, cod, trout and carp, e.g. koi carp, marine fish such as sea bass, and crustaceans such as shrimps, mussels and scallops), horses (including race horses), sheep (including lambs).  In another embodiment the "subject" is a domesticated animal or pet or an animal maintained in a zoological environment. 35    The term "domesticated animal or pet or animal maintained in a zoological environment" as used herein refers to any relevant animal including canines (e.g. dogs), felines (e.g. cats), rodents (e.g. guinea pigs, rats, mice), birds, fish (including freshwater fish and marine fish), and horses. In one embodiment the subject may be challenged by an enteric pathogen. By way of example a subject may have one or more enteric pathogens present in its gut or digestive tract. For example a subject may have one or more enteric pathogens in its gut or digestive tract at a level which: i)    results in loss of performance of the animal and/or ii) is at clinically relevant levels; or iii) is at sub-clinical levels.      The enteric pathogen may be Clostridium perfringens for example. Performance As used herein, 'animal performance" may be determined by the feed efficiency and/or weight gain of the animal and/or by the feed conversion ratio and/or by the digestibility of a nutrient in a feed (e.g. amino acid digestibility) and/or digestible energy or metabolizable energy in a feed and/or by nitrogen retention and/or by animals ability to avoid the negative effects of necrotic enteritis and/or by the immune response of the subject. Preferably "animal performance" is determined by feed efficiency and/or weight gain of the animal and/or by the feed conversion ratio. By "improved animal performance" it is meant that there is increased feed efficiency, and/or increased weight gain and/or reduced feed conversion ratio and/or improved digestibility of nutrients or energy in a feed and/or by improved nitrogen retention and/or by improved ability to avoid the negative effects of necrotic enteritis and/or by an improved immune response in the subject resulting from the use of feed additive composition of the present invention in feed in comparison to feed which does not comprise said feed additive composition. Preferably, by "improved animal performance" it is meant that there is increased feed efficiency and/or increased weight gain and/or reduced feed conversion ratio. As used herein, the term "feed efficiency" refers to the amount of weight gain in an animal that occurs when the animal is fed ad-libitum or a specified amount of food during a period of time. By "increased feed efficiency" it is meant that the use of a feed additive composition according the present invention in feed results in an increased weight gain per unit of feed intake compared with an animal fed without said feed additive composition being present.      Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) As used herein, the term "feed conversion ratio" refers to the amount of feed fed to an animal to increase the weight of the animal by a specified amount.     An improved feed conversion ratio means a lower feed conversion ratio. By "lower feed conversion ratio" or "improved feed conversion ratio" it is meant that the use of a feed additive composition in feed results in a lower amount of feed being required to be fed to an animal to increase the weight of the animal by a specified amount compared to the amount of feed required to increase the weight of the animal by the same amount when the feed does not comprise said feed additive composition. Nutrient digestibility Nutrient digestibility as used herein means the fraction of a nutrient that disappears from the gastro-intestinal tract or a specified segment of the gastro-intestinal tract, e.g. the small intestine. Nutrient digestibility may be measured as the difference between what is administered to the subject and what comes out in the faeces of the subject, or between what is administered to the subject and what remains in the digesta on a specified segment of the gastro intestinal tract, e.g. the ileum. Nutrient digestibility as used herein may be measured by the difference between the intake of a nutrient and the excreted nutrient by means of the total collection of excreta during a period of time; or with the use of an inert marker that is not absorbed by the animal, and allows the researcher calculating the amount of nutrient that disappeared in the entire gastro-intestinal tract or a segment of the gastro-intestinal tract. Such an inert marker may be titanium dioxide, chromic oxide or acid insoluble ash. Digestibility may be expressed as a percentage of the nutrient in the feed, or as mass units of digestible nutrient per mass units of nutrient in the feed. Nutrient digestibility as used herein encompasses starch digestibility, fat digestibility, protein digestibility, and amino acid digestibility. Energy digestibility as used herein means the gross energy of the feed consumed minus the gross energy of the faeces or the gross energy of the feed consumed minus the gross energy of the remaining digesta on a specified segment of the gastro-intestinal tract of the animal, e.g. the ileum. Metabolizable energy as used herein refers to apparent metabolizable energy and means the gross energy of the feed consumed minus the gross energy contained in the faeces, urine, and gaseous products of digestion. Energy digestibility and metabolizable energy may be measured as the difference between the intake of gross energy and the gross energy excreted in the faeces or the digesta present in specified = segment of the gastro-intestinal tract using the same methods to measure the digestibility of nutrients, with appropriate corrections for nitrogen excretion to calculate metabolizable energy of feed. Nitrogen retention .    Nitrogen retention as used herein means as subject's ability to retain nitrogen from the diet as body mass. A negative nitrogen balance occurs when the excretion of nitrogen exceeds the daily intake and is often seen when the muscle is being lost. A positive nitrogen balance is often associated with muscle growth, particularly in growing animals. Nitrogen retention may be measured as the difference between the intake of nitrogen and the excreted nitrogen by means of the total collection of excreta and urine during a period of time. It is understood that excreted nitrogen includes undigested protein from the feed, endogenous proteinaceous secretions, microbial protein, and urinary nitrogen, Survival The term survival as used herein means the number of subject remaining alive.  The term "improved survival" may be another way of saying "reduced mortality". Carcass yield and meat yield The term carcass yield as used herein means the amount of carcass as a proportion of the live body weight, after a commercial or experimental process of slaughter. The term carcass means the body of an animal that has been slaughtered for food, with the head, entrails, part of the limbs, and feathers or skin removed. The term meat yield as used herein means the amount of edible meat as a proportion of the live body weight, or the amount of a specified meat cut as a proportion of the live body weight. Weight gain The present invention further provides a method of increasing weight gain in a subject, e.g. poultry or swine, comprising feeding said subject a feedstuff comprising a feed additive composition according to the present invention. An "increased weight gain" refers to an animal having increased body weight on being fed feed comprising a feed additive composition compared with an animal being fed a feed without said feed additive composition being present. The increase in weight gain may be at least 0.5%, at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 3%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 12%, at least 15%, at least 20% or at least 30%. In some embodiments the improvement may be at least 50% or at least 100%. The increase in weight gain may be in respect to a control in which the feed used does not comprise a DFM and high dosage (i.e. >1500FTU/kg feed) phytase. In another aspect the increase in weight gain may be with respect to the use of a feed comprising another phytase wherein the phytase is used in a low dose e.g. <1000FTU/kg feed.     Clinical or subclinical intestinal disease challenge In one embodiment a clinical or subclinical intestinal disease challenge is present in the subject In one embodiment the clinical or subclinical intestinal disease challenge may be caused by any pathogen or any pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens or E.co/i. The term "clinical disease" means  a stage in the history of a pathologic condition that begins with anatomic or physiologic changes that are sufficient to produce recognizable signs and symptoms of a disease. The term "subclinical disease" means or relates to a stage in the course of a disease before the symptoms are fist noted. The intestinal disease may be any intestinal infection which the subject can suffer from. In one example the intestinal disease may be caused by pathogenic organisms, such as pathogenic bacteria. In one embodiment the intestinal disease may be caused by one or more of the following organisms: pathogenic Clostridium spp, such as Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, and/or E coil and/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp. In one embodiment the intestinal disease may be caused by one or more of the following pathogens: Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile and/or E.  coil, preferably Clostridium perfringens and/or Clostridium difficile, more preferably Clostridium perfringens.    Necrotic enteritis Necrotic enteritis is an acute or chronic enterotoxemia seen in chickens, turkeys and ducks worldwide, caused by Clostridium perfringens. Necrotic enteritis is often characterised by a fibrino-necrotic enteritis, usually of the mid- small intestine. Mortality may be 5-50%, usually around 10%. Infection occurs by faecal-oral transmission. Spores of the causative organism are highly resistant. Predisposing factors include coccidiosis/coccidiasis, diet (high protein), in ducks possibly heavy strains, high viscosity diets (often associated with high rye and wheat inclusions in the diet), contaminated feed and/or water, other debilitating diseases. The present invention relates to increasing the subject's resistance to necrotic enteritis. In other words, the present invention relates to avoiding or reducing the negative effect of necrotic enteritis. The term "resistance to" as used herein may encompasses the term "tolerance of".  Therefore in one embodiment the subject may not be resistant to necrotic enteritis but the subject may be able to tolerate the necrotic enteritis, i.e. without negative effects on performance of the subject. In one embodiment the present invention relates to a feed additive composition according to the present invention for treating or preventing necrotic enteritis in a subject. Typically the subject will be one which has been or will be challenged with Clostridium petfringens and/or Eimeria species. Such challenge may come from the environment or the application of live microorganisms in the feed or drinking water, e.g. when live coccidia vaccines are used.  In another embodiment the present invention relates to a feed additive composition for 5    preventing and/or treating coccidiosis in a subject. The present invention yet further provides a method of preventing and/or treating necrotic enteritis and/or coccidiosis wherein an effective amount of a feed additive composition according to the present invention is administered to a subject. 10    Immune response Immune response as used herein means one of the multiple ways in which DFMs modulate the immune system of animals, including increased antibody production, up-regulation of cell mediated immunity, up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and augmented toll-like receptor signalling. It is understood that immuno-stimulation of the gastro intestinal tract by 15    DFMs may be advantageous to protect the host against disease, and that immuno-suppression of the gastro intestinal tract may be advantageous to the host because less nutrients and energy are used to support the immune function. Preferably the immune response is a cellular immune response. Preferably immune response is measure by looking at immune markers.    Pathogenic bacteria The term pathogenic bacteria as used herein means for example toxigenic clostridia species, e.g. Clostridium perfringens and/or E. coil and/or Salmonella spp and/or Campylobacter spp. In one embodiment the pathogenic bacteria may be Avian pathogenic E. coil species. The present invention may reduce populations of pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject. Nutrient Excretion In one embodiment the present invention relates to reducing nutrient excretion in manure. This has positive effects on reducing environmental hazards. For example, in a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to reducing nitrogen and/or phosphorus content in the subject's manure. This, therefore, reduces the amount of nitrogen and/or phosphorus in the environment, which can be beneficial.     Probiotic For some applications, it is believed that the DFM in the composition of the present invention can exert a probiotic culture effect. It is also within the scope of the present invention to add to the composition of the present invention further probiotic and/or prebiotics.      Here, a prebiotic is: "a non-digestible food ingredient that beneficially affects the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or the activity of one or a limited number of beneficial bacteria". The term "probiotic culture" as used herein defines live microorganisms (including bacteria or yeasts for example) which, when for example ingested or locally applied in sufficient numbers, beneficially affects the host organism, i.e. by conferring one or more demonstrable health benefits on the host organism. Probiotics may improve the microbial balance in one or more mucosal surfaces. For example, the mucosal surface may be the intestine, the urinary tract, the respiratory tract or the skin. The term "probiotic" as used herein also encompasses live microorganisms that can stimulate the beneficial branches of the immune system and at the same time decrease the inflammatory reactions in a mucosal surface, for example the gut. Whilst there are no lower or upper limits for probiotic intake, it has been suggested that at least 106-1012, preferably at least 106-10'0, preferably 106-109, cfu as a daily dose will be effective to achieve the beneficial health effects in a subject.    Isolated In one aspect, suitably the enzyme or DFM used in the present invention may be in an isolated form. The term "isolated" means that the enzyme or DFM is at least substantially free from at least one other component with which the enzyme or DFM is naturally associated in nature and as found in nature. The enzyme or DFM of the present invention may be provided in a form that is substantially free of one or more contaminants with which the substance might otherwise be associated. Thus, for example it may be substantially free of one or more potentially contaminating polypeptides and/or nucleic acid molecules.      Purified In one aspect, preferably the enzyme and/or DFM according to the present invention is in a purified form. The term "purified" means that the enzyme and/or DFM is present at a high level. The enzyme and/or DFM is desirably, the predominant component present in a composition. Preferably, it is present at a level of at least about 90%, or at least about 95% or at least about 98%, said level being determined on a dry weight/dry weight basis with respect to the total composition under consideration.     It is envisaged within the scope of the present invention that the embodiments of the invention can be combined such that combinations of any of the features described herein are included within the scope of the present invention. In particular, it is envisaged within the scope of the present invention that any of the therapeutic effects of the bacteria may be exhibited concomitantly. The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the following Figures and Examples. EXAMPLES    EXAMPLE Methods A total of 1600 one-day-old Cobb male chicks are purchased from a commercial hatchery. At study initiation, fifty males are allocated to each treatment pen by blocks.  The study consists of the following treatments (Table 1): Table 1. Experimental design of Example 1.

Bird weights by pen are recorded at study initiation, 23 d, 35 d, and termination (42d). The pen is the unit of measure. Broiler diets are fed as crumbles (starter) or pellets (grower and finisher). Diets met or exceeded NRC standards (Table 2). The mixer is flushed to prevent cross contamination of diets. All treatment feeds are mixed using a Davis S-20 mixer and pelleted using a California Pellet Mill (cold pellet temperature 65-70 C).  Samples are collected from each treatment diet from the beginning, middle, and end of each batch and blended together to confirm enzyme activities and Enviva Pro presence in feed.   Table 2.

Enzymes and Enviva Pro are provided by Danisco in the appropriate mixtures and levels for all experimental treatments. The pens are arranged within the facility to prevent direct contact in order to avoid contamination. A change from starter to grower occurred on day 23. Grower diet is replaced with the finisher diet on day 35. At each feed change, feeders are removed from pens by block, weighed back, emptied, and refilled with the appropriate treatment diet. On the final day of the study feed is weighed. Pens are checked daily for mortality. When a bird is culled or found dead, the date and removal weight (kg) are recorded. A  gross necropsy is performed on all dead or culled birds to determine the sex and probable cause of death. Signs of Necrotic Enteritis are noted. All pens had approximately 4 inches of built up litter with a coating of fresh pine shavings. All birds are spray vaccinated prior to placement into pens with a commercial coccidiosis vaccine (Coccivac-B). On days 20, 21 and 22 all birds, except Treatment 1, are dosed with a broth culture of C. perfringens. A field isolate of C. perfringens known to cause NE and originating from a commercial broiler operation is utilized as the challenge organism. Fresh inoculum is used each day. The titration levels are approximately 1.0 X 108-9.  Each pen receives the same amount of inoculum. The inoculum is administered by mixing into the feed found in the base of the tube feeder. On day 23, five birds from each pen are selected, euthanized, group weighed, and examined for the degree of presence of Necrotic Enteritis lesions. The scoring was based on a 0 to 3 score, with 0 being normal and 3 being the most severe (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked/severe; Hofacre et at., 2003 J. App!. Poult. Res. 12:60-64). No concomitant drug therapy is used during the study. Means are separated using pair wise t-tests. Significant differences are considered at P<0.05. Pens are used as the experimental unit.    Results Body weight gain is significantly reduced by the C. perfringens challenge as shown from d23 until the end of the trial (Figure 1). Supplementation with Enviva Pro significantly improves body weight gain to the level of the positive control on each of the sample days. However further supplementation with a high phytase dose (treatment 10) improved body weight to a level significantly greater than the positive control at days 12, 23 and 35 and a numerically greater level at d42. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) is significantly increased by the C. perfringens challenge as shown form d 23 until the end of the trial (Figure 2). Addition of Enviva Pro to the diet lead to a significant reduction in FCR from the negative control. However, supplementation with the high phytase dose reduces the FCR to a level the same as found in the positive control. There is a reduction in mortality observed with the supplementation of Enviva Pro (Figure 3), which is further numerically reduced with the supplementation of the high phytase dose. This can be accounted for by a reduction in the severity of the C. perfringens challenge, supported by the numerically reduced lesion scores found when the high phytase dose is supplemented (Figure 4), which was not significantly different from the lesion scores of the positive control. 5    There is a clear benefit of utilising a high phytase dose (3000 FTU/kg) in combination with Enviva Pro, demonstrated with reduced FCR and increased body weight gain compared to using Enviva Pro with a standard (500FTU) dose of phytase. These benefits are accounted for by reduced intestinal damage.   Materials and methods A total of 1040 one-day-old Cobb x Cobb 500 male chicks are purchased from a commercial hatchery. At study initiation, ten males are randomly allocated to Petersime battery cages 15    according to the respective treatments by blocks. Only healthy birds are selected for the experiment, and no birds are replaced throughout the course of the study. The study consists of the following treatments (Table 1): Table 1.

At the feed change, feeders are removed from pens, weighed back, emptied, and refilled with the appropriate treatment diet. On the final day of the study, feed is weighed. Pens are checked daily for mortality. When a bird is culled or found dead, the date and removal weight (kg) are recorded. A gross necropsy is performed on all dead or culled birds to determine the probable cause of death. Signs of Necrotic Enteritis are recorded. Ad-libitum feed of the appropriate treatment is available for the birds throughout the duration of the study. Disease induction is according to the research site standard operating procedure (SOP).  Briefly; on day 13, all birds are orally inoculated with Eimeria maxima, with inocula containing approximately 5,000 oocysts per bird. On day 18, all birds apart from treatments 1 and 3, receive a broth culture of Clostridium perfringens containing approximately 108 cfu/ml. All treated pens receive the same amount of inocula. Fresh C. perfringens inoculum is administered once daily for three days (days 18, 19 and 20) by mixing into the feed in the base of the feeders. On day 21, three birds from each pen are selected, euthanized, group weighed, and examined for the degree of presence of Necrotic Enteritis lesions. The scoring is based on a 0 to 3 score, with 0 being normal and 3 being the most severe (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked/severe; Hofacre et al., 2003 J. Appl. Poult.  Res. 12:60-64). No concomitant drug therapy is used during the study. For performance data, the effects of treatment are tested using ANOVA, and means are separated using pair wise t-tests using JMP software. Significant differences are considered at P<0.05. Cages are used as the experimental unit. For pH and organ weight data, each bird is an experimental unit. In order to test interactions, a subset of treatments (treatments 4 to 13) are analysed with ANOVA using a factorial arrangement that included the main effects of phytase and Enviva Pro, as well as their interaction. Results The C. perfringens challenge significantly reduce bird performance in terms of both body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), at both d 21 and d 28, compared to the unchallenged control (Ti vs. T2, 13 vs. T4) (Table 3). The reduction in dietary P has no effect on BWG at either d 21 or d 28 in the absence of the C. perfringens challenge. There is however, a noticeable numerical reduction in BWG between the high and low P  diets in the presence of the C. perfringens challenge. These observations are consistent with the data for FCR. When phytase is supplemented alone, there are variable effects on bird performance;  however, in all cases, there is a numerical improvement in day 21 BWG to a level higher than that of the challenged low P diet (T4). Results obtained indicate that high phytase doses do not further improve bird performance in the conditions of a Necrotic Enteritis challenge; as the lowest BWG of the phytase only treatments is found at the 10,000 FTU  dose of phytase (T8), which is not significantly different than the challenged low P diet (T4).  Likewise, at day 28, when phytase is supplemented alone there is a numerical reduction in BWG at phytase levels greater than 1500 FTU. When Enviva Pro is supplemented alone (T9) there is a significant improvement in BWG at day 21 from the challenged low P diet (T4) and a further improvement to a level not significantly different to the unchallenged low P diet by day 28. In terms of FCR, there is a significant reduction from the challenged control with Enviva Pro supplementation, but not enough to completely counteract the negative effects of the challenge. In combination, high doses of Phytase and Enviva Pro result in a more uniform response in terms of BWG, compared to when Phytase is supplemented alone, at both day 21 and day 28. In terms of FOR, there is a synergistic effect of the combination at day 21 (Figure 5).  When phytase is supplemented alone, there is an increase in performance (reduction in FCR) at the 500, 1500 (T7) and 3000FTU/kg levels and a reduction in performance when phytase dose is exceeded in the conditions of a Necrotic Enteritis challenge.  However, when the probiotic is added in combination, there consistently is a numerical reduction in the FCR compared to the phytase only treatments up to and including the level of (T12). However at 10,000 FTU (T13), there is a large significant reduction which results in the lowest FOR of all of the treatment groups. When specifically investigating the effects of the combination (i.e. excluding positive controls T1, 12 and T3) there is a significant effect of the combination on day 21 FOR (P=0.0319) (Table 4). The reduction in dietary AvP causes significant reductions in tibia ash (Table 3), which is an indicator of phosphorus bioavailability. The C. perfringens challenge results in small numerical reductions in tibia ash content, which is likely due to the intestinal damage caused by the infection reducing the ability of the gut to absorb nutrients efficiently. Supplementation with phytase alone results in restoration of the tibia ash % to a level not significantly different to the unchallenged high P diet (Ti). When Enviva Pro is supplemented alone (T9), there is a numerical increase in tibia ash % to a level greater than the unchallenged low P diet (T3), which demonstrates the ability of the product to counter the effects of the C.  perfringens challenge in terms of reductions in tibia ash, which could suggest restoration of gut function.  When the combination was supplemented, there is a dose response to phytase reaching a level greater than the unchallenged high P diet (T1) at 3000FTU, such an improvement is not observed when phytase was supplemented alone Table 3.

The lack of mortality and absence of lesion scores in the unchallenged groups indicates there is no contarnination between challenged and unchallenged groups. There is no significant difference between the Phytase and EnvivaPro Phytase at any level of phytase in terms of lesions scores (T4-8 vs. T9-13). However, there is a numerical increase in mortality above the level of the challenged low P diet in the Phytase only treatments for the 1500 (16) and 3000FTU (T7) treatments. The addition of EnvivaPro leads to a significant reduction in mortality from the challenged low P diet and also reduced the variation in mortality rates between the phytase doses in combination compared to the Phytase only treatments.

The pen is the unit of measure. Diets are formulated to meet NRC  guidelines (Table 2).  All treatment feeds are mixed using a Davis S-20 mixer. The mixer is flushed between diets to prevent cross contamination of diets. Samples are collected from each treatment diet form the beginning, middle and end of each batch, pooled, and analysed to confirm enzyme activity and DFM presence in feed. Diets are fed in mash form. All pens have approximately 4 inches of built up litter with a coating of fresh pine shavings. All birds receive a commercial coccidiosis vaccine orally prior to placement into pens.

From day 7 grower diets appropriate to the treatment are fed until day 21. Finisher diets appropriate to treatment are fed from day 21 to study termination (day 35). At the feed change, feeders are removed from pens, weighed back, emptied, and refilled with the appropriate treatment diet.  On the final day of the study, feed is weighed. Pens are checked daily for mortality. When a bird is culled or found dead, the date and removal weight (kg) are recorded. For performance data, means are separated using pair wise t-tests. Significant differences are considered at P<0.05. Pens are used as the experimental unit. Results Increasing the dose of phytase alone causes no significant improvement in feed conversion ratio (FCR) at 35 days of age (Figure 6). The addition of Enviva Pro at all levels of phytase reduces FCR. As phytase dose increases so does the benefit from adding Enviva Pro. The highest level of phytase inclusion creates the largest difference in FCR  between the diets With and without Enviva Pro.

At the feed change, feeders are removed from cages, weighed back, emptied, and refilled with the appropriate treatment diet. On the final day of the study, feed is weighed. Cages are checked daily for mortality. When a bird is culled or found dead, the date and removal weight (kg) are recorded. A gross necropsy is performed on all dead or culled birds to determine the probable cause of death. Signs of Necrotic Enteritis are recorded. Ad-libitum feed of the appropriate treatment is available for the birds throughout the duration of the study. Disease induction is according to the research site standard operating procedure (SOP).  Briefly; on day 13, all birds we orally inoculate with Eimeria maxima, with inocula containing approximately 5,000 oocysts per bird. On day 18, all birds apart from treatments 1 and 3, receive a broth culture of Clostridium perfringens containing approximately 108cfu/ml. All treated pens receive the same amount of inocula. Fresh C. petfringens inoculum is administered once daily for three days (days 18, 19 and 20) by mixing into the feed in the base of the feeders. On day 21, three birds from each pen are selected, euthanized, group weighed, and examined for the degree of presence of Necrotic Enteritis lesions. The scoring is based on a 0 to 3 score, with 0 being normal and 3 being the most severe (0 = none, 1 =  mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked/severe; Hofacre et al., 2003 J. Appl. PouIt.  Res. 12:60-64).  No concomitant drug therapy is used during the study. The pH of ileal digesta of 2 birds per cage is measured on day 21. The pH of the digesta is determined by inserting a Sensorex spear tip piercing pH probe into the respective sections. In both birds, the gizzard are also removed and weighed. On day 21, the right tibias of the two birds are removed, dried overnight at 100 C and weighed; samples are then fat-extracted and burned in a muffle furnace at 600C for 16 hours to determine the fat free bone ash. The percentage bone ash is then calculated as the ratio of remaining ash weight to the dry-fat free bone weight multiplied by 100. Statistical analysis For performance data, means are separated using pair wise t-tests. Significant differences are considered at P<0.05. Cages are used as the experimental unit.      Results: Increasing the dose of Hi Phos causes an increase in feed conversion ratio at 21days of age (Figure 7; more feed per unit of body weight gain) in a Necrotic Enteritis challenge situation.  The addition of Enviva Pro at all levels of inclusion of phytase cause a decrease, improving FCR. At the highest level of phytase inclusion (3000FTU/kg) the increase in FCR seen over the 1500FTU/kg dose is increasingly attenuated by the addition of Enviva Pro.

The effect of phytase on tibia ash percentage is not significantly different to the negative challenged control, suggesting that phytase does not have a significant effect on tibia ash under challenge situations, even at high doses (Figure 8). The addition of Enviva Pro however acts to significantly improve tibia ash percentage to bring it close to that seen in the positive unchallenged control at the highest dose of phytase (3000FTU/kg) as seen in Table 4.
