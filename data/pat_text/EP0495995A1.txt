 Background Art 
 
   
    
    [0002]
     It is known that a complement component C3, hereinafter referred to as "C3", is a protein that plays a crucial role in the complemental pathway. C3, however, is degraded by proteinases present in blood, and thus C3 is first cleaved with C3 convertase to produce C3a and C3b. This C3b is bonded to an extraneous substance through a thiol ester site thereof, following by an activation of the complemental pathway, to thereby form a membrane attack complex. C3a, acts as an anaphylatoxin C3b is then cleaved with a proteinase to finally produce C3dg or C3d. 
     
    
    [0003]
     Phospholipase A₂ is an enzyme which hydrolyze a bond of a phospholipid to produce a fatty acid and lysophospholipid. In particular, since the enzyme releases arachidonic acid, which can be a precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and the like, from a membrane phospholipid, it is believed that the enzyme can play an important role in producing such an inflammation mediator. Recently, a phospholipase A₂ was purified from the inflammatory sites in humans and some animals with inflammatory diseases, and characterized. It is believed that phospholipase A₂ accelerates the inflammatory reaction, and therefore, it is expected that drugs having a phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activity acts as an antiphlogistic. 
     
    
    [0004]
     The present inventors have carried out research on phospholipase A₂, and have screened proteins that specifically inhibit activity of phospholiase A₂. As a result, the inventors found that a C3dg originated from human and rats has a specific inhibitory activity on phospholipase A₂ from inflammatory sites, i.e., C3dg inhibits the phospholipase A₂ in the inflammatory sites and can act as an anti-inflammatory drug, and thus, Japanese Patent Application No. 1-200246 and 2-89085 corresponding to WO 91/01999 published after the filing date of Japanese Patent Application No. 2-205164, which claimed, a priority in the present application, were filed by the inventors at the Japanese Patent Office. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Nevertheless, great quantity of the purified C3dg must be obtained in order to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of C3dg. If methods of obtaining C3dg, there is known only a method whereby a serum is treated at a temperature of 37°C or C3 is treated with a proteinase, such as Factor I, and the like, and the resulting C3dg then isolated with various HPLC (see, Japanese Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2(1991)-91100). This method however, is not suitable for the aforementioned purposes, since the quantity of available C3dg is very limited. 
     
    
    [0006]
     To accomplish their purpose, the inventors carried out intensive research, and as a result, found a method of producing a great quantity of a protein comprising rat and human C3dg and having an inhibitory activity as high as that of the C3dg, to thereby complete this invention. 
     
    
    [0007]
     As described above, since the protein in accordance with the present invention specifically inhibits phospholipase A₂ at inflammatory sites, the protein is of interest as a preventive and remedial drug for particular diseases. Nevertheless, there is still a need for a more efficacious drug for allergies such as asthma, measles, or the like, which have recently become more wide spread. 
     
    
    [0008]
     It is known that allergic reactions can be classified into two types, i.e., the immediate type and the delayed type, and mast cells are a cause of an immediate allergic reaction. This is because mast cells have an IgE receptor having a high affinity in the surface of the cell membrane, release granule content such as a histamine, serotonin, and the like, by an antigenic sensitization (degranulation). Accordingly, a drug that inhibits an activation of the mast cells can be expected to have an improved efficacy with regard to allergies such as asthma and measles, etc., Also, the inventors have conducted research into an inhibitory protein for phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites and surprisingly, found that the inhibitory protein for phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites inhibits the degranulation of the mast cells, and thus another aspect of the present invention was completed.

The additional DNA sequences include those generally associated with the desired sequence during a cloning of the same. Namely, for example, the DNA sequences in accordance with the present invention include any DNA sequence containing rat or human C3dg and prepared by the construction steps illustrates in Figure 1 and 3, in part thereof. For example, such DNA sequences include the following DNA sequences: a DNA sequence reconstructed by a ligation of a 2.1 kbp of a DNA fragment derived from rat liver cDNA λgtll libraries with a double stranded DNA, wherein the DNA fragment is reconstructed by using a 2.0 kbp of DNA fragment prepared by a digestion of the cDNA λgtll library using EcoRI, and a 0.1 kbp of DNA fragment prepared by a digestion of another 0.7 kbp of DNA fragment from the cDNA λgtll library using EcoRI, and the double stranded DNA is the 2.1 kbp of DNA fragment digested by EcoRI and FokI to form a 1.0 kbp of EcoRI - FokI fragment wherein, upstream of the EcoRI-FokI fragment, is added an initiation codon and a 5' terminal of about 60bp of rat C3dg gene, and then to the resulting DNA sequence is added a termination codon and a 3' terminal of about 20 bp of rat C3dg gene downstream thereof, as well as a reconstructed DNA sequence prepared by a ligation of an initiation codon and a 5' terminal of about 70 bp of human C3dg gene upstream of about 1.2 kb of EcoRI-KpnI fragment, which is a digested from human cDNA clone pHLC3.11 using EcoRI and KpnI followed by a ligation of a double-stranded DNA of an EcoT14I-KpnI fragment prepared by an addition of a 3' terminal of about 80 bp of a human C3dg gene and a termination codon downstream of about 0.97 kb of an NcoI - EcoT14I fragment prepared by a partial digestion of the double-stranded DNA of the NcoI-EcoRI fragment, using EcoT14I. Namely, a DNA sequence encoding the inhibitory protein for phospholipase A₂ (hereinafter referred to as "PLA₂") originated from inflammatory sites and utilized for the construction of the plasmid in accordance with the present invention, is conceptually described below:
       (i) Init-PLA₂·DNA-Term;   (ii) Init-Signal·DNA-PLA₂·DNA-Term;   (iii)Init-a·DNA-b·DNA-PLA₂·DNA-term; and   (iv) Init-Signal·DNA-a·DNA-b·DNA-PLA₂·DNA-Term.    wherein Init represents an initiation codon, PLA₂·DNA represents a DNA sequence encoding a PLA₂ inhibitory protein, Term represents a termination codon, Signal·DNA represents a DNA sequence encoding a signal peptide, a·DNA represents a DNA encoding an additional polypeptide to abundantly express the PLA₂ inhibitory protein in a host cell, and b·DNA represents a DNA sequence encoding a cleavable sequence of a peptide. Note, the above-mentioned terms are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
       
    
    [0014]
     In the present invention, a DNA sequence having a promoter function includes a lactose-operon (lac) promoter and variant thereof (e.g., lac UV 5), a tryptophan (trp) promoter, a trp-lac hybrid promotor (e.g., tac, tacII, trc), a λ phage P L  promoter and P R  promoter, T7 promoter, tetracycline resistant gene (tet) promoter, trp-tet and lac-tet hybrid promoter, β-lactamase promoter,  Escherichia   coli  outer membrane protein gene (lpp) promoter, synthetic promoter (e.g., DNA of bases 82 containing  E.   coli  trp promoter and operator), and the like. Of these promoters, the lac promoter is particularly favored. 
     
    
    [0015]
     In the preparation of a plasmid in accordance with the present invention, the utilizable vectors include known or commercially available vectors per se, or vectors derived from the same, depending on the application. For example, it is convenient to prepare a plasmide wherein an expression vector is previously integrated with an element of the above-mentioned promoter sequences, Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences, terminator sequences, and the like. Further, other elements include the above-mentioned signal peptide coding DNA sequence; for example, if  E.   coli  is employed as a host cell, these include alkaline phosphatase, OmpF, protein A, β-lactamase (penicillinase), lipoprotein, endotexin, and the like. 
     
    
    [0016]
     The expression plasmids include plasmids of the Col El type such as pBR series, pUC series, etc., plasmids of the P15A type such as pACYC series, etc., plasmids of the F factor type such as mini F vector, etc., plasmids of the R factor type such as pSC101, etc., and plasmids derived from phage, such as pUC118 and 119, etc.. In particular, pTV118N, pTV119, and the like, which also comprise lac promoter, SD sequence, translational initiation codon, cloning site and terminator, are preferred. 
     
    
    [0017]
     Accordingly, in the plasmids in accordance with the present invention, preferably the DNA sequence encoding PLA₂ inhibitory protein is incorporated into a cloning site of the above-mentioned vector, and specifically, include ppTC3/2.1, pTRC3/1.035 and pTHC3/1.050. Such plasmids can be obtained by conventional methods from  E.   coli  pTC3/2.1, J9TRC3/1.035 and J9THC3/1.050 strains; the  E.   coli  JM109 strains being transformed by a conventional method using the above plasmids, i.e., ppTC3/2.1, pTRC3/1.035 and pTHC3/1.050, and deposited under deposit numbers FERM BP-3027 (transferred from FERM P-11431 deposited on April 26, 1990), FERM BP-3485 (deposited on July 17, 1991) and FERM BP-3486 (deposited on July 17, 1991), respectively, at the international depositary authority of the Fermentation Research Institute of Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japan. 
     
    
    [0018]
     The plasmids, including such plasmids can be prepared by an insertion of the DNA sequence encoding PLA₂ inhibitory protein to a cloning site of the above vector, for example, according to the construction procedures for plasmids known per se and shown in Figure 1, Figures 2(a) and (b), and Figures 3(a) and (b). 
     
    
    [0019]
     The recombinant microbial cells can be obtained by a transformation of a microbial cell with the plasmid described above. For this transformation, preferably a CaCl₂ method is used. 
     
    
    [0020]
     The host cells for the above-mentioned recombinant include, for example, microbial cells belonging to  Eschericia ,  Bacillus ,  Saccharomyces , and the like. In particular, microbial cells belonging to  Eschericia , and more particularly,  Eschericia   coil  JM109, are preferred. 
     
    
    [0021]
     Thus, the recombinant microbial cells specifically enclose  E.   coli  pTC3/2.1 (FERM BP-3027),  E.   coli  J9TRC 3/1.035(FERM BP-3485), and  E.   coli  J9THC 3/1.050 (FERM BP-3486), which are transformed using the preferred plasmids in accordance with the present invention. 
     
    
    [0022]
     The above-mentioned recombinant microbial cells are useful for the production of a protein having an inhibitory activity against phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites. 
     
    
    [0023]
     Namely, the present invention also provides a method of producing the inhibitory protein for phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites (PLA₂ inhibitory protein), and comprises culturing the recombinant microbial cells in a nutrient medium to produce the PLA₂ inhibitory protein, and recovering the inhibitory protein from the cultures. The culturing can be carried out under ordinary conditions for a culturing of  E.   coli , and further, a usual carbon source can be used as the nutrient medium, or a nitrogen source and other inorganic salts and trace amount of metals and vitamins can be used. According to the present method, the PLA₂ inhibitory protein is abundantly accumulated as the inclusion body in the microbial cells, or alternatively, the inhibitory protein is accumulated as extracellular protein in the cultured medium when the DNA sequences encoding a signal peptide are used. 
     
    
    [0024]
     When recovering the PLA₂ inhibitory protein from the cultured medium, the microbial cells are subjected to a lysis, such as a treatment with a cell wall lytic enzyme or sonication, to degrade the cell wall, or the microbial cells are removed from the cultured medium, followed by isolation and purification procedures, known per se, for proteins. More particularly, in the former case, the collected microbial cells are subjected to, for example, sonication, or the like to recover the inclusion bodies, the inclusion bodies are solubilized with urea, the treated solution is applied to a gel filtration column to remove the urea, and the resulting protein is subjected to pyridylethylation to protect SH groups. 
     
    
    [0025]
     The protein having protected SH groups is then fractionated with gel filtration HPLC to yield fractions containing mainly a recombinant protein derived from a C3α gene. 
     
    
    [0026]
     The fractions are further isolated and purified with a reverse phase HPLC, etc., based on an inhibitory activity against the rat phospholipase A₂ from inflammatory sites. 
     
    
    [0027]
     The above-mentioned inhibitory activity or inhibitory protein can be determined, or traced, as follows. 
   (A)  Determination of Inhibitory Activity to Phospholipase A₂ from Inflammatory sites   
   
    
    [0028]
     Enzyme used was a phospholipase A₂ isolated and purified from the peritoneal cavity of caseinate-treated rats, and the substrate used was ¹⁴C-phosphatidylethanol amine isolated and purified from  E.   coli  cultured together with ¹⁴C-acetic acid (about 2,000 dmp/nmol, 0.1 mM). 
     
    
    [0029]
     In the enzyme reaction, to a reaction mixture containing 50 µl of 0.5M Tris·HCl (pH 9.0), 25 µl of 40 mM CaCl₂ , and 25 µl of substrate, a sample and water were added to a total volume of 240 µl, and finally, 10 µl of an enzyme solution (0.1 ng/µl) was added. The incubation was performed at 37°C for 10 minutes, and thereafter, to the reaction mixture was added Dole's reagent (1.5 ml), to stop the reaction, and the ¹⁴C-acetic acid generated was extracted using Dole's method, followed by a determination with a liquid scintillation counter. 
   (B)  SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western-Blotting   
   
    
    [0030]
     To each of the samples prepared from the treated culture or the purification steps was added one tenth of dye solution (0.1% BPB, XC, 10% SDS) by volume, the solution was heated to 100°C for 5 min, and the reaction mixture then applied to 12.5% polyacrylamide gel with 1% SDS. Thereafter, an electrophoresis was performed at from 15 to 25 mA for 1.5 hours. When an analysis of the samples was carried out under a reductive condition, to each of the samples was added 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME). After the electrophoresis, the gels were subjected to CBB staining, for a detection of the protein. 
     
    
    [0031]
     Alternatively, after the electrophoresis as described above, the protein was transferred with an electro-blotting apparatus (MILLIPORE) from the gel to a nitrocellulose filter, and the gel was subjected to an enzyme-linked immunostaining method using anti-human C3d sheep serum (Dako), horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Cappel) and 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-Rad), to detect the C3d or C3dg band. 
     
    
    [0032]
     The phospholipase A₂ inhibitory protein from inflammatory sites thus obtained was, for example, comprised mainly by the amino acid sequences represented in the "Sequence Listing"  sequence numbers  1 or 3. As described below, it was confirmed that the proteins have a very specific inhibitory activity against the phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites, and further, have suppressive effect on allergic reactions. It was also confirmed that proteins known to specifically inhibit phospholipase A₂ from inflammatory sites, such as the protein originated from rat peritioneal cavity as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63(1988)-246397, the protein prepared by using an enzyme from a human complement component C3 as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2 (1990)-91100, and the proteins purified from rat or human serum disclosed in International Publication No. WO91/1999, have the above-mentioned suppressive effect on allergic reactions. Surprisingly, it was found that this effect is due to fact that such inhibitory proteins inhibit a degranulation of mast cells. 
     
    
    [0033]
     Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition for a suppression of allergic reaction containing the phospholipase A₂ inhibitory protein as an active ingredient. The inhibitory protein includes a protein obtainable through genetic engineering procedures according to the invention, a protein isolated and purified from mammals and a protein prepared from the complement component C3. 
     
    
    [0034]
     The term "allerigic reaction" means a reaction occurring when an antigenic sensitized organism is again subjected to the same antigenic sensitization, and in particular, includes an immediate allergy such as anaphylaxis and Arthus reaction induced in mast cells. As mammalian, in particular human, diseases discussed herein, asthma, measles, and the like, are particularly mentioned. 
     
    
    [0035]
     In the present invention, an oral drug such as a soft capsule, a hard capsule, a tablet, or a syrup, an injection, or a surgical drug, all of which may be prepared by using the PLA₂ inhibitory proteins as an active ingredient and an appropriate excipient in a proper known manner may be utilized. 
     
    
    [0036]
     The dosage of the active ingredient is usually about 1 to 500 mg/day/person and the number of doses is usually 1 to 3 times/day, and thus a preparation fulfilling such conditions is preferably prepared. Further, the active ingredient does not show an acute toxicity to mammals in the range of the above-mentioned dose. The depressant of the present invention also may be used together with existing drugs. 
     
    
    [0037]
     The efficacy of the PLA₂ inhibitory proteins with respect to a pharmaceutical composition for the suppression of allergic reactions is illustrated by the following tests. 
   (C)  Determination of Inhibitory Activity (Suppression of   Histamine Release) upon IgE-Antigen-Lyso-PS Dependent Activation of Rat CTMC   
 (1) Preparation of Rat Connective Tissue Type Mast Cell (CTMC) 
   
    
    [0038]
     The peritoneal cavities of male Whistar rats (having a weight of not less than 500 g) are each injected with 50 ml of a Hank's solution containing 10 µ/ml of heparin, and massaged more than 100 times. The Hank's solution is collected by opening the pertoneal cavity. The cells are collected by centrifugation at 100 x g for 5 minutes, and then the Hank's solution is collected. After being suspended in 1 mℓ of Hank's solution, the suspension is gently layered on 5 mℓ of a Hank's solution in which 40% bovine serum albumin (BSA) had been dissolved, and centrifuged at 450 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The cells residing in the lowermost layer are collected and washed with a Hank's solution, to obtain peritoneal cavity mast cell (purity: more than 90%). About 10⁶ cells are obtained per rat. 
   (2) Method of Activation of Rat CTMC 
   
    
    [0039]
     The resulting peritoneal cavity mast cells are resuspended in a Hank's solution containing 0.1% gelatine (5 x 10⁶/mℓ), and 1 µg/mℓ of anti-DNP IgE-antibody (Miles) is added thereto to be subjected to passive sensitization. The cells are washed, and re-suspended in the Hank's solution containing 0.1% gelatine to a cell concentration of 1 to 2 x 10⁶/mℓ, an adequate amount of antigen, DNP-Ascharis [a method according to Eisen  et.   al  (I. Am. Chem. Soc., 75. 4583 (1953))], and 10-⁶ M lysophosphatidylserine (Avanti) are added thereto, and the mixture is incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes to activate the cells. The reaction is stopped by adding EDTA, to be 2 mM. 
   (3) Determination of Histamine Released from Activated Rat Mast Cell 
 (a) Preparation of Histamine N-Methyltransferase 
   
    
    [0040]
     An SD rat's kidney (200 g) is homogenized with 0.25 M sucrose solution in a volume 9 times the wet weight of the kidney, and centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 1 hour. To the supernatant is added ammonium sulfate, and 45-70% ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction is recovered, and then is dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and dialyzed against a 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This standard is used as the HMT. 
   (b) Determination of Histamine 
   
    
    [0041]
     A sample containing histamine (19-50 µℓ) is placed in a test tube, an adequate amount of HMT and 1µℓ of ³H (tritiated) S-adenosylmethionine (New England Nuclear) are added thereto, and a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.9) is added to adjust the total volume to 200 µℓ. After incubation at 37°C for 90 minutes, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 µℓ of 2.5 N NaOH. Subsequently, 2 mℓ of chloroform is further added to extract the ³H-methyl histamine into the chloroform layer. The water layer and chloroform layer are separated by centrifugation at room temperature for 5 minutes, and the water layer is then removed. To the remaining chloroform layer is added 200 µℓ of 2.5 N NaOH, to carry out the extraction again, thereby washing the chloroform layer. A certain amount of the resulting chloroform layer is dispensed in a vial bottle, and dried to form a solid, and there after, a toluene type scintillator is added to count the radioactivity. 
   
 Example 
 
   
    
    [0042]
     The following examples are illustrative of the invention, and in no way limit same. 
   
 Example 1 (referential example): Cloning of Inhibtory Protein for Phospholipase A₂ originated from Inflammatory Sites 
 
   
    
    [0043]
     
     
 (A) A plasmids pFC4/5.4 containing a mouse C3 cDNA fragment (J.B.C. 260, 10936, 1986) were digested with Hind III, and the resulting digested material was applied to a low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis to separate 2.2 kbp fragments. Further, 1.8 kbp fragments were obtained from Stu I digested material using the same procedure. 
 (B) Screening of cDNA 
   Rat liver cDNA λgt ll libraries  (Clontech ) were used as the material for screening, and the screening procedures were carried out according to the protocol of Clontech.  
Namely, λgt ll phage infected  E.   coli  Y 1090 strains were cultured at 37°C for 5 hours to yield about 5 x 10⁴ transformants, the resulting transformants were subjected to replication on a Nylon filter membrane, the filter was dipped in 1.5M NaOH-1.5M NaCl to be denatured and then neutralized with Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1.5M NaCl - 1mM EDTA. The filter was then dried by air, and exposed to ultraviolet rays from a trans-illuminator, to immobilize DNA on the filter.
 
As a probe for the screening, ³²P labelled mouse C3 cDNA fragments, as described (A), were used.
 
The transformations on the test filter were hybridized with the probe at 65°C, for the screening, and then detected by autoradiography. As a result, seven positive clones were found among the about 5 x 10⁴ transformants, and these positive clones were designated as λrC3/11-17, respectively.
 
The above clones were digested with EcoRI, subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and then the chain length of insert genes was determined by Southern hybridization. As a result, it was found that λrC3/11 of the above-mentioned clones had the longest insert gene fragment, in which the full length is 2.7 kbp, and were digested with EcoRI to yield 0.7 kbp and 2.0 kbp fragments.
 
 (C) Sequence Determination for Rat C3 cDNA 
   After λrC3/11 phage DNA's were isolated from the clone, the resulting DNA's were digested with EcoRI to yield DNA 0.7 kbp and 2.0 kbp fragments. These fragments were inserted into the EcoRI cleavage sites of a cloning vector pUC19 and phage M13MP 19RE DNA (Takara Shuzo) for sequencing. The 0.1 kbp and 0.6 kbp fragments from the 0.7 kbp fragment were inserted in a sequencing vector pUC118 double digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and were subjected to sequencing from both terminals.  
The sequence determination was made in accordance with the 7-DEAZA method (Mizusawa, et al., Nucreic Acid Res. 14, 1319, 1986). In the sequencing of a 2kbp fragment, the method of Hood et al. (Hood, et al, Anal. Biochem. 154, 353, 1986), in which primers corresponding to parts of clarified sequences are synthesized and a sequence determination conducted, was used.
 
Following the above procedures, a sequence determination as described in International Publication No. WO 91/01999 was carried out, and as a result, an full nucleotide sequence obtained and its deduced amino acid sequence of rat inhibitory protein for phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites are shown as "Sequence Listing,"  sequence numbers  3 and 1, respectively.
 
Also, an full nucleotide sequence obtained and its deduced amino acid sequence of human inhibitory protein for phospholipase A₂ originated from inflammatory sites, according to a sequencing in a similar manner as the above-mentioned procedures, are shown as "Sequence Listing," sequence numbers 4 and 2, respectively.
 
 
 
 Example 2: Construction of C3α Expression Plasmid The procedure of the construction was based on Fig. 1. 
 
   
    
    [0044]
     An  E.   coli  expression vector pTV119N (Takara Shuzo) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI. A rat C3 cDNA clone pTC3/11 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, the fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis was separated, and a 0.1 kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment and 2.0 kb EcoRI-EcoRI fragment were recovered. 
     
    
    [0045]
     The ligation reaction was carried out between the digested vector and 0.1 kb fragment, and  E.   coli , JM109 was transformed, and there after, was cultured on an ampicillin plate to yield a transformant. The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the transformant, and the plasmid was designated as "ppTC3/0.1". 
     
    
    [0046]
     The plasmid "ppTC3/0.1" was digested with EcoRI, and then subjected to a ligation reaction together with the 2.0 kb fragment. After the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the transformant in a similar manner, the nucleotide sequence was detected at the BamHI site by the dideoxy method. From the nucleotide sequence, the plasmid that had been correctly inserted was selected, and was designated as "ppTC3/2.1". 
     
    
    [0047]
     In the above-procedure, the vector DNA and restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzo. In the recovery of the DNA from the agarose gel, and in the purification of the plasmid from the transformant, GENECLEAN available from BIO 101 Corp was used. The ligation reaction was carried out using a ligation kit produced by Takara Shuzo. The detection of the nucleotide sequence was carried out by using an M13 Primer RV-N and 7-DEAZA Sequencing Kit, both from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. 
     
    
    [0048]
     Since the vector, pTV119N, used herein possesses a lac promoter, the expression of the desired protein is induced by the addition of IPTG to the medium. The protein, which is expressed by ppTC3/2.1, is a fusion protein having 16 residues of N-terminal portions of  E.   coli  β-galactosidase on the N-terminal side and 714 residues residing downstream of the rat 3α-chain on the C-terminal side, and having a molecular weight of about 80 kDa. 
     
    
    [0049]
     The fusion protein is produced by culturing the recombinant  E.   coli  pTC3/2.1 strain (FERM BP-3027) so that  E.   coli  JM109 is transformed with the ppTC3/2.1 according to the potassium chloride method. 
   
 Example 3: Construction of Rat Met-C3dg Expression Plasmid 
 
   
    
    [0050]
     The construction procedure followed that shown in Figures 2(a) and (b). 
     
    
    [0051]
     The plasmid ppTC3/2.1 was digested with EcoRI to yield 2.0 kb of an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment, and the obtained fragment was further digested with FokI to yield 1.0 kb of an EcoRI-FokI fragment. A DNA was synthesized such that a protein synthetic termination codon TGA was added to 14bp from the 3' terminal of a rat C3dg gene, based on a DNA sequence of the rat C3dg, and then subjected to annealing to form a double-stranded synthetic DNA fragment of FokI-BanII. An expression vector pTV119N (Takara shuzo) was digested with EcoRI and BanII, and the fragment thus obtained was subjected to a ligation reaction together with 1.0 kb of an EcoRI-FoKI fragment and the synthetic DNA fragment of FoKI-BanII, and  E.   Coli  JM109 strains were transformed with the fragments and then cultured on an LB agar medium containing ampcillin, to yield transformants. A plasmid DNA extracted from the transformants was purified, and designated as "pTRC3/0.973". 
     
    
    [0052]
     The plasmid pTRC3/0.973 was digested with NcoI and EcoRI. A DNA was synthesized such that, upstream of a 5' terminal 596p of rat C3dg gene was ligated a protein synthetic initiation codon ATG, and then subjected to annealing, to yield two double-stranded NcoI - EcoRI fragments. The ligation reaction was carried out between the synthesized DNA fragment and digested pTRC3/0.973 and  E.   coli  JM 109 was transformed, and then after, was cultured on an LB agar medium containing ampcillin, to yield transformants. The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the transformants, the nucleotide sequence was detected upstream at 26 bp of the NcoI cleaved site and downstream at 41 bp of the BanII cleaved site by the dideoxy method, and a plasmid having inserted therein 1032 bp of rat C3dg cDNA between the protein synthetic initiation codon and termination codon, was designated as plasmid "pTRC3/1.035". 
     
    
    [0053]
     pTRC3/1.035 was used for a transformation of the JM109 to yield J9TRC3/1.035 (FERM BP-3485). 
     
    
    [0054]
     Since the vector pTV119N used herein possesses a lac promoter, the transformants cultured in a medium containing IPTG (iso-propyl-thiogalactoside) can be induced to express the desired protein. The expression protein from pTRC3/1.035 has methionine at the N terminal of rat C3dg 344 residue, and a molecular weight of about 39 kDa. 
   
 Example 4: Construction of Human Met-C3dg Expression Plasmid 
 
   
    
    [0055]
     The construction procedure was based on Figures 3(a) and (b). 
     
    
    [0056]
     An  E.   coli  expression vector pTV118N (Takara Shuzo) was digested with EcoRI and KpnI, a human C3 cDNA clone pHLC3.11 obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, U.S.A.) was digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and there after, 1.2 kb of an EcoRI - KpnI fragment was separated and recovered by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
     
    
    [0057]
     The ligation reaction was carried out between the digested vector and the 1.2kb fragment, and  E.   coli  JM109 was transformed, following by culturing on an LB agar medium to yield a transformant. The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the transformant, and was designated as "pTHC3/1.240. 
     
    
    [0058]
     The plasmid pTHC3/1.240 was digested with NcoI and EcoRI, and then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to yield 4.4 kb of an NcoI - EcoRI fragment. 5' terminal about 70 bp of human C3dg cDNA downstream of a protein synthetic initiation codon ATG was synthesized according to a known human C3dg cDNA nucleotide sequence, and subjected to annealing to yield a double-stranded Ncol - EcoRI fragment. 
     
    
    [0059]
     The ligation reaction was carried out between the 4.4 kb fragment from pTHC3/1.240 and the synthesized DNA fragment, and  E.   coli  JM109 was transformed, followed by culturing on an LB agar medium containing ampicillin to yield a transformant. The plasmid was extracted and purified from the transformant, and was designated as "pTHC3/1.317". 
     
    
    [0060]
     The plasmid pTHC3/1.317 was completely digested with KpnI, and further, partially digested with EcoT14I, where after 4.0 kb of KpnI - EcoT14I fragment was separated and recovered by agarose gel electrophoresis. Further, a DNA ligated protein synthetic termination codon TAG to a 3' terminal of about 80 bp of human C3dg cDNA was synthesized according to a human C3dg cDNA nucleotide sequence, and was subjected to annealing to yield a double-stranded EcoT14I - KpnI fragment. 
     
    
    [0061]
     The ligation reaction was carried out between the 4.0 kb fragment from pTHC3/1.317 and the synthesized fragment, and  E.   coli  was transformed, whereafter it was cultured on an LB agar medium containing ampcillin to yield a transformant. The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified from the transformant, and then from 26 bases upstream of NcoI cleavaged site and 43 bases downstream of a KpnI cleaved site, the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy method. As a result, the plasmid having inserted therein 1047 bp of human C3dg cDNA, between the protein synthesis initiation codon and termination codon, was designated as "pTHC3/1.050". 
     
    
    [0062]
     Using thus obtained pTHC3/1.050, JM109 was transformed by the ordinary calcium chloride method to yield the recombinant  E.   coli  J9THC3/1.050 (FERM BP-3486). 
     
    
    [0063]
     Since the vector, pTV119N, used herein possesses a lac promoter, the expression of the desired protein is induced by the addition of IPTG to the medium. The protein expressed by pTHC3/1.050 has methionine at the N terminal of human C3dg 349 residue, and a molecular weight of about 39 kDa. 
   Example 5:  Expression of Inhibitory Protein for PLA₂ from purified Inflammatory Sites in E. coli and Purification of Expressed Protein   
   
    
    [0064]
     After pTC3/2.1 (FERM BP-3027), J9TRC3/1.035 (FERM BP-3485) or J9THC3/1.050 (FERM BP-3486) had been cultured in 10 mℓ of 2xTY medium containing 50 µg/mℓ of sodium ampicillin at 37°C overnight, the whole amount was transferred to a total volume 1 ℓ of the same medium, and the culture was carried out at 37°C. After about 5 hours, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 100 µM, and the culture was continued for another 3 hours. 
     
    
    [0065]
     The cells of cultures were independently collected, and 2-ME and SDS were each added thereto, the total proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE for a separation, and the separated proteins then transferred by an electro-blotting apparatus from Bio-Rad Co. LTD. to a nitrocellulose filter. After the transfer, the filter membranes were processed by blocking with 20 mM. PBS (pH 7.5) containing 3% BSA, and then the proteins were reacted with each dilute solution in which, in the case of pTC3/2.1, were goat anti-rat C3 serum (CAPPEL), and in the case of J9TRC3/1.035 and J9THC3/1.050, were rabbit anti-human C3d serum (DAKO) diluted with PBS containing 1% BSA by 100 times, respectively, at 4°C for 4 hours. After they were washed by PBS, the proteins were independently reacted with each dilute solution which, in the pTC3/2.1 case, was swine anti-goat IgG antibody-HRPO complex (TAGO), in the J9TRC3/1.035 and J9THC3/1.050 cases was sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibody-HRPO complex (Bio-Rad), diluted with PBS containing 1% BSA by 500 times, respectively, at 4°C for 2 hours. After they were washed by PBS, the membranes were stained with a Konica Immunostain HPR Kit, and as a result, it was confirmed that, with respect to pTC3/2.1 a rat C3α fusion protein having a molecular weight of about 80 kDa, with respect to J9THC3/1.050, a Met-human C3dg having a molecular weight of about 39 kDa, and with respect to J9TRC3/1.035, a Met-rat C3dg having a molecular weight about 39 kDa, were expressed, respectively. 
     
    
    [0066]
     With respect to pTC3/2.1, the remaining culture was further subjected to centrifugation at 3,000 G for 5 minutes to collect the cells, and suspended in 40 mℓ of 50 mM Tris.HCℓ (pH 7.5) buffer, after which a sonication (Kubota INSONATRON 201M) was conducted at the maximum output for 5 minutes to destory the cells. The inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 G for 10 minutes, and 10 mℓ of 8M urea-100 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) was added thereto, after which the mixture was left standing at room temperature for 30 minutes to solubilize the inclusion proteins. After insolubles were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 minutes, the solution was applied to a gel filtration column ( PD  10 column, Pharmacia) in order to remove urea, and eluted with 10 mM ammonium acetate, lyophilization by freeze-drying. 
     
    
    [0067]
     About 30 mg of the lyophilized sample was dissolved in 2 mℓ of 0.2 M ethylmorpholine acetate (pH 8.0) containing 1% SDS, 2 µℓ of 2-mercaptoethanol (2ME) was added thereto, and the mixture was left to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. After 2 µℓ of 2ME had been newly added, and the mixture was left to stand at room temperature for another 30 minutes, 3 µℓ of 4-vinyl pyridine was added to cause a reaction for 1 hour. 
     
    
    [0068]
     After 3 µℓ of 4-vinyl pyridine was been further added, to bring about a reaction at room temperature for another 1 hour, the reaction mixture was immediately applied to a gel filtration HPLC (TSKgel G3000SW). The elution was carried out with 50 mM Tris·HCℓ-150 mM NaCℓ (pH 7.5) at 0.5 mℓ/min. 
     
    
    [0069]
     When the gel filtration fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the 80 kDa fusion protein was proven to be eluted around the 24th fraction (Figures 4(a) and (b). This fraction was further purified with reverse phase HPLC (Vydac, Protein C4) to give the final sample. 
     
    
    [0070]
     The amount of protein purified from 1 ℓ of the  E.   coli . culture was about 600 µg. 
     
    
    [0071]
     In the above-described procedures, the HPLC was carried out using a Spectra-Physics pump system SP 8700, applied spectroscopic UV detector UVILOG-511 A, LKB fraction collector 2112, and Reodine sample injector 7125. The SDS-PAGE was carried out using a 5-20% gradient gel (ATTO Pagel), and stained with CBB (Sigma). 
   
 Example 6: Identification of Purified Protein 
 
 (1) Identification by immunoblott Method 
   
    
    [0072]
     After the gel filtration HPLC fraction had been separated with SDS-PAGE, the gel was shaken in a 25 mM Tris-HCl-192 mM glycine buffer containing 20% methanol for 30 minutes, and the transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane was carried out by using an electroblotting apparatus (Immuno Blot, Bio-Rad) 0.5 A, 30 minutes). 
     
    
    [0073]
     The transferred membrane was processed by blocking with 20 mM PBS (pH 7.5) containing 3% BSA while shaking for 1 hour, and then reacted with goat anti-rat C3 antibody (CAPPEL) which had been diluted with 20 mM PBS by 100 times at 4°C for 4 hours. 
     
    
    [0074]
     After washing three times with PBS containing 1% Tween-20, it was then reacted with goat anti-rat IgG antibody-HRPO complex (TAGO) which had been diluted with PBS containing 1% BSA by 500 times, at 4°C for 2 hours, and after washing three times with PBS containing 1% Tween-20, it was stained with the Konica Immunostain HPR kit. 
     
    
    [0075]
     As a result, it was confirmed that the 80 kDa protein band eluting around #24 had been reacted with the anti-rat C3 antibody, and thus was the desired fusion protein. 
   (2) Detection of N-Terminal Amino Acid Sequence 
   
    
    [0076]
     After the final sample purified with reverse phase HPLC was dried by using a vacuum centrifugal concentrator, it was dissolved in 80% acetonitrile-0.1% TFA, and applied to a gas phase protein sequenced (Applied Biosystems, Model 477A) to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence. 
     
    
    [0077]
     As a result, it was proven that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of 80 kDa fusion protein was determined to be the following amino acid sequence; 
NH₂-Ala-Met-Ile-Thr-Pro-X-Ser- 
   This sequence agreed with the sequence expected, although only the first Met is deleted from the  E.   coli  β-galactosidase. It could be considered that the N-terminal Met had been deleted in some mechanism after the synthesis of the desired 80 kDa fusion protein. 
   
 Example 7: Phospholipase A₂ Inhibitory Activities of C3α-Chain Fusion Protein 
 
   
    
    [0078]
     The phospholipase A₂ inhibitory activities of the gel filtration  HPLC fraction # 24 was determined. 
     
    
    [0079]
     The activity determination system was prepared by adding distilled water to 100 mM Tris·HCl (pH 9.0), 4 mM Calcium chloride, 0.1 mM [¹⁴C]-phosphatidylethanol amine (2,000 dpm/nmol), and 10-100 µℓ of sample to attain a total amount of 240 µℓ, mixing them, and finally adding 10 µℓ of 0.1 ng/µℓ phospholipase A₂ thereto. In this case, phospholipase A₂ secreted from rat platelet was used (the same as the inflammatory site-originated type). The phosphatidylethanolamine was purified from  E.   coli , which had been cultured in a medium containing [¹⁴C]-acetic acid. The reaction was carried out at 37°C for 10 minutes, with shaking. The termination of the reaction and the extraction of the fatty acid were carried out according to the Dole's method, and the extracted [¹⁴C]-fatty acid was measured with a scintillation counter. 
     
    
    [0080]
     The results are shown in Figure 5. The present fraction inhibited the phospholipase A₂ from platelet in a dose dependent manner. The amount of the protein required for inhibiting 1 ng of the  phospholipase A₂ activity  50% was about 50 ng. The specific activity per molecular weight of the inhibitory protein was about 1/5 times that of the rat C3dg purified from the serum (see, W091/01999) 
     
    
    [0081]
     Additionally, when the protein was evaluated for inhibitory activities against various phospholipase A₂ , although it had a highly inhibitory activity against phospholipase A₂ from rat inflammatory sites, phospholipase A₂ from human inflammatory sites, and phospholipase A₂ from  Crotalus   adamanteum  venom similar to that of rat C3dg purified from rat platelet, the protein had no inhibitory activity against phospholipase A₂ from swine spleen and phospholipase A₂ from  Naja   naja  venom. 
   
 Example 8: Effects of the Rat C3α Fusion Protein upon IgE-Antigen-Lysophosphatidylserine (ps)-Dependent-Activation of Rat CTMC 
 
   
    
    [0082]
     The activation of mast cells described under the above-described (C) (2) was repeated, but the rat C3α-chain fusion protein obtained in Example 5 was added simultaneously with the antigen and lyso-PS. That in which no inhibitory protein had been added was measured as a control. As a result, the release of histamine was inhibited as shown in Fig. 5. In combination with the results of Example 7, it was clarified that the present fusion protein inhibited type II PLA₂ , whereby the release of histamine was inhibited. In the Figure, the mark o represents control, and o is the present protein. 
     
    
    [0083]
     Although the concentration of tranilast, which is a depressant for release of histamine, required for exhibiting preferential release depressing activity is 10⁻⁴ M, in the case of the rat C3α-chain fusion protein, the concentration is 2.5 x 10⁻⁷ M, showing that the present protein clearly possesses a very strong activity for depressing inflammatory reactions. 
   
 Industrial Applicability 
 
   
    
    [0084]
     The present plasmid and recombinant microbial cell, and the method of producing the phospholipase A₂ inhibitory protein using the same, may be useful, for example, for a production of a remedy for mammals, especially human, allergies, since the protein has a suppressive action against allergic reactions thereof.
