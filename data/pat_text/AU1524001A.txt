More specifically the invention relates to the protein LppQ of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and DNA encoding said protein. The invention relates to serological detection of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type (SC) infections, the etiological agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and the design of any type of vaccine, in particular marker vaccines for the differentiation of infected animals from vaccinated animals. The specific lipoprotein LppQ, and especially its N-terminal antigenic part is expressed as recombinant peptide to be used as specific antigen for sero-detection of CBPP. Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type (SC) is a severe disease affecting cattle as well as buffaloes. CBPP creates great economic losses in endemic regions and is declared by the Office International des Epiozooties (OlE) to be a disease of list "A", which contains the most serious contagious animal diseases; these diseases require special international regulations for their eradication. CBPP was eradicated from most continents during the 1 9 1h century but remained endemic in Africa. In spite of strict sanitary control measures it is re-emerging in Europe since 1980, thus conceiving a serious threat for animal health and for livestock production (ter Laak, 1992; Nicholas and Bashiruddin, 1995; Provost et al., 1987; Egwu et al., 1996). Serodiagnosis is the most important tool for control of CBPP. Several serological tests have been described during the last fifty years including slide agglutination, complement fixation (CF) (Campbell and Turner, 1953), agar gel precipitation (Gourlay and Shifrine, 1965), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, passive haemagglutination, Western-blot and dot blot (Nicholas et al., 1996). Complement fixation (CF) test is currently the most widely used serological diagnostic test (Nicholas et al., 1996), and is WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 2 thought to be specific and sensitive in the acute phase of the disease. However, the CF test is reported to detect only about 70% of chronically infected animals and seems not to detect asymptomatic animals in the early stage of infection (Provost et al., 1987). In addition, problems with specificity of CF test are experienced; recent analysis of samples from monitoring of cattle in an area without CBPP has shown a significant number of false positive results (Stark et al., 1995b; Stark et al., 1995a). Recently a competitive ELISA has been developed for the serodiagnosis of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infections based on a monoclonal antibody which detects a specific epitope of a 80 kDa antigen of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (Le and Thiaucourt, 1998). So far no specific antigen of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and no simple test such as noncompetitive indirect solid phase ELISA (capture of antibodies) currently exists for serodetection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infections. For indirect ELISAs, the quality of antigen preparations is decisive for the specificity and the sensitivity of the test. Total cell antigens or extracts of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC contain many antigens which cross react with related mycoplasmas and cannot be used. Part of the present invention comprises the use of a single specific lipoprotein of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC as antigen for serological tests. Vaccines so far are based on attenuated strains of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and are used as life vaccines. These vaccines, however, do not permit the differentiation of vaccinated cattle from infected cattle which is a major hinder in control and eradication programmes where vaccination is used. Recently Abdo et al. (1998) have analysed the course of immune reactions of the manifold antigens of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC in bronchial lavage and serum of cattle experimentally infected with the African strain Afad6 (deposited at the European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4OJG.UK, deposition number: 99081024) and the European strain L2 using Western blots and complement fixation. Several common dominant immunogenic antigens with the molecular masses of 110, 95, 85, 80, 72, 62, 48 and 39 kDa were identified. Since a lot of strains of mycoplasmas very closely related to M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC are known, it was questionable if any of the identified immunogenic antigens were specific for M. 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 3 mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. However, it was now surprisingly found that the 48 kDa protein listed above has the specificity for M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC allowing the person skilled in the art to develop the embodiments of the present invention as described below. The current invention is the discovery of a lipoprotein antigen named LppQ which is specific to M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and its use or the use of part of this protein, in particular the N-terminal half of the peptide as a specific antigen for serodetection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infections by using the peptide e.g. as specific antigen in noncompetitive indirect solid phase ELISA or any other serological test method. The invention includes the gene sequence of IppQ for the expression of antigens, or for the use in genetic identification or detection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC or for the design and production of any type of vaccine against M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. This includes the design of marker vaccines by construction of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC strains which are devoid of LppQ biosynthesis, the formulation of vaccines using LppQ as a component as well as vaccination procedures using the gene sequence of /ppQ (e.g. DNA vaccines). The present invention provides a specific protein of the membrane of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and its corresponding gene and gene sequence data for the specific serodetection of animals infected with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. The protein, named LppQ, is a lipoprotein of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. Its corresponding gene /ppQ was cloned from strain Afade from of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. The gene sequence of /ppQ and the corresponding amino acid sequence of the protein LppQ is presented in Table 5. The gene /ppQ is present in the type strain PG1 as well as in all European and African field isolates of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC tested as determined by PCR (see Table 1). 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 4 In order to express /ppQ in recombinant E. coli strains and other gene expression systems, the gene sequence was mutated in order to change UGA to UGG,. In total 9 UGA codons had to be changed to UGGp by point mutagenesis. Three synthetic genes have been constructed: " /ppQ* encoding the total lppQ gene but containing the universal genetic code that can be read by E. coli and other hosts for gene expression (Table 6). The plasmid containing the lppQ* gene is pJFFmaLP48-MuHisl (deposited at the European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4OJG.UK, deposition number: 99081025). . /ppQ*N'encoding the N'terminal, antigenic, part of LppQ, LppQN'. The /ppQ*N' contains the universal genetic code (Table 8). The plasmid containing the IppQ*N' gene is pJFFLP48-1 1. . /ppQ*C', encoding the C'terminal part of LppQ, LppQC'. The /ppQ*C' contains the universal genetic code (Table 10). The plasmid containing the /ppQ*C'is pJFFmaLppQ-Cterm. The expression of the three synthetic genes present on the plasmids described above has been achieved using expression vector pETHIS-1. The gene sequence of plasmid pETHIS-1 is available in Genbank/EMBL accession nr AF012911. Plasmid pETHIS1 was constructed to allow the expression of fusion proteins with a N-terminal histidine hexamer and/or a C-terminal histidine decamer in specialised Escherichia coli host cells which contain inducible T 7 -RNA-polymerase genes as e.g. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (F-, ompT, r-(B),m-(B), lambda DE3, i21,lacl,lacUV5lacZ,T,-RNA-pol.(lysogenic),int-). The polyhistidine tailed LppQ-His peptides were purified by Ni-chelation chromatography. The N'terminal part of LppQ is the antigenic part of this lipoprotein. This is demonstrated by an immunoblot experiment, the results of which are shown in Table 12. Rabbit antiserum directed against full recombinant LppQ-His recognized both recombinant N-terminal LppQN'-His and recombinant C-terminal LppQC'-His as well as the full LppQ-His protein (Table 12, panel 1). Serum from a cow infected with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC from a CBPP outbreak in Italy from 1992 strongly WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 5 reacted with the recombinant N-terminal peptide of the protein, LppQN'-His, and with the full LppQ-His, but not with the C-terminal part LppQC'-His (Table 12, panel 2). The same observation was made with serum from an experimental infection. Serum from the early phase (Table 12, panel 4) and from the late phase of the infection showed strong reactions to LppQN' (Table 12, panel 5). No reaction was found in the control serum taken from the animal before infection (Table 12, panel 3). LppQ, and in particular the N-terminal part of the protein LppQN' is an early and persistent antigenic marker of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infections. This is demonstrated by immunoblot experiments with sera from controlled experimental infections of cattle with two different strains of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, an African strain Afade and an European strain L2 (Abdo et al., 1998). The sera from experimentally contact infected animals showed an early, strong and persistent response to LppQN'-His (Table 13). Representative sera from a cow which was contact infected with the European strain L2 showed clear signals on immunoblots containing LppQN'-His starting from day 92 post contact infection, concurrent with the first positive titer of the standard CF test and persisted until day 224 post contact infection (Table 13, part A) when the titer of the standard CF test was below the detection limit for already more than 2 months (Abdo et al., 1998). Representative sera from a cow infected with the African strain Afad6 showed a strong signal on day 28 post contact infection, concurrent with the first clear positive CF titer and persisted until day 134 post contact infection (Table 13, part B) when the titer of the standard CF test was below detection limit for 3 weeks (Abdo et al., 1998). The N-terminal part of LppQ (LppQN') is a specific antigen of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. Serum from a rabbit that was immunised with total cells of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC type strain PG1 strongly reacted with LppQN' on immunoblots, while sera from rabbits that were immunised with total cells of related mycoplasmas of the M. mycoides cluster or Mycoplasma putrefaciens showed no reaction with LppQN' His under the same conditions. In addition sera from Swiss cattle that were positive for Mycoplasma bovis but which were free of CBPP showed no reaction with LppQN'-His (Table 14). 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 6 The N-terminal part of LppQ (LppQN'-His) is produced in large amounts from plasmid pJFFLP48-11 harboured in E. coli strain JF1979 [BL21(DE3) (F-, ompT, r-(B),m-(B), lambda DE3, i21,Iacl,lacUV51acZ,T 7 -RNA-pol.(lysogenic),int-)/pJFFLP48-11 ApR]. LppQN'-His is directly purified from guanidium-hydorchloride solubilized cells by Ni chelate chromatography. A 50 ml culture of strain JF1979 yielded in 2 mg purified LppQN'-His protein. Other expression systems can be used for the production of LppQN' peptides or derivatives of it. The invention applies to the production of serological test kits such as immunoblots or noncompetitive indirect solid phase ELISA or any other antibody detection method for M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infections which are useful in screening of animals for CBPP and for carriers of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. "Immunological detection systems" means methods to detect antibodies directed against specific components of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC in sera of animals such as the immunoblots (see Table 12) and the ELISA as (see Table 2). These methods will be used for sero-diagnosis of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infections. Examples for an ELISA test using LppQN'-His-coated microtiterplates are given in Table 2. ELISA based on LppQN'-His-coated Microtiter plates was significantly more sensitive than CF test, in particular with sera taken at late phase post infection (see results Table 2). The IppQ gene can be used to design a system for genetic detection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. The specificity of the IppQ gene to M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC is demonstrated in Table 1 which shows that IppQ was present in all M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC strains isolated from different continents and countries and at different decades. The IppQ gene was not found in other Mycoplasmas in particular not in phenotypically and antigenically closely related animal Mycoplasmas.

A further embodiment of the invention is a monoclonal antibody specific for a protein according to item A, B or C. P. Another embodiment of the invention is a diagnostic kit containing a protein according to items A, B or C and / or at least one antibody as according to item 0 in a suitable container. Some of the embodiments of the invention as listed above are described in the following more detailed. The invention includes also LppQ fragments and variants. Polypeptides which qualify as LppQ variants can be produced, pursuant to the present invention, by conventional reverse genetic techniques, i.e., by designing a genetic sequence based upon an amino acid sequence or by conventional genetic splicing techniques. For example, LppQ variants can be produced by techniques which involve site-directed mutagenesis or WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/1 1798 11 oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. See, for example, "Mutagenesis of Cloned DNA," in CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 8.0.3 et seq. (Ausubel, et al. eds. 1989) ("Ausubel"). Other LppQ variants within the present invention are molecules that correspond to a portion of LppQ, or a fragment thereof, or that comprise a portion of LppQ but are not coincident with the natural polypeptide, both of which display the immunogenic activity of LppQ when presented alone or, alternatively, when linked to a carrier. A LppQ variant of this sort could represent an actual fragment of the natural molecule or could be a polypeptide synthesized de novo or recombinantly. In yet another embodiment, amino acid sequence variants of the protein are prepared. These may, for instance, be minor sequence variants of the protein which arise due to natural variation within the population of that microorganism from which the protein is identified, or they may be homologues of a protein found in other microorganisms. They also may be sequences which do not occur naturally in the protein but which are sufficiently similar that they elicit an immune response when administered to a host. Sequence variants can be prepared by standard methods of site-directed mutagenesis. Amino acid sequence variants of the protein can be substitutional, insertional or deletion variants. Deletion variants lack one or more residues of the native protein which are not essential for immunogenic activity. Another common type of deletion variant is one lacking secretory signal sequences or signal sequences directing a protein to bind to a particular part of a cell. Substitutional variants typically contain the exchange of one amino acid for another at one or more sites within the protein, and are designed to modulate one or more properties of the protein such as stability against proteolytic cleavage. Substitutions preferably are conservative, that is, one amino acid is replaced with one of similar shape and charge. Conservative substitutions are well known in the art and include, for example, the changes of: alanine to serine; arginine to lysine; asparigine to glutamine or histidine; aspartate to glutamate; cysteine to serine; glutamine to asparigine; glutamate to WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 12 aspartate; glycine to proline; histidine to asparigine or glutamine; isoleucine to leucine or valine; leucine to valine or isoleucire; lysine to arginine, glutamine, or glutamate; methionine to leucine or isoleucine; phenylalanine to tyrosine, leucine or methionine; serine to threonine; threonine to serine; tryptophan to tyrosine; tyrosine to tryptophan or phenylalanine; and valine to isoleucine or leucine. Insertional variants contain fusion proteins such as those used to allow rapid purification of the protein. Other insertional variants can include those in which additional amino acids are introduced within the coding sequence of the protein. These typically are smaller insertions than the fusion proteins described above and are introduced, for example, to disrupt a protease cleavage site. In another embodiment, major antigenic determinants of the protein are identified by an empirical approach in which portions of the gene encoding the protein are expressed in a recombinant host, and the resulting proteins tested for their ability to protect host animals from challenge. For example, PCR can be used to prepare a range of proteins lacking successively longer fragments of the C-terminus of the protein. The immuno activity of each of these proteins then identifies those fragments or domains of the protein which are essential for this activity. Further experiments in which only a small number of amino acids are removed at each iteration then allows the location of the antigenic determinants of the protein. Another embodiment for the preparation of the proteins of the invention is the use of peptide mimetics. Mimetics are peptide-containing molecules which mimic elements of protein secondary structure. See, for example, Johnson et al. (1993). The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions, such as those of antibody and antigen. A peptide mimetic protein of the present invention would, when administered to a host, elicit an immune response which would lead to recognition of the native host cell protein. 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/IEPOO/11798 13 Successful applications of the peptide mimetic concept have thus far focussed on mimetics of p-turns within proteins, which are known to be highly antigenic. Likely p-turn structure within an protein of the invention can be predicted by computer-based algorithms as discussed above. Once the component amino acids of the turn are determined, mimetics can be constructed to achieve a similar spatial orientation of the essential elements of the amino acid side chains, as discussed in Johnson et al., supra. The mimetic can then be conjugated to a carrier protein for use as a vaccine. In another embodiment, computer sequence analysis is used to determine the location of the predicted major antigenic determinant epitopes of the recombinant protein. Software capable of carrying out this analysis is readily available commercially, for example MacVector (lB1I, New Haven, CT). The software typically uses standard algorithms such as the Kyte/Doolittle or Hopp/Woods methods for locating hydrophilic sequences which are characteristically found on the surface of proteins and are, therefore, likely to act as antigenic determinants. Once this analysis is made, polypeptides can be prepared which contain at least the essential features of the antigenic determinant and which can be employed in vaccines. Genes encoding these determinants can be constructed and inserted into expression vectors by standard methods, for example, using PCR cloning methodology. As an alternative to recombinant polypeptides, synthetic peptides corresponding to the antigenic determinants can be prepared. Such peptides are at least six amino acid residues long, and may contain up to approximately 35 residues, which is the approximate upper length limit of automated peptide synthesis machines, such as those available from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Use of such small peptides in vaccines typically requires conjugation of the peptide to an immunogenic carrier protein such as hepatitis B surface antigen. Methods for performing this conjugation are well known in the art. The invention also relates to a vaccine. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the vaccine comprises the protein as described under item A, B or C or a fragment thereof, in WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 14 conjunction with a carrier or adjuvant and, where appropriate, auxiliary substances, for immunizing cattle against Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC. More generally, however, the vaccine of the present invention is intended for the immunization of a susceptible mammal. Mammals that are susceptible to Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC in addition to the bovine species include small and large ruminants. Following purification to an acceptable degree (which is generally in excess of 50% of the total peptide or protein), the antigen can then be administered to animals in the form of a vaccine. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the animals to be immunized are cattle. Where appropriate, whole cells may be used in vaccines. For example Sf9 cells or CHO cells expressing the recombinant antigen could be used directly, in live or killed form, to administer the antigen to host animals. Alternatively live viruses containing nucleic acid sequences encoding the antigens of the invention can be used in vaccines. The vaccine may include any of a number of different substances referred to as adjuvants, which are known to stimulate the appropriate portion of the immune system of the vaccinated animal. Suitable adjuvants for the vaccination of animals include, but are not limited to oil emulsions such as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant (not suitable for livestock use), Marcol 52:Montanide 888 (Marcol is a Trademark of Esso, Montanide is a Trademark of SEPPIC, Paris), squalane or squalene, Adjuvant 65 (containing peanut oil, mannide monooleate and aluminium monostearate), mineral gels such as aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, calcium phosphate and alum, surfactants such as hexadecylamine, octadecylamine, lysolecithin, dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide, N,N-dioctadecyl-N,N'-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) propanediamine, methoxyhexadecylglycerol and pluronic polyols, polyanions such as pyran, dextran sulfate, polyacrylic acid and carbopol, peptides and amino acids such as muramyl dipeptide, dimethylglycine, tuftsin and trehalose dimycolate. The antigens, expression products and/or synthetic polypeptides of the present invention also can be administered following incorporation into liposomes or other micro-carriers, or WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/1 1798 15 after conjugation to polysaccharides, proteins or polymers or in combination with Quil-A to form "Isocoms" (Immunostimulating complexes). Routes of administration, dosages to be administered, and frequency of injections are all factors which can be optimized using ordinary skill in the art. Typically, the initial vaccination is followed some weeks later by one or more "booster" vaccinations, the net effect of which is the production of vigorous cellular and humoral immune response. The method of immunizing a mammal against CBPP involves administering to the mammal an effective amount of the foregoing immunogen. Administration may involve any procedure well-known in the art. Any immunization route which may be contemplated or shown to produce an appropriate immune response can be employed, in accordance with the present invention, although subcutaneous administration is preferred. Suitable administration forms include parenteral, intracutaneous or intramuscular injections or preparations suitable for oral, nasal or rectal administration. The instant invention also relates to antibodies and antisera to natural LppQ, LppQ fragments, recombinant LppQ, or LppQ variants. Such antibodies and antisera are raised using standard vaccination regimes in appropriate hosts. The host is vaccinated with at least one antigen or vaccine of the present invention, with or without an adjuvant, to generate an immune response. The immune response may be monitored, for example, by measurement of the levels of antibodies produced, using standard ELISA methods. In a preferred embodiment, production of polyclonal antisera is carried out using cattle as host. The host is bled on a regular basis and the antibody fraction purified from the blood by standard means, e.g., by protein A or protein G chromatography. In an alternative embodiment, the host is a mouse, and monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas are prepared by standard means. See CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY, Coligan et al., (1991) ch. 2.5. Monoclonal antibodies are then prepared from the hybridoma cells by standard means. 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 16 The invention also relates to a diagnostic kit which contains the protein according to item A, B or C and preferably at least one of the antibodies as described above in suitable containers. Diagnostic kits for detection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC infestation are prepared by providing at least one of the antibodies prepared above, together with a positive control standard of a known concentration of the antigen of the present invention. In one embodiment, the antigen positive control is recombinant LppQ or LppQN'. The kit format conforms to a standard diagnostic format such as the ELISA format. Some aspects of the invention will now be explained in more detail with the aid of the Examples, without being restricted thereto. Example 1: Identification of LppQ In order to investigate the humoral and bronchial immune responses in cattle infected with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, sequentially collected sera and bronchial washes of cattle which were experimentally contact infected with African strain Afade or European strain L2 were analysed by immunoblotting (Abdo et al., 1998). Several common dominant immunogenic antigens with the molecular masses of 110, 95, 85, 80, 72, 62, 48 and 39 kDa were identified. The studies revealed - among other immune reactions - an early and persistent immune reaction to a protein of 48 kDa in both sera and bronchial lavages from cattle infected with either strain Afad6, the reference strain for the African cluster of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (Cheng et al., 1995), or strain L2, the reference strain for the European cluster (Cheng et al., 1995). Now it is shown by immunoblot analysis of antigens from the mycoplasmas which are genetically and antigenically most closely related to M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC using the same sera that the 48 kDa was specific to the species M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (Table 1). The 48 kDa antigen is therefore chosen as a candidate for a specific, predominant and persistent antigen for the present development of sero-detection of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and/or for the development of components of vaccines against CBPP. 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 17 Example 2: Identification and cloning of /ppQ gene The gene /ppQ encoding the lipoprotein LppQ was cloned by constructing a gene library made with Sau3AI digested genomic DNA of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC cloned in kZAP-express T M vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) followed by in vitro packaging and infecting compatible E. coli strain with the recombinant phages using the "Gigapack gold" packaging kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The phage plaques were screened with sera from cattle that were experimentally infected with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC strain Afad6 (Abdo et al., 1998) using a standard procedure for screening gene libraries (Ausbel et al., 1990). Several phage clones were transformed into phagmid clones using f1 helper phage according to the protocol of the producer of the kZAP-expressTM (Stratagene). The DNA sequences of several clones were determined using an ABI Prism model 310 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn. USA) and the DNA sequences assembly software Sequencher 3.0 (GeneCode, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) to obtain contiguous sequences. One clone, plasmid pJFFma5 showed an ORF encoding a characteristic lipoprotein of 48 kDa as determined by the parameters described (Hayashi 1990). The gene encoding 48 KDa lipoprotein was designated as /ppQ (Table 5). Example 3: Mutagenesis of the 9 codons in the lppQ gene In order to exchange Mycoplasma specific UGAtrp codons to the universal UGGtm codons, site directed mutagenesis of the IppQ gene, was performed by the method described by Urban et al. (1997), using oligonucleotide primers listed in Table 3 and the cloned /ppQ gene on plasmid pJFFma5 as a template. The mutagenised gene with the UGGtrp codons is refereed to as /ppQ* (Table 6). Example 4: Construction of the plasmids expressing poly-histidine tailed LppQ peptides WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 18 Plasmid pJFFmaLP48-MuHisl expressing poly-histidine tailed IppQ (named LppQ-His) was constructed as follows. The mutagenised lppQ* gene (Table 6) obtained as described above was used as a template for PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers P48EcoR1 and P48B7r (Table 3) and Pwo polymerase. The amplified gene was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion using EcoR1 and BamHl and subsequently ligated to the corresponding digested cloning/expression vector pETHIS 1. Plasmid pJFFLP48-11 expressing poly-histidine tailed N'-terminal half of LppQ, named LppQN'-His, was constructed as follows: The mutagenised IppQ* gene (Table 6) obtained as described above was used as a template for PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers MMMLP481 and MMMLP484 (Table 3) and Pwo polymerase. The amplified gene fragment /ppQ*N'(Table 8) was digested with restriction enzymes Ndel and BamHl and subsequently ligated to the corresponding cloning sites of expression vector pETHIS-1. Plasmid pJFFmaLppQ-Cterm expressing poly-histidine tailed C-terminal half of LppQ, named LppQC'-His was constructed as follows: the mutagenised IppQ* gene (Table 6) obtained as described above was used as a template for PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers P48B1f and P48B7r (Table 3) and Pwo polymerase. The amplified gene, named /ppQ*C'(Table 10) was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion using EcoRl and BamHl and subsequently ligated to the corresponding cloning sites of EcoR1 and BamHl digested expression vector pETHIS-1. Example 5: Expression of the poly-histidine tagged proteins in specialised E. coli For the expression of the three poly-histidine tailed LppQ-peptides, the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) was transformed with plasmids pJFFmaLP48-MuHisl, pJFFLP48-1 1, or pJFFmaLppQ-Cterm (Table 4). Expression and subsequent purification of the poly-histidine tailed peptides was obtained after induction of cell cultures at mid exponential growth phase with IPTG and purification using Ni 2 -chelation chromatography as described in detail by Braun et al. (1999). Example 6: Protocols of Immunoblots WO 01/40471 PCT/EPOO/11798 19 Immunoblots were done as described by Ausubel, et al. (1990). Serum or bronchial lavage fluid were used from the experimental infection as described (Abdo et al., 1998). Purified recombinant proteins (200pg/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (0.06 M Tris HCI pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% Glycerol, 2% p-mercaptoethanol, 0.025 % Bromphenol blue), and boiled for 5 min. The antigens were separated by SDS PAGE polyacrylamide gels using 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels, then blotted onto nitro-cellulose membrane with pore size of 0.2 tm (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked with milk buffer for 1 hour at room temperature (r.t.), dried, and cut into strips. The strips were incubated with the sera samples for 1 hour at r.t., and washed 3 times with TBS (100 mM Tris HCI pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) for 5 min. The strips were then incubated 1 hour at r.t. with alkaline phosphatase labelled conjugates, which were diluted in milk buffer. The conjugates used were a) Monoclonal antibody (Mab) anti bovine IgG (Sigma #A7554) diluted 1:5000, b) polyclonal Ab anti-rabbit or anti-mice IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry Gaithersberg, MD, USA) diluted 1:2000. All strips were washed 3 times with TBS buffer. Colour reaction was initiated by 0.3 mg/ml Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), 0.15 mg 5-bromo-4-chloro-3 indolyl phosphate (BCIP) (Boehringer Mannheim) in alkaline buffer, and stopped with distilled water. Example 7: Gene IppQ based PCR method as specific system for detection of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC A specific PCR method was developed which allowed the identification of the organism M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC based on the IppQ gene. The specific primers developed were MMMSCO5-7 and MMMSCO5-6 (Table 3). The specific PCR parameters are: denaturation 940C, 30 sec.; annealing 48'C, 30 sec.; elongation 720C, 1 min.; 35 cycles. This PCR amplified a specific 1304 bp fragment from all strains of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC tested which originated of world-wide most distant places (Table 1). No amplification were observed with the other related mycoplasmal organisms (Table 1) under the same conditions. 
 WO 01/40471 PCT/EPO0/11798 20 Example 8: Immunological detection systems Purified recombinant LppQN'-His (N-terminal peptide) was produced from strain JF1979 and purified subsequently by Ni-chelation chromatography (Figure 6). Purified LppQN' His was used to coat Microtiter plates. Coating was done by standard procedures (Nicolet and Martel 1996) using 100il of LppQ 10 ig/ml in carbonate coating buffer (0.1 M Na 2 
 CO 
 3 /NaHCO, pH 9.6). The coated Microtiter plates (containing 1 [ig LppQN' per well) were used to perform indirect ELISA on sera from several cattle including cattle with CBPP from different countries, sera from healthy cattle, sera from experimentally infected cattle and sera from healthy cattle including sera which gave false positive results with the standard CF test. The preliminary data from this ELISA are shown in Table 2. The data show that an ELISA test based on LppQN'-His is suitable for specific and sensitive serodiagnosis to detect animals with CBPP or animals that were infected with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC.
