    [0001]
     The invention relates to the use of bacterial strains to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and to promote animal health. 
   BACKGROUND 
   
    
    [0002]
     An animal's gastrointestinal tract is constantly challenged by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa found in feed, bedding, and the environment. The gastrointestinal tract counters these undesirable microbes using physical, chemical, and immunological defenses. These defenses also include beneficial microbes, such as bacteria, that are resident in the gastrointestinal tract. Pathogens, stress, metabolic upset, the use of antimicrobials, and other causes may upset the balance of the intestinal microbiome, which can affect digestion and can also make the animal more susceptible to disease. Providing the animal with beneficial bacteria that assist in the establishment or reestablishment of a healthy intestinal microbiome profile can help maintain healthy animals and maximize animal performance. 
   SUMMARY 
   
    
    [0003]
     Compositions and methods for controlling undesirable microbes are provided. Such compositions and methods comprise beneficial bacterial strains that control undesirable microbes, including pathogenic bacterial strains. Such pathogenic bacterial strains include one or more strains of  Salmonella  spp. and/or  Escherichia coli . The beneficial bacterial strains can be used as probiotics or direct-fed microbials (DFMs) for animals. The beneficial bacterial strains may also be used in the absence of disease to promote animal health and to establish or maintain a healthy intestinal microbiome profile. Also provided herein are methods for formulating and administering the beneficial bacterial strains to animals for improving animal health and performance and/or for treating or preventing disease caused by undesirable microbes in the gut.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
 I. Overview 
   
    
    [0007]
     Compositions and methods for controlling undesirable microbes are provided. The compositions and methods provided herein involve the use of beneficial bacterial strains that can control undesirable microbes, such as pathogenic bacteria, and can promote animal health. 
     
    
    [0008]
     Bacterial strains of the invention and variants thereof retain the ability to control one or more undesirable microbes and/or improve digestion of certain types of feed. In some embodiments, bacterial strains of the invention and variants thereof will retain the ability to control harmful, disease-causing, or pathogenic bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria includes pathogenic strains of  Clostridia  spp, (such as  C. perfringens  and  C. dificile )  Salmonella  spp (such as  S. enterica, S. arizonae, S. typhirium, S. enteritidis , and  S. bonglori ),  Listeria  spp. (such as  L. moncytogenes, L. seeligeri , and  L. welshimeri ),  Escherichia  spp, (such as  E. coli ),  Enterococci  spp. (such as  E. faecalis  and  E. bonglori ),  Staphylococci  spp. (such as  S. aureus ),  Aeromonas  spp,  Streptococci  spp,  Campylobacter  spp,  Haemophilus  spp,  Brachyspira  spp, and  Vibrio  spp. and the like. 
     
    
    [0009]
     The term “controlling” undesirable microbes refers to one or more of inhibiting or reducing the growth, feeding, reproduction, and/or proliferation of an undesirable microbe or its population, or killing (e.g., causing the morbidity or mortality, or reduced/stopped proliferation) of an undesirable microbe or its population. Without being bound by theory, the beneficial bacteria may be able to control the undesirable microbe by secretion of a toxic metabolite, or by out-competing and/or out-growing the undesirable microbe (“competitive exclusion”). Control may be by promotion of the growth of beneficial bacteria. In some embodiments, strains of the invention and variants thereof will retain the ability to control pathogenic bacteria. In further embodiments, strains of the invention and variants thereof will retain the ability to control  Salmonella  spp, and/or  Escherichia  spp. In some embodiments, pathogenic bacteria may be reduced by about 0.5 log, about 1 log, about 2 log, about 3 log, about 4 log, about 5 log, or more. 
     
    
    [0010]
     The beneficial bacterial strains of the invention may be utilized in products, such as probiotics, which aim to control undesirable microbes, including pathogenic bacteria. The term “probiotics” has been defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotics include beneficial bacteria. Direct-fed microbial (DFM) products are probiotic products that contain live, viable microorganisms, particularly beneficial bacteria, which deliver these bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract for colonization of the tract to improve the health and performance of the animal. DFMs influence the gut microbiome in a positive way by supporting the growth of beneficial microbes, such as beneficial bacteria, and/or by controlling undesirable microbes, such as pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, beneficial bacteria may promote animal health by acidifying the gut, thereby creating an environment that disfavors colonization by undesirable microbes, and/or may aid in the digestion of specific feed ingredients, for example dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), which is a high-protein livestock feed. Beneficial bacteria are also known to stimulate the immune system of the host animal. Further, beneficial bacteria may produce antimicrobial substances which can control undesirable microbes. Such antimicrobial substances include bacteriocins, lipopeptides such as iturins and surfactin, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetic and lactic acid.

    [0041]
     As used herein, “derived from” means directly isolated or obtained from a particular source or alternatively having identifying characteristics of a substance or organism isolated or obtained from a particular source. In the event that the “source” is an organism, “derived from” means that it may be isolated or obtained from the organism itself, as a fermentation product, or from the culture broth, suspension, or medium used to culture or grow said organism. A compound or composition “derived from” or “obtainable from” means that the compound or composition may be isolated from or produced by a cell culture or a whole cell broth, or suspension, filtrate, supernatant, fraction, or extract derived from a cell culture or a whole cell broth. 
     
    
    [0042]
     As used herein, “whole broth culture” or “whole cell broth” refers to a liquid culture containing both cells and media. If bacteria are grown on a plate, the cells can be harvested in water or other liquid, whole culture. The terms “whole broth culture” and “whole cell broth” are used interchangeably. 
     
    
    [0043]
     As used herein, “supernatant” refers to the liquid remaining when cells grown in broth or are harvested in another liquid from an agar plate and are removed by centrifugation, filtration, sedimentation, or other means well known in the art.

Active variants of the various bacterial strains provided herein include, for example, any isolate or mutant of AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, and AIP056374 that retain the ability to control one or more undesirable microbes and/or aid in the digestion of some types of feed. An active variant includes a strain having all of the identifying characteristics of the recited strain. A “strain of the invention” includes active variants thereof 
     
    
    [0057]
     The term “mutant” refers to a variant of the parental strain as well as methods for obtaining a mutant or variant in which the antimicrobial or digestive activity is greater than that expressed by the parental strain. The “parent strain” is the original strain before mutagenesis. To obtain such mutants the parental strain may be treated with a chemical such as N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, ethylmethanesulfone (EMS), or by irradiation using gamma, x-ray, or UV-irradiation, or by other means well known in the art. 
     
    
    [0058]
     In some embodiments, the active variant contains at least one mutation in at least one gene, relative to the deposited strain. The gene(s) may have a role in, for example, biofilm formation, motility, chemotaxis, extracellular secretion, transport (for example ABC transporter proteins), stress responses, volatiles, transcription (for example alternative sigma factors and global transcription regulators), gut colonization, ability to increase the growth of beneficial bacteria in an animal gut, and/or secondary metabolism including synthesis of lipopeptides, polyketides, macromolecular hydrolases (for example proteases and/or carbohydrases), and/or antimicrobial compounds including antibiotics. Secondary metabolism refers to both non-ribosomal and ribosomal synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, including cyclic lipopeptides, polyketides, iturins, bacteriocins (for example plantazolicin and amylocyclicin) and dipeptides (for example bacilysin). 
     
    
    [0059]
     Further active variants of the various bacteria provided herein can be identified by employing, for example, methods that determine the sequence identity relatedness between the 16S ribosomal RNA, methods to identify groups of derived and functionally identical or nearly identical strains include Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), concatenated shared genes trees, Whole Genome Alignment (WGA), Average Nucleotide Identity, and MinHash (Mash) distance metric. 
     
    
    [0060]
     In one aspect, the active variants of the bacterial strain AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, or AIP056374 include strains that are closely related to any of the disclosed strains by employing the Bishop MLST method of organism classification as defined in Bishop et al. (2009) BMC Biology 7(1)1741-7007-7-3. Thus, in specific embodiments, an active variant of a bacterial strain disclosed herein includes a bacterial strain that falls within at least an 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%. 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 98.5%, 98.8%, 99%, 99.1%, 99.2%, 99.3%, 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, or 99.9% sequence cut off employing the Bishop method of organism classification as set forth in Bishop et al. (2009)  BMC Biology  7(1)1741-7007-7-3, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Active variants of the bacteria identified by such methods will retain the ability to kill or control at least one undesirable microbe and/or to improve digestion when administered in an effective amount to an animal. 
     
    
    [0061]
     In another aspect, the active variant of the bacterial strain(s) disclosed herein include strains that are closely related to any of the disclosed strains on the basis of the Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) method of organism classification. ANI (see, for example, Konstantinidis, K. T., et al., (2005)  PNAS  USA 102(7):2567-72; and Richter, M., et al., (2009)  PNAS  106(45):19126-31) and variants (see, for example, Varghese, N.J., et al.,  Nucleic Acids Research  (Jul. 6, 2015): gkv657) are based on summarizing the average nucleotides shared between the genomes of strains that align in WGAs. Thus, in specific embodiments, an active variant of bacterial strain AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, and AIP056374 disclosed herein includes a bacterial strain that falls within at least a 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 97.5%, 98%, 98.5%, 98.8%, 99%, 99.5%, or 99.8% sequence cut off employing the ANI method of organism classification as set forth in Konstantinidis, K.T., et al., (2005)  PNAS  USA 102(7):2567-72, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Active variants of the bacteria identified by such methods will retain the ability to kill or control at least one undesirable microbe and/or to improve digestion when administered in an effective amount to an animal. 
     
    
    [0062]
     In another aspect, the active variants of the isolated bacterial strain(s) disclosed herein include strains) that are closely related to any of the above strains (for example, closely related to AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, or AIP056374) on the, basis of 16S rDNA sequence identity. See Stackebrandt. E. et al., “Report of the ad hoc committee for the re-evaluation of the species definition in bacteriology,”  Int J Syst Evol Microbiol  52(3):1043-7 (2002) regarding use of 16S rDNA sequence identity for determining relatedness in bacteria.

    [0063]
     The MinHash (Mash) distance metric is a comparison method that defines thresholds for hierarchical classification of microorganisms at high resolution and requires few parameters and steps (Ondov et al. (2016)  Genome Biology  17:132). The Mash distance estimates the mutation rate between two sequences directly from their MinHash sketches (Ondov et al. (2016) Genome Biology 17:132). Mash distance strongly corresponds to Average Nucleotide Identity method (ANI) for hierarchical classification (See, Konstantinidis, K. T. et al. (2005) PNAS USA 102(7):2567-72, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). That is, an ANI of 97% is approximately equal to a Mash distance of 0.03, such that values put forth as useful classification thresholds in the ANI literature can be directly applied with the Mash distance. 
     
    
    [0064]
     Active variants of the bacterial strain(s) disclosed herein include strains that are closely related to AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, or AIP056374 on the basis of the Minhash (Mash) distance between complete genome DNA sequences. Thus, in specific embodiments, an active variant of a bacterial strain disclosed herein includes bacterial strains having a genome within a Mash distance of less than about 0.015 to the disclosed strains. 
     
    
    [0065]
     In other embodiments, an active variant of a bacterial strain disclosed herein includes a distance metric of less than about 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, or 0.030. A genome, as it relates to the Mash distance includes both bacterial chromosomal DNA and bacterial plasmid DNA. In other embodiments, the active variant of a bacterial strain has a genome that is above a Mash distance threshold to the disclosed strains that is greater than dissimilarity caused by technical variance. In further instances, the active variant of a bacterial strain has a genome that is above a Mash distance threshold to the disclosed strains that is greater than dissimilarity caused by technical variance and has a Mash distance of less than about 0.015. In other instances, the active variant of a bacterial strain has a genome that is above a Mash distance threshold to the disclosed strains that is greater than dissimilarity caused by technical variance and has a Mash distance of less than about 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, or 0.030. 
     
    
    [0066]
     As used herein, “above technical variation” means above the Mash distance between two strains caused by errors in the genome assemblies provided the genomes being compared were each DNA sequenced with at least 20× coverage with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 DNA sequencing technology and the genomes are at least 99% complete with evidence for contamination of less than 2%. While 20× coverage is an art recognized term, for clarity, an example of 20× coverage is as follows: for a genome size of 5 megabases (MB), 100 MB of DNA sequencing from the given genome is required to have 20× sequencing coverage on average at each position along the genome. There are many suitable collections of marker genes to use for genome completeness calculations including the sets found in Campbell et al. (2013)  PNAS USA  110(14):5540-45, Dupont et al. (2012)  ISMEJ  6:1625-1628, and the CheckM framework (Parks et al. (2015)  Genome Research  25:1043-1055); each of these references is herein incorporated in their entirety. Contamination is defined as the percentage of typically single copy marker genes that are found in multiple copies in the given genome sequence (e.g. Parks et al. (2015) Genome Research 25:1043-1055); each of these references is herein incorporated in their entirety. Completeness and contamination are calculated using the same collection of marker genes. Unless otherwise stated, the set of collection markers employed in the completeness and contamination assay is those set forth in Campbell et al. (2013)  PNAS USA  110(14):5540-45, herein incorporated by reference. 
     
    
    [0067]
     Exemplary steps to obtain a distance estimate between the genomes in question are as follows: (1) Genomes of sufficient quality for comparison must be produced. A genome of sufficient quality is defined as a genome assembly created with enough DNA sequence to amount to at least 20× genome coverage using Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology. The genome must be at least 99% complete with contamination of less than 2% to be compared to the claimed microbe's genome. (2) Genomes are to be compared using the Minhash workflow as demonstrated in Ondov et al. (2016)  Genome Biology  17:132, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Unless otherwise stated, parameters employed are as follows: “sketch” size of 1000, and “k-mer length” of 21. (3) Confirm that the Mash distance between the two genomes is less than 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, 0.020, 0.025, or 0.030. Using the parameters and methods stated above, a Mash distance of 0.015 between two genomes means the expected mutation rate is 0.015 mutations per homologous position. Active variants of the bacteria identified by such methods will retain the ability to control at least one undesirable microbe, such as a pathogenic bacterium, and/or to improve digestion when administered in an effective amount to an animal.

    [0076]
     Compositions of the invention may also include prebiotics, which may be combined or mixed with a formulated bacterial strain of the invention into a feed or food composition, or into drinking water, for administration to an animal. Prebiotics are food ingredients that are not readily digestible by enzymes endogenous to the gut (such as those expressed by the animal or those expressed by the resident gut microbiome) and that selectively stimulate the growth and activity of selected groups of intestinal microorganisms that confer beneficial effects upon their host. Typically, it is beneficial microorganism populations that benefit from the presences of prebiotic compounds. Prebiotics can consist of oligosaccharides and other small molecules that serve as metabolic substrates for growth of beneficial microbes. Common prebiotics include galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin, isomalto-oligosaccharies, gentio-oligosaccharides, lactilol, lactosucrose, lactulose, xylosucrose, glycosylsucrose, pyrodextrins, soybean oligosaccharides, guar gum, locust bean gum, arabinan, galactan, pectins, and pectic polysaccharides. While many diverse microbes inhabit the intestinal tract of a host organism, prebiotic compounds are only utilized by the beneficial microbes and lead to a selective enhancement of the beneficial microbe population. A formulation that includes both prebiotics and probiotics may be known as a “synbiotic”.

     The viability of a bacterial strain, such as AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or active variant of any thereof, in a composition or formulation can be quantitated using an epifluorescence assay in which fluorescent dyes that are specific for cells with intact membranes or disrupted membranes are utilized, such as those assays that use a SYTO 9 nucleic acid stain that fluoresces green indicating a cell has an intact membrane and propidium iodide that fluoresces red indicating a cell with a disrupted membrane that is not viable (see, for example, LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability and Counting Kit from Molecular Probes; and Ivanova et al. (2010)  Biotechnology  & Biotechnological Equipment  24:supl, 567-570). It is known that following desiccation, some bacterial strains, such as for example certain  Pseudomonas  strains, enter a metabolically active state in which the cells are viable but not culturable (VBNC) (Pazos-Rojas et al. (2019)  PLoS ONE  14(7):e0219554). Cells in a VBNC state retain the ability to be cultured if reconstituted, for example, in water or root exudates, when exposed to particular metals or ions, or any other reconstitution method that is specific for the individual VBNC bacterial strain.

   B. Methods of Treating or Preventing Disease or Increasing Animal Health 
   
    
    [0090]
     It is known in the art that control of undesirable microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract of an animal by decreasing their ability to grow in the gut of an animal reduces incidence of disease caused by said microbes. Additionally, it is well-known that the administration of beneficial microbes, such as beneficial bacteria, can reduce the incidence of undesirable microbes in animals (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,063,836, incorporated by reference herein). It is also recognized that the consumption of exogenous bacteria, for example probiotics, can elicit beneficial effects upon a host. For example, in humans, consumption of probiotics has been shown to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and increase remission rates in adults with ulcerative colitis (Wilkins and Sequoia, American Family Physician (2017), 96(3): 170-179). 
     
    
    [0091]
     It is also well established that the addition of beneficial bacteria to animal feed, for example as probiotics, can improve animal efficiency and health. Healthy microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract of an animal are often associated with enhanced animal performance, reflecting more efficient digestion and improved immunity. Such improvements may be measured by the weight gain-to-feed intake ratio (feed efficiency), average daily weight gain, average daily feed intake, feed conversion in the animal and disease incidence (see, for example, Liao and Nychoti, Animal Nutrition (2017), 3: 331-343, herein incorporated in its entirety). For dairy cows, improvements may also be measured by milk yield or milk composition (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,529,793 and 5,534,271, incorporated by reference herein). Increased productivity in farm animals may be measured by production of more or higher quality eggs, milk, or meat, or increased production of weaned offspring. 
     
    
    [0092]
     Provided herein are methods for improving animal health and/or performance by providing an effective amount of at least one bacterial strain provided herein or combination of bacterial strains provided herein or an active variant thereof, and/or a composition derived therefrom, to the animal. A composition of the invention may increase animal health by improving or establishing a healthy microbial population in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal. This improvement can be determined by increased growth rate, increased average weight gain, higher feed intake, improved feed conversion ratio, higher feed conversion efficiency, and improved nutrient digestibility, all of which can be measured by one of skill in the art (see e.g., Liao and Nyachoti, (1997) Animal Nutrition 3: 331-343, and references cited therein). In some embodiments, the term “improvement of animal health” refers to the improvement in a diseased animal's physiological state. In some embodiments, an animal's health (e.g., growth rate, average weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, feed conversion efficiency, nutrient digestibility) can be improved by at least about 10%, about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14%, about 15%, about 16%, about 17%, about 18%, about 19%, about 20%, about 21%, about 22%, about 23%, about 24%, about 25%, about 26%, about 27%, about 28%, about 29%, about 30%, about 31%, about 32%, about 33%, about 34%, about 35%, about 36%, about 37%, about 38%, about 39%, about 40%, about 41%, about 42%, about 43%, about 44%, about 45%, about 46%, about 47%, about 48%, about 49%, about 50%, about 51%, about 52%, about 53%, about 54%, about 55%, about 56%, about 57%, about 58%, about 59%, about 60%, about 61%, about 62%, about 63%, about 64%, about 65%, about 66%, about 67%, about 68%, about 69%, about 70%, about 71%, about 72%, about 73%, about 74%, about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about 78%, about 79%, about 80%, about 81%, about 82%, about 83%, about 84%, about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%, about 89%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, about 100% or more when compared to non-treated control animals. 
     
    
    [0093]
     Also provided herein are methods for controlling undesirable microbes such as pathogenic bacteria, comprising providing to an animal an effective amount of at least one bacterial strain provided herein or an active variant thereof, and/or a composition derived therefrom wherein the bacterial strain and/or the composition derived therefrom controls the undesirable microbes (e.g., pathogenic bacteria).

    [0095]
     An animal treated with the bacterial strain or combination of bacterial strains provided herein or an active variant thereof may show a reduced severity or reduced development of disease in the presence of pathogenic bacteria by a statistically significant amount. A reduced severity or reduced development of disease or damage can be a reduction of about 10% to about 20%, about 20% to about 30%, about 30% to about 40%, about 40% to about 50%, about 50% to about 60%, about 60% to about 70%, about 70% to about 80%, about 80% to about 90%, or about 90% to about 100% when compared to non-treated control animals. In other instances, the animal treated with a bacterial strain provided herein or an active variant thereof may show a reduced severity or reduced development of disease in the presence of a pathogenic bacteria of at least about 10%, about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14%, about 15%, about 16%, about 17%, about 18%, about 19%, about 20%, about 21%, about 22%, about 23%, about 24%, about 25%, about 26%, about 27%, about 28%, about 29%, about 30%, about 31%, about 32%, about 33%, about 34%, about 35%, about 36%, about 37%, about 38%, about 39%, about 40%, about 41%, about 42%, about 43%, about 44%, about 45%, about 46%, about 47%, about 48%, about 49%, about 50%, about 51%, about 52%, about 53%, about 54%, about 55%, about 56%, about 57%, about 58%, about 59%, about 60%, about 61%, about 62%, about 63%, about 64%, about 65%, about 66%, about 67%, about 68%, about 69%, about 70%, about 71%, about 72%, about 73%, about 74%, about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about 78%, about 79%, about 80%, about 81%, about 82%, about 83%, about 84%, about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%, about 89%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or about 100% or about 10-20%, about 20-30%, about 10-50%, about 30-40%, about 40-50%, about 50-60%, about 60-70%, about 70-80%, about 80-90%, about 90-99%, about 25-50%, about 50-75%, about 75-99% greater when compared to non-treated control animals. Methods for assessing animal disease severity are known, and include reductions of any symptom of the disease including but not limited to diarrhea incidence (such as for example the rate of post-weaning diarrhea in mammalian farm animals), mortality (such as for example pre- or post-weaning mortality in mammalian farm animals), weight loss, reduction of growth rate, reduction of milk production, inflammation, loss of pregnancy, skin lesions, coughing, sneezing, diarrhea, increased body temperature, or a combination thereof 
     
    
    [0096]
     In specific embodiments, the bacterial strains, active variants thereof, and/or a composition derived therefrom provided herein reduce the disease or disease symptoms resulting from a pathogenic bacteria or other undesirable microbe by a statistically significant amount, including for example, at least about 10% to at least about 20%, at least about 20% to about 50%, at least about 10% to about 60%, at least about 30% to about 70%, at least about 40% to about 80%, or at least about 50% to about 90% or greater. Hence, the methods of the invention can be utilized to protect animals from disease or disease symptoms caused by undesirable microbes including pathogenic bacteria. 
     
    
    [0097]
     The term “treat” or “treating” or its derivatives includes substantially inhibiting, slowing, or reversing the progression of a condition, substantially ameliorating symptoms of a condition or substantially preventing the appearance of symptoms or conditions brought about by the pathogenic bacteria. In specific embodiments, treating a condition comprises reducing the severity or delaying the onset of at least one symptom of the condition. 
     
    
    [0098]
     In particular embodiments, “controlling” and “protecting” an animal from an undesirable microbe refers to one or more of inhibiting or reducing the growth, germination, reproduction, and/or proliferation of an undesirable microbe; and/or killing, removing, destroying, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence, and/or activity of an undesirable microbe. As such, an animal treated with the bacterial strain provided herein, a variant thereof, and/or a composition derived therefrom may show a reduced severity or reduced development of disease in the presence of an undesirable microbe by a statistically significant amount. Alternatively, the animal treated with a bacterial strain provided herein, a variant thereof, and/or a composition derived therefrom may exhibit increased signs of animal healthiness. Signs of healthiness include improvements in animal performance, which may be measured by the weight gain-to-feed intake ratio (feed efficiency), average daily weight gain, average daily feed intake, feed conversion in the animal and disease incidence. Signs of healthiness also include reduction of mortality within a population of animals. 
     
    
    [0099]
     The term “prevent” and its variations means the countering in advance of pathogenic microbe infection, growth, or proliferation. In some embodiments, the composition is applied before exposure to pathogenic bacteria. The term “inhibit” and all variations of this term is intended to encompass the restriction or prohibition of infection, growth, and/or proliferation by a pathogenic microbe, for example pathogenic bacteria. 
     
    
    [0100]
     The terms “delay”, “retard” and all variations thereof are intended to encompass the slowing of the progress of infection, growth, and/or proliferation by a pathogenic microbe. The expression “delaying the onset” is interpreted as preventing or slowing the progression of infection, growth, and/or proliferation of a pathogenic microbe for a period of time, such that said pathogenic microbe infection, growth, and/or proliferation do not progress as far along in development, or appear later than in the absence of the treatment according to the invention. 
     
    
    [0101]
     The terms “ameliorate” and “amelioration” relate to the improvement in the treated animal condition brought about by the compositions and methods provided herein. 
     
    
    [0102]
     Administration of the strains of the invention or variants thereof or compositions derived therefrom may also be used to restore or maintain intestinal microbial balance before, during, or after administration of therapeutic amounts of antibiotics by inhibiting growth of pathogenic microbes and/or increasing or maintaining growth of beneficial microbes. In some embodiments, “therapeutic amount” refers to an amount sufficient to ameliorate or reverse a disease state in an animal. 
     
    
    [0103]
     Compositions of the invention can be administered to an animal in a multitude of ways well-known in the art. Most typically, compositions of the invention are provided to the animal orally, as a feed additive or probiotic. In some embodiments, a composition of the invention is added to animal feed, either prior to the pelleting process, so that the composition is part of the animal feed formulation, or after the pelleting process, so that the composition is added to the feed separately but prior to providing to the animal. In other embodiments, compositions of the invention are added to the drinking water that is provided to the animal. In other embodiments, compositions of the invention are provided to the animal through means other than oral administration. In some embodiments, compositions of the invention are administered to an animal as an injection. In other embodiments, compositions of the invention are administered to an animal as a topical application. In some embodiments, compositions of the inventions may be added to rearing waters, as in the case of aquatic animals, so that the animals are exposed to compositions of the invention in their aquatic environments. 
     
    
    [0104]
     The compositions and methods of the invention may be provided and/or administered to any animal, including vertebrates such as mammals (including humans), reptiles, birds, and aquatic animals including fish and crustaceans.

   EXAMPLES 
 Example 1: Selection of Bacterial Strains 
   
    
    [0194]
     The bacterial strains of the invention were selected based on a number of criteria, including genomic profiling, antagonistic activity against  S. enterica  and also against a spectrum of virulent  E. coli  strains, acid and heat tolerance of the bacteria, acidification, lactic acid production, and ability to thrive and sporulate in selected media. To satisfy the majority of these criteria, bacterial strains had to be evaluated empirically, as described in the examples below. It could not be predicted, based either on taxonomy or genomic profiling of a given strain, how well it would perform in the empirical assays. Of over 1,500 bacterial strains initially evaluated empirically, 24 strains were determined to possess the desired combination of characteristics. These 24 strains are identified in Table 1 below and are characterized in the following examples.

   Example 2: Bioinformatic Analysis of Bacterial Strains 
   
    
    [0195]
     Genomes of over 80,000 bacterial strains were profiled by bioinformatic analysis. Bioinformatic analysis based on the AMR Finder Plus tool available at NCBI identified genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Any strains containing transmissible AMR genes, where the AMR gene was located on a plasmid or a transposon, were not elected for further consideration. Bioinformatic analysis also revealed the presence of desirable genomic features, such as biosynthetic gene clusters encoding for lichenysin, fengycin, or bacilysin. Other desirable genomic attributes included genes encoding for the biosynthetic production of short chain fatty acids, which are produced by the microbiota and contribute to gut health; genes encoding for carbohydrate-active enzymes; genes encoding for the ability to produce spores; and genes encoding for phytases, xylanases, lipases, amylases, and/or beta-glucanases, all of which may help with feed conversion. 
   Example 3: Bacterial Strains have Antagonistic Activity Against Undesirable Microbes 
   
    
    [0196]
     Based on the results of the bioinformatic screen, about 1,500 bacterial strains were selected to empirically assay for antagonistic activity against undesirable microbes. Bioinformatic analysis is not predictive of the performance of any given strain in the antagonism assays. Antagonistic activity against pathogenic strains of  Escherichia coli  and  Salmonella enterica  was determined using a method based on the agar diffusion assay of Burkholder et al. (1966). Two antagonism assays were performed. In the first, bacterial strains of interested were assayed for antagonistic activity against  E. coli  strain MG1655 (ATCC Deposit No. 700926) and S. enterica strain LT2 (ATCC Deposit No. 19585). The first antagonism assay indicated if a bacterial strain of interest was antagonistic against multiple genera of pathogenic bacteria. The second antagonism assay was performed against  E. coli  strain MG1655 and other  E. coli  strains which are known to be pathogenic on pigs. This second assay indicated if a bacterial strain of interest was antagonistic against a diverse range of pathogenic  E. coli  strains. 
     
    
    [0197]
     Briefly, a pathogenic strain was embedded in 1% Mueller-Hinton agar medium in an ANSI footprint plate. The medium also contained 0.2% bromocresol purple to report a pH reduction. Bacterial strains were individually spotted at least 3 mm apart onto the medium and incubated at 39° C. for 48 hours. Each bacterial strain was scored for activity based on factors including colony size, colony morphology, lysis zone formation, inhibitory zone formation, and pH depression. Colony size is defined as the colony surface area of each strain growing on the agar medium containing the embedded pathogen strain. Lysis zone and inhibitory zone refer to zones of clearing that contain lysed pathogen cells or are entirely free of pathogen cells, respectively. The development of a yellow color around a test colony indicates a reduction in pH. Results for the bacterial strains of the invention are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Activity is indicated qualitatively as a “Yes” or “No” . The  E. coli  strain MG1655 and  S. enterica  strain LT2 are indicated. The pathogenic  E. coli  strains are indicated as “strain 1P”, “strain 2P”, etc.

   Example 4: Acid and Heat Tolerance Assay 
   
    
    [0198]
     Bacterial strains were inoculated into wells of a 96-well plate containing 800 μl unbuffered Mueller-Hinton Broth (uMHB) and grown at 30° C. with mild agitation for at least 48 hrs. Each strain was represented twice in a single 96-well plate. To induce sporulation, the 96-well plate was placed at 4° C. for at least 48 hours. 
     
    
    [0199]
     A sample of each sporulated strain culture was transferred to a fresh 96-well plate (the “heat plate”) and incubated at 80° C. for 20 minutes. After allowing the plate to cool, half the volume of each heat-treated sample was transferred to a 96-well plate (the “acid plate”) in the presence of the strong acid HCl. Following incubation at room temperature, the sample was neutralized with NaOH and the dilution to extinction method was used to identify cultures that remained viable and capable of robust growth at 39° C. for 48 hours. The scattered light (AU) reading was then measured to determine growth for each sample and compared to a negative control. The assay described above was repeated three times for each strain. All strains disclosed herein consistently exhibited vigorous or robust growth at 39° C. after 48 hours and were considered to have acid and heat tolerance. 
   Example 5: Acidification and Lactic Acid Production 
   
    
    [0200]
     A BioLector® Pro (m2p-labs, Inc. Hauppauge, N.Y.) was used to determine acid production by a bacterial strain of interest as it grew over 24 hours. Bacterial strains were cultured in a selected media suitable for growing in large fermentation cultures and evaluated for 24 hours of growth in the BioLector®, during which time the pH of the media was measured following manufacturer's procotols. Strains were considered to have acidified the media if the pH of the media decreased during the 24 hours, especially if the pH reached the 5.0-6.0 range. 
     
    
    [0201]
     The lactic acid production of bacterial strains of interest was determined using a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) 2900 (YSI; Yellow Springs, Ohio) to measure lactate concentration (g/L) following manufacturer's protocols. 
   Example 6. Methods of Culturing 
   
    
    [0202]
     A bacterial strain of interest was cultured in liquid media similar to that described in Example 5. The table below summarizes the incubation time, the concentration of bacteria achieved and percentage of sporulation. The concentration of bacteria was determined by measuring maximal (max) scattered light readings and correlating those values with optical density (O D 600 ). This was performed for two biological replicates and the average was determined. The percentage of sporulation was determined by averaging the sporulation percentage of two biological replicates.

   Example 7:  Bacillus  Antagonism Assay 
   
    
    [0203]
     In some embodiments of the invention, the strains disclosed herein may be present in a composition as or used in a method as a combination, which comprises more than strain. Selected strains of the invention were evaluated to determine if growing them together affected their individual growth rate compared to growing them individually. To determine this, an antagonism assay similar to that described in Example 3 was performed. For these antagonism assays, a liquid culture of a disclosed strain was embedded into the assay medium, and selected strains were arrayed on the embedded agar. Zones of inhibition were scored on a 0 to 3 scale. The assay was performed three times and zones of inhibition were averaged, as shown in Table 5 below. The average antagonism score was calculated based on the zones of inhibition for all assayed strains and normalized to 1, where strain AIP033189, which had the highest zones of inhibition, has a value of 1 and strain AIP006035, which had zero for zones of inhibition, has a value of 0. Strains AIP004634, AIP087760, and AIP033189 have the highest average antagonism scores, suggesting that these three strains may impact the growth of other strains when cultured together. Strains AIP004816, AIP053802, and AIP006035 have the lowest average antagonism scores, indicating these three strains are likely to grow well in culture together and/or with many of the other strains disclosed herein.

   Example 8: Combination Colony Antagonism Assay 
   
    
    [0204]
     Pairwise combinations of selected strains of the invention were assayed to determine combined antagonistic effect on pathogenic  E. coli and S. enterica . This combination antagonism assay was similar to that described in Example 3, with the pathogenic  E. coli  or  S. enterica  embedded in the agar. For these antagonism assays, each of the two selected strains were cultured individually and mixed immediately before spotting on the surface of the agar. Each pairwise combination of strains, along with controls of each strain individually, was evaluated against three strains of  E. coli  described in Example 3 and the LT2 strain of  S. enterica . Each combination colony and control single colony was evaluated by the size and clarity of the zone of inhibition. The size of each combination colony was also noted. The clearing size of the zone of inhibition for the combination colony was compared to that of the strain combined with itself, and calls were made determining if the combination colony performed better, the same, or worse than the individual strain, where the strain combined with itself was given a value of 1.00. Results are provided in Table 6 below. The following pairwise combinations showed larger clearing sizes compared to each strain alone: AIP004816 and AIP053802; AIP004816 and AIP097873; AIP004816 and AIP012656; AIP053802 and AIP087760; AIP006035 and AIP097873. The combination colonies that contained AIP088262 were unusual in that they tended to grow so large that a zone of inhibition was not visible.

   Example 9: Zinc, Copper, and Tylosin Compatibility 
   
    
    [0205]
     The relative compatibility of selected strains of the invention with common feed additives, namely Zinc (ZnSO 4 ), Copper (CuSO 4 ), Tylosin, and a mixture of all three, was determined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each compound was determined by growing each strain in a gradient concentration of the compound. A similar experiment was performed with a mixture of all three (ZnCuTy). This experiment was performed three times, independently, and the geometric mean of each MIC is shown in parts per million in Table 7 below. The ZnCuTy mixture is reported as the concentration of zinc. A higher value indicates a higher concentration of the compound was required to prevent growth of the assayed strain.

   Example 10: Nursery Pig Feeding Trial 
   
    
    [0206]
     A pig feeding trial is conducted to assess the effects of a direct-fed microbial (DFM) feed additive comprising a bacterial strain described herein, namely AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, on body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency of nursery pigs. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 10,357,046, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Mixed-sex pens of pigs (PIC 337×C29) with a starting weight of 13.9±2.3 lb are sorted by weight into replicates based on body weight to create 12 replicates of 23-26 mixed-sex pigs/pen (6.7 ft2/pig stocking density). Each pen has a 3-space dry box feeder and 2 swinging water nipples. Pens are then randomly allotted a dietary treatment and immediately started on the study. Pens remain on dietary treatments until the end of the experimental period. Diets are formulated to meet or exceed NRC (1988) requirements. For the diets comprising a DFM comprising AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or a combination thereof, the strain(s) is added to the diet at 7.3×10 7  CFU/kg feed and supplied approximately 1×10 8  CFU/head/day based on average daily feed intake (ADFI). 
     
    
    [0207]
     The trial is run from weaning to six weeks post-weaning. Total pen weights are recorded at allotment of the experiment and at regular intervals during the experimental period. Period feed intakes corresponded with pen weight periods. Pen weights, feed delivered, and feed-in-feeder for each pen are used to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G ratio. All morbidity and mortality is recorded, along with any major health issues. 
     
    
    [0208]
     Each experiment is statistically analyzed individually. Initial data analysis is performed for all metrics to determine normality of distribution and outliers (±>3 standard deviations in difference from the grand mean) using the Univariate procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). Body weights and cumulative growth rates, feed intakes, and feed/gain ratios are analyzed according to randomized complete-block designs using the Mixed procedure of SAS, with the main effect of diet and random effect of replicate. Serial body weights, growth rates, feed intakes, and feed/gain ratios are analyzed similarly, with week or period included as a repeated measure. Morbidity, mortality, and other health-related metrics are analyzed as nonparametric data using the NParlway procedure of SAS. 
   Example 11: Grower-Finisher Pig Feeding Trial 
   
    
    [0209]
     A pig feeding trial is conducted to assess the effects of a DFM feed additive comprising a bacterial strain described herein, namely AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, on body weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency of grower-finisher pigs. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 9,089,151, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Approximately 180 pigs (Monsanto Choice Genetics GPK 35 females mated to EB Ultra sires) are blocked into three weight blocks by initial body weight and penned in groups of 5 pigs/pen at the completion of the nursery period. Pigs are moved to a wean-to-finish facility and housed 5 pigs/pen in totally slatted pens (1.52 m×3.05 m) equipped a single-hole feeder, and wean-to-finish cup waterers. Initial minimum ambient room temperature is maintained at approximately 78° F. During the finishing phase, minimum temperature is further reduced to 70° F. Feed and water are available freely throughout the study. 
     
    
    [0210]
     One of two dietary treatments are assigned to each pen (18 pens/treatment) within each block, and administered during Phase 1 (50 to 90 lbs), Phase 2 (90 to 130 lbs), Phase 3 (130 to 180 lbs), Phase 4 (180 to 230 lbs) and Phase 5 (230 lbs to market at approximately 270 lbs). The two dietary treatments consist of a basal control diet devoid of a DFM comprising a bacterial strain described herein, and the basal diet with a DFM comprising a bacterial strain described herein, in a five phase grower-finisher pig study. Diets are formulated to meet or exceed NRC (1988) requirements and consisted predominately of corn, soybean meal, and DDGS at 47%, 18.6%, and 30% of the diet, respectively. For the diets comprising a DFM comprising AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, the strain(s) is added to the diet at 7.3×10 7  CFU/kg feed and supplied approximately 1×10 8  CFU/head/day based on average daily feed intake (ADFI). Data collected are average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and feed required per unit of gain during each of the five growing-finishing phases. Pigs are removed from the study when the average pig weight of the entire barn reaches approximately 270 lbs. 
     
    
    [0211]
     Performance data are analyzed as a randomized complete block design with pen as the experimental unit and blocks based on initial body weight. Analysis of variance is performed using the GLM procedures of SAS. 
   Example 12: Broiler Chicken Feeding Trials 
   
    
    [0212]
     A boiler chicken feeding trial is conducted to assess the effects of DFM feed additive comprising a bacterial strain described herein, namely AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, on weight gain, caloric efficiency, and survivability of broiler chickens. See for example U.S. Publication 2017/0079308, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Approximately 2100 hatch rooster chickens ( Cobb  500 genetics) were evaluated up to 7 weeks of age. For this investigation, a total of 60 pens (6×6 ft, 35 ft2/pen—subtracting 1 sq ft for feeder space) were utilized, with a group size of 35 birds per pen. The pens were equipped with a dry tube feeder (30-lb feed capacity) with a total feeder space of 50 in. (1.7 in./bird) and 5 nipple drinkers/pen (7 birds/nipple). Birds were assigned to pen based on day old chick weight. Initial pen weight of all replicate pens have a maximum of range of 30 grams. Pens were then randomly allotted to dietary treatment from within replicate and immediately started on the study. Pens remained on dietary treatments until the end of the experiment. 
     
    
    [0213]
     Dietary treatments consist of a basal control diet devoid of a DFM comprising a bacterial strain described herein, and the basal diet with a DFM comprising a bacterial strain described herein. Basal control diet comprises yellow-dent corn, soybean meal, corn low-oil DDGS, and porcine meat and bone meal (Producers Cooperative, Bryan, Tex.) and poultry fat (Griffin Industries). All diets were formulated to be adequate in SID Lys (%, NRC, 1994) and the other essential AA, available P, and Ca. For the diets comprising a DFM comprising AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, the strain(s) is added to the diet at 7.3 x10 8  CFU/g feed. The DFM test materials were supplemented to the final diets at the expense of corn. Diet components were mixed in a horizontal mixer. Each diet was pelleted at 185° F. following 30 s of conditioning. The diets for weeks 1-2 were crumbled following pelleting. In the starter phase, the pellet stability of the DFM formulation was determined. The samples were obtained as follows and sent for analysis: A 2-lb sample of Mash was obtained at the start and 5 samples (1-lb per sample) of pelleted feed were obtained during the course of each pelleting run for each DFM-containing treatment. Samples of pelleted feed were collected following a brief acclimation in each new pelleting run and 1.0 lb from each 2.0 lb sample combined to form a pooled sample for each treatment. Pelleted feed samples were allowed to cool to room temperature before they were sealed for shipping. Both Mash & Pelleted feed samples were sent for analysis. Each feedstuff was sampled for nutrient and mycotoxin analyses at each point of manufacturing of experimental diets, and final experimental diets were sampled. 
     
    
    [0214]
     To determine the effects of the DFM feed additive comprising a bacterial strain described herein, total pen weights are determined at the start. Pen weight, feed disappearance, and caloric efficiency (kcal/lb gain) are determined at 2,4, 6, and 7 weeks post-hatching. The feed/gain ratio is adjusted for mortality by the following equation: Total feed consumed/(pen weight gain+mortality weight). Morbidity and mortality were also determined. 
     
    
    [0215]
     For carcass performance, A subset of each replicate-pen was processed for the determination of carcass, fat pad, and breast meat yield. Six broilers per replicate pen were randomly selected for yield determination. Growth and carcass data was analyzed using a randomized complete-block design, live weight (by pen) as the replication factor, and 10 replicates. 
     
    
    [0216]
     Statistical Procedures were carried out as follows: Prior to analysis, all data was checked for outliers. Any observation >3 standard deviations in difference from the grand mean for that metric was removed from the dataset. Cumulative body weight, growth, carcass, and economic performance were analyzed as a RCBD with six (6) treatments and 10 replicates. Morbidity, mortality, and other health-related metrics were analyzed as non-parametric data. Data were subjected to a one-way ANOVA and separated using Fisher's LSD. 
   Example 13: Calf Feeding Trial 
   
    
    [0217]
     A calf feeding trial is conducted to assess the effects of a DFM feed additive comprising a bacterial strain described herein, namely AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, on body weight gain and presence of pathogenic microbes within the calves. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 8,540,981, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The trial is conducted in a 120 stall mechanically ventilated veal production facility, with 120 sale barn sourced Holstein bull calves randomly and equally placed in treatment and control groups. Individual scale weights are measured at the start of the feeding trial and all calves in even-numbered stalls receive 1 gram (1×10 9  CFU) of the bacteria strains described herein, namely AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, in the morning milk feeding and each feeding thereafter for a total dose of 2×10 9  CFU/animal/day. The every-other-calf study design eliminates variability in calf placement, ventilation or grower feeding practices. All calves start directly on milk replacer at placement (w/o the direct-fed microbial). The calves are started on 6.4 oz (3 lbs solution) per calf per feeding of a 20:20, all milk formula (Anderson Calf Milk 20:20 non-medicated milk replacer with BioMos 3.4 grams/day at 10 oz feeding rate). Feeding rate increases approximately 0.5 oz daily over a 10 day period to a maximum of 10 oz milk replacer per feeding (5 lbs solution). The 10 oz feeding rate is continued through 53 days when feeding rate is reduced to once a day. Calves are fully weaned at 55 days. Milk replacer is mixed with hot water and fed at approximately 5:30 AM and 5:00 PM each day. The grower is provided with individual, foil, heat-sealed pouches that contained 60 grams of the direct-fed microbial, which is a water-soluble formulation containing 1 billion CFU/g of carrier, which may comprise bakers sugar, dextrose and/or baylith. With the exception of addition of the DFM feed additive, milk solutions are identical for the group receiving the DFM and the control group throughout the trial. 
     
    
    [0218]
     Calves are individually ear tagged with corresponding stall number upon placement. Twenty pairs (40 calves) are selected for collection of fecal swabs. Swabs are collected on all 40 calves at day 6, 8 (peak scours) and 15 in the trial. Pairs of calves are selected to be evenly dispersed throughout the room; in each pair one is a treatment and a control calf. Swabs are screened and the presence of pathogenic organisms  Clostridium perfringens  type A, B, C & D,  Salmonella  spp., and/or virulent strains of  E. coli  is determined using multiplex PCR analysis. Blood samples from the same 40 calves are drawn at day 6 of the trial using serum separator tubes. Samples are analyzed for total protein by a recognized industry expert regarding calf immunology. The weights of all calves are determined at the start of the study, at day 21, and at day 52. All treatments, feed refusals, and death losses are recorded. 
   Example 14: Dairy Cow Feeding Trial

     A dairy cow feeding trial is conducted to assess the effects of a DFM feed additive comprising a bacterial strain described herein, namely AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, on cow health, milk production, and reproduction parameters on dairy cows. See for example U.S. Publication 2015/0216916, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The trial is conducted on a herd of dairy cows ranging in size from 600 to 800 cows. 
     Milk production, reproduction, and health metrics are monitored on the entire herd via Dairy Comp 305 (Valley Agricultural Software, Tulare, Calif.) with a period of 3 months pre-DFM feed additive serving as the baseline. The entire herd is then monitored for milk production, milk components, health, and reproductive performance for 10 months during which cows received daily DFM feed additive, measuring weekly individual cow milk production, monthly DHIA milk components, and monthly health events. During the Bacillus supplementation period, cows received 15 grams of the Bacillus product daily to provide 7.35×10 9  CFU per head per day of live AIP088262, AIP068104, AIP016597, AIP004816, AIP053802, AIP004634, AIP006035, AIP029002, AIP066414, AIP093093, AIP022568, AIP032005, AIP012656, AIP002364, AIP044543, AIP090377, AIP048352, AIP089343, AIP007305, AIP033189, AIP063641, AIP087760, AIP097873, AIP056374, or an active variant of any thereof, or a combination thereof, within a standard corn silage and alfalfa hay-based total mixed ration. Reproductive metrics are evaluated during a 6-month period over consecutive years, during which pre-DFM feed additive is compared to post-DFM feed additive supplementation to control for seasonal variation. 
     
    
    [0220]
     Production and component data are analyzed by the MIXED procedure of SAS looking for fixed effects of treatment and the interaction of treatment*month*year, using days in milk (DIM) as covariate. Health and reproductive metrics are evaluated by the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. Significance between means is defined at p≤0.05 and trends are indicated when p≤0.1. 
   Example 15: In Vivo Evaluation of  Bacillus  Strains 
   
    
    [0221]
     Three proof of principle (POP) animal trials, POP 1, POP2 and POP3 were conducted for in vivo evaluation of  Bacillus  strains described herein. Fifteen  Bacillus  strains that were evaluated in the POP 1, POP2 and POP3 studies were AIP053802, AIP006035, AIP088262, AIP004816, AIP004634, AIP022568, AIP087760, AIP093093, AIP012656, AIP032005, AIP066414, AIP033189, AIP016597, AIP097873, and AIP044543. Each experiment consisted of seven treatments. These treatments included five  Bacillus  strains tested individually, an untreated negative control, and a positive control that received conventional antimicrobial feed additives (zinc oxide, copper sulphate, and tylosin). For the POP 1 study, each treatment had eight pens with five pigs per pen. For POP2 and POP3 studies, each treatment had seven pens with five pigs per pen. 
     
    
    [0222]
     Weaned piglets, approximately 21 days of age, were sourced from a local herd with a history of  E. coli -associated post-weaning diarrhea. Pigs were randomly assigned to treatment groups, while balancing for sex within each treatment. Pigs were fed a mash diet in three dietary phases; Phase 1 (study  days  0 to 7), Phase 2 (study days 7 to 21), and Phase 3 (study days 21 to 42). 
     
    
    [0223]
     The test article was prepared by growing each strain in a shake flask, inducing sporulation, concentrating, and spraying onto a ground rice hull carrier. The spores were mixed into the feed to a final concentration of 10 5  colony forming units (CFU) per gram of feed. 
     
    
    [0224]
     Growth performance was measured for individual pigs and by pen. The key performance metrics were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed efficiency measured by the ratio of gain to feed (G:F). Individual ADFI was calculated according to the procedure from Lee et al. ( Asian - Australas J Anim Sci.  2016; 29(12): 1756-1760). Growth performance, as measured in POP1, POP2, and POP3 studies, is provided in  FIGS.  1 ,  2 , and  3   , respectively. A summary of the growth performance is provided in Table 8 below.

     The level of post-weaning diarrhea challenge was assessed by fecal  E. coli  CFU counts. The effect of treatment on performance variables was assessed using a two-tail t-test between each treatment and the negative control group. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare  E. coli  CFU counts between each treatment and the negative control. P-values less than 0.1 were considered statistically significant. Next, the efficacy of the strains was ranked based on the growth performance and  E. coli  CFU counts. A summary of strain efficacy, as determined from POP1, POP2, and POP3 studies, is provided in Table 9 below.
