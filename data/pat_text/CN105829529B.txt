Method, the isolated polypeptide is resistant to the feedback inhibition of methionine and has homoserine O- succinyltransferase
Activity. 
 
 
 Background technique 
 Most of microbe present in known nature is made using o-succinyl homoserine or O-acetylhomoserine
Biosynthesis methionine is used for for intermediate.In general, by the succinyl group of succinyl-coenzyme A is conjugated to homoserine
Homoserine O- succinyltransferase (MetA) produce o-succinyl homoserine, and by by the acetyl group of acetyl coenzyme A
It is conjugated to homoserine O- transacetylase (MetX) the production O-acetylhomoserine of homoserine.That is, raw between intermediate
It produces in o-succinyl homoserine, metA is one of most important gene in the development of microorganism for producing it.Meanwhile with
MetA is different, and MetX is known as not by feedback inhibition and has high enzyme stability.

 Embodiment 4: the building of the parental plant based on wild type 
 
 (1) enhancing of ppc, aspC and asd gene 
 Escherichia coli W3110 (accession number: ATCC 9637) conversion purchased from American Type Culture Collecti (ATCC) has in reality
PSG76c-2ppc, pSG76c-2aspC, pSG76c-2asd carrier prepared in a 3-5 is applied, by its plating in LB-Cm
The training of (yeast extract of 10g/L, the tryptone of NaCl, 10g/L of 5g/L, the chloramphenicol of 25 μ g/L and the agar of 15g/L) plate
It supports on base, and selects the bacterium colony for showing resistance to chloramphenicol.The transformant of selection is that wherein pSG76c-2ppc carrier is inserted first
Enter the bacterial strain of the part ppc of genome. 
 Conversion has expression I-SceI's to the bacterial strain --- wherein inserting 2 copies of ppc gene --- so obtained
PST76-AsceP carrier, the I-SceI are the restriction enzymes for digesting the part I-SceI present in pSG76c carrier, and by its
Plating LB-Ap (yeast extract of 10g/L, the tryptone of NaCl, 10g/L of 5g/L, 100 μ g/L ampicillin
With the agar of 15g/L) on plating medium, and select the bacterial strain grown at 30 DEG C. 
 The bacterial strain so grown may be at following state: wherein ppc gene be amplified with have 2 copy or can be extensive
Again to have single copy.It is solidifying in 1% agarose after carrying out PCR using the primer of SEQ ID NO:30 and SEQ ID NO:31
The bacterial strain of 2 copies with ppc gene of the gene size of the increase with 6.5kb is selected in gel electrophoresis.As above-mentioned mistake
Journey as a result, remove pSG76c carrier while, ppc gene becomes to be further inserted into. 
 According to method described above, continuously being constructed using pSG76c-2aspC and pSG76c-2asd carrier is had

 (2) flask culture experiment 
 Then, flask test is carried out to compare the type of methionine precursor and by each bacterial strain --- it is introduced respectively has
The yield of the plasmid of four types --- production.Flask test carry out it is as follows: each bacterial strain streak inoculation on LB plate, 31
It cultivates 16 hours, and single colonie is inoculated in the LB culture medium of 3mL, and with the rate of 200rpm 31 in DEG C incubator
It is cultivated 16 hours in DEG C incubator. 
 The culture medium of the production methionine precursor shown into the table 1 of 250mL flask addition 25mL, and then add respectively
The culture solution previously prepared added with 500 every kind of μ L.Then, it is small to cultivate 40 with the rate of 200rpm in 31 DEG C of incubators for flask
When, and compare the type and amount of the methionine precursor obtained in every kind of bacterial strain for being introduced into every kind of plasmid.As the result is shown

PCL_Pcj1_metA (wt) and CJW2H pCL_Pcj1_metA#11 bacterial strain --- it respectively includes Escherichia coli wild-type
MetA gene and metA#11 gene, both genes have feed back resistance --- production o-succinyl homoserine, however
CJM2pCL_Pcj1_dra metX and CJW2H pCL_Pcj1_dra metX bacterial strain --- it respectively includes from radiation hardness
The metX gene of coccus --- production O-acetylhomoserine. 
 Be originated from Chromobacterium violaceum metX gene in the case where, the gene with metA gene compared with with it is other
The high homology of metX homologous gene (ortholog).However, about substrate specificity, not with the metX gene generally reported
Together, which is the homoserine succinyltransferase for producing succinyl homoserine. 
 In addition, in the case where introducing Escherichia coli wild-type metA (wt) gene, due to being added with the concentration of 0.3g/L
The phenomenon that adding to the feedback inhibition of the methionine of culture medium, o-succinyl homoserine generate about 1g/L, however, drawing working as
In the case where the metX gene for entering to be originated from Chromobacterium violaceum, the gene even with wild type itself without any introducing is repaired
Decorations, o-succinyl homoserine generate, without the methionine for being added to culture medium feedback inhibition the phenomenon that. 
 Introducing has the CJM2 bacterial strain of pCL_Pcj1_cvi metX (CJM2pCL_Pcj1_cvi metX) June 20 in 2013
