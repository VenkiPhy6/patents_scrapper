 " homogeneity percentage " or " percent similarity " between two nucleotide sequences is represented, in the complete of aligned sequences
The homogeneity percentage of residue in whole length, by comparison window (the Local Alignment length between two sequences is defined)
Compare the sequence of two optimal local alignments to determine, e.g., for example, (for quite similar sequence) (is compared by program AE2
Editing machine 2) it is artificial compare after the homogeneity that calculates.Local Alignment between two sequences is only included thinks enough phases according to standard
As each sequence section, the standard depends on being used for the algorithm being compared (for example, AE2, BLAST, rRNA molecule
Secondary structure etc.).Homogeneity percentage is calculated as follows：Determine the quantity of the position of identical nucleic acid occur to produce in two sequences
Total positional number in matched position number, matched position number divided by comparison window, is as a result multiplied by 100. 
 In order to determine the Percent sequence of two nucleotide sequences (for example, one of nucleotide sequence of table 1 and its homologue)
Homogeneity is optimal omparison purpose and aligned sequences (for example, in order to another nucleic acid best alignment, can be in a nucleic acid sequence
Room is introduced in row).Then the base positioned at relevant position is compared.When in a position in a sequence and another sequence
When relevant position is occupied by identical base, then two molecules are identicals in the position.It is appreciated that to determine sequence identity
Purpose, when DNA sequence dna is compared with RNA sequence, thymidine nucleotide is equal to uridylate. 
 To be compared, by sequence data input program AE2 ( http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/   molbio/unix/ae2.readme ), manually compared according to the secondary structure of resulting rRNA molecules, and with belonging to heavy wall
The biological representative 16S rRNA gene orders of bacterium door (Firmicutes) are compared (Nucl.Acids Res.27,171-
173,1999).In order to obtain the % homogeneity values of multiple sequences, all sequences are compared each other (Multiple sequence alignments).In addition,
Compared with multiple alignment, in order to obtain the % homogeneity values on the more long-chain of aligned sequences between two sequences, according to above institute
State, using AE2, carried out artificial sequence alignment (paired sequence alignment) in pairs.

 According to being not disclosed that the result (Figure 12 to 22) of Phylogenetic analysis presented herein and Germany Borriss are taught
As a result, propose that heterogeneous species Paenibacillus polymyxa needs new taxology classification, be divided into two subspecies： 
 1) subspecies (Paenibacillus polymyxa ssp.polymyxa) and 2 are glued Paenibacillus polymyxa more) glue more
Series bacillus plant subspecies (Paenibacillus polymyxa ssp.plantarum) and 3) new species-i.e., class gemma
Bacillus grows nonparasitically upon another plant new species (Paenibacillus nov.spec.epiphyticus). 
 Type strain Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM36, with Paenibacillus polymyxa bacterial strain SQR-21, CF05, CICC
10580th, NRRL B-30509 and A18 together, for five conservative house-keeping genes (dnaN, gyrB, recA, recN and
RpoA) in each of the maximum likelihood dendrogram of analysis, separated cluster (Figure 17-21) is formed. 
 Closely similar result is obtained by determining average amino acid homogeneity (AAI), average amino acid homogeneity is normal
It is usually used in determining the phylogenetic relationship between bacterial species.This method based on amino acid levels core genome it is average same
The calculating (Proc.Natl.Acad.USA 102,2567-2572,2005) of one property.It is many according to the AAI- matrixes obtained in Figure 22
Viscous series bacillus DSM36 forms sub- cluster together with Paenibacillus polymyxa SQR-21 bacterial strains, different from another two shown in it
Individual sub- cluster. 
 Bacterial strain Lu16674 and Lu17007 is together with bacterial strain Paenibacillus polymyxa M-1,1-43, SC2 and Sb3-1, in pin
Each of the maximum likelihood dendrogram of house-keeping gene (dnaN, gyrB, recA, the recN and rpoA) analysis conservative to five
In, form second sub- cluster (Figure 17-21).According to the AAI- matrixes based on core gene group analysis in Figure 22, the second sub- cluster
It is confirmed by its representative bacterial strain Lu16674 and Lu17007 together with Paenibacillus polymyxa M-1 and SC2 bacterial strain.

Bacillus, can not be appointed as any other known series bacillus species.For bacterial strain E681 (94.7%) and CR2
(94.9%), it was found that similar value.There is at least 98.1% homogeneity (AAI) between these three bacterial strains.According to
Konstantinides and Tiedje species define (Proc Natl.Acad.Sci.USA.102,2567-2572,2005),
Bacterial strain Lu17015 and bacterial strain E681 and CR2 can be designated as new species.Therefore, new species-i.e., class bud are herein proposed
Spore bacillus grows nonparasitically upon another plant new species.Correspondingly, series bacillus bacterial strain Lu17015 belongs to the series bacillus (Paenibacillus that grows nonparasitically upon another plant
epiphyticus).It should be type strain to propose the bacterial strain.Equally, the tree that the sequence based on five house-keeping genes compares
Shape figure (Figure 17-21) shows, this cluster with away from every other Paenibacillus polymyxa bacterial strain.Except Lu17015, propose many
Viscous series bacillus bacterial strain E681, CR2TD94, DSM365 and WLY78 should also be as belonging to series bacillus and grow nonparasitically upon another plant new species.
