 Background technology 
 
 
 1. invention field 
 The present invention relates to the recombinant microorganism of the putrescine productivity with improvement and use it to produce the method for putrescine with high yield. 
 
 
 2. description of related art 
 Polyamines such as spermidine, spermine etc. are present in most of viable cell, and putrescine (or Putriscine) is as the precursor in spermidine and spermine metabolism.Putrescine finds in Gram-negative bacteria or fungi, and it exists with high density in various species, and this shows that it has vital role in the pathways metabolism of microorganism. 
 Generally speaking, the important source material in synthesis that putrescine is polyamine nylon-4,6---it produces by reacting with hexanodioic acid---.Putrescine is mainly through producing from the chemosynthesis of propylene by vinyl cyanide and sym-dicyanoethane.This chemosynthesis is three-step approach, it hydrogenation reaction comprising catalytic oxidation, use the reaction of cyanide compound and use High Pressure Hydrogen.Because this chemosynthesis is not eco-friendly and consumes a large amount of energy yet, cause oil depletion, so existing problems.Therefore, the method needing exploitation to relate to the more eco-friendly of biomass economy and Energy Efficient is produced for putrescine. 
 In microbe, the biosynthetic pathway of putrescine is identical with the arginine synthetic route of synthesizing from L-glutamic acid to ornithine.Putrescine can from microorganism by two approach biosynthesizing.In an approach, as the ornithine decarboxylation of intermediate to synthesize putrescine.In another approach, produce agmatine, then from agmatine synthesis putrescine (Morris etc., JBiol.Chem.241:13,3129-3135,1996) by the arginine decarboxylic reaction synthesized from ornithine.These two approach produce the energy required for metabolism or make cell have resistance to oxidative stress. 
 As the method using microorganisms producing putrescine, to be in the news (International Patent Publication No. WO06/005603 with the method that high density produces putrescine by transformation of E. coli and coryneform bacteria; International Patent Publication No. WO09/125924; QianZD etc., Biotechnol.Bioeng.104:4,651-662,2009; Schneider etc., Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol.88:4,859-868,2010; Schneider etc., Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol.91:17-30,2011).Such as, WO09/125924 discloses and participates in the degraded of the putrescine existed in intestinal bacteria and the approach of utilization and the inactivation ornithine as the precursor of putrescine to arginic conversion by enhancing ornithine biosynthetic pathway instead of inactivation, carrys out the method for producing putrescine with high yield.In addition, Schneider (2010) discloses and can transform ornithine to the protein of putrescine enter certain bacterial strain of corynebacterium without putrescine productivity by transforming ornithine to the protein of putrescine and introduce certain bacterial strain of corynebacterium without putrescine productivity and strengthen, and produces the method for putrescine with high density. 
 And, the research of putrescine vehicle in intestinal bacteria, yeast, plant and animal cell is carried out (KIgarashi, PlantPhysiol.Biochem.48:506-512,2010) energetically.Colibacillary putrescine picked-up occurs via 4 kinds of approach; PotABCD or potFGHI driven by ATP hydrolytic action, and the puuP of potE and puu approach as H+ symport body (symporter).About the Km value participating in these complex bodys that putrescine absorbs, the Km value of PotFGHI, potABCD, potE and puuP is respectively 0.5mM, 1.5mM, 1.8mM and 3.7mM.In these four kinds of putrescine picked-up approach, potFGHI complex body is considered to most suitable.In addition, potE vehicle has the function of picked-up and secretion both putrescine.Putrescine is transfused in cell under neutral ph together with proton.But, because putrescine synthase (speF) is expressed under condition of acidic pH, so there is (Kurihara etc., J.Bacteriology191:8 in the cellular uptake of extracellular ornithine and the cell exocrine of putrescine that synthesizes in cell simultaneously, 2776-2782,2009). 
 It is TPO1 and TPO4 that putrescine known in yeast exports albumen (exporter).The aminoacid sequence of these aminoacid sequences and genus bacillus multiple medicines vehicle Blt is closely similar. 
 These the two kinds potE sharing feature exported in albumen and intestinal bacteria, and they have the function of input putrescine, spermidine and spermine in the basic conditions and export them in acid condition.In addition, the yeast cell of process LAN TPO5 gene has resistance to 120mM putrescine, otherwise the mutant of destruction TPO5 gene is to 90mM putrescine sensitivity (Tachihara etc., J.BiologicalChemistry, 280 (13): 12637-12642,2005). 
 The synthesis of putrescine and degraded in zooblast, and picked-up and secretion regulate and control in a different manner.Although also do not carry out in zooblast and intestinal bacteria or yeast the research of polyamine secretion, report SLC3A2 (arginine/diamines exports albumen) is had to play a part arginine is inputted cell and exports putrescine, acetyl spermidine and acetyl spermine in colon epithelial cell.But, not about picked-up in vegetable cell and the report (Igarashi etc., PlantPhysiol. & Biochem.48:506-512,2010) exporting putrescine. 
 On the other hand, because certain microorganism of corynebacterium does not have putrescine biosynthetic pathway, so also do not carry out the research exported about putrescine.According to nearest report, recover Growth of Cells by process LAN cg2983 membranin in the bacterial strain producing cadaverine and strengthen cadaverine productivity (Kind etc., MetabolicEngineering13:617-627,2011). 
 But, also not about the report of the association between putrescine output albumen and the microbial growth of putrescine productivity or production putrescine.In above document, do not mention about the association between cg2983 membranin and the fan-out capability of putrescine. 
 Within this context, the present inventor has carried out many effort can produce putrescine with more high yield bacterial strain with exploitation.As a result, the putrescine that NCgl2522 function is disclosed as in putrescine production bacterial strain---certain microorganism of corynebacterium---exports albumen, and can produce putrescine by strengthening its activity compared with NCgl2522 endogenous activity with high yield.In addition, in substratum, the amount of putrescine can be passed through to increase at the expression in escherichia coli NCgl2522 with putrescine route of synthesis, and therefore the present inventor shows that NCgl2522 also plays putrescine and exports albumen in intestinal bacteria, thus completes the present invention.
