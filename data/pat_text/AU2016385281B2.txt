 Title of Invention : BACTERIUM PRODUCING 
 MONOPHOSPHORYL LIPID A AND METHOD OF PRODUCING 
 MONOPHOSPHORYL LIPID A BY USING BACTERIUM 
 Technical Field 
 [1] One or more embodiments relate to a bacterium that produces monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA), and a method of producing MLA by using the bacterium. 
 Background Art 
 [2] Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are one of the components of the outer membrane surrounding peptidoglycan of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS are molecules containing lipid A and a variety of polysaccharides conjugated with the lipid A by a covalent bond. Among the components of LPS, Lipid A, which is also known as endotoxin, is held responsible for the toxicity of Gram-negative bacteria. 
 [3] Lipid A is a very potent stimulant of the immune system, activating cells (for example, monocytes or macrophages) at picogram per milliliter quantitites. Lipid A, derivatives of lipid A, or varients of lipid A can be used as, for example, components of vaccines such as adjuvants. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) is used as adjuvants and used for allergen-specific immunotherapy and immunotherapy of cancer, or also effective in prevention and treatment of dementia. 
 Furthermore, among MLA, hexa-acylated-monophosphoryl lipid A (hexa-acylated MLA), pentaacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A (penta-acylated MLA), and 3-O-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MLA) are effective in the above-mentioned use. Lipid A is a lipid component found in the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. Lipid A found in the membrane conjugates to sugars, such as 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Kdo). Therefore, in order to obtain lipid A in a free form, it should be isolated from the other components of LPS. For example, LPS can be extracted from bacterial membranes, heated in the presence of acids so as to remove Kdo, and a 1-phosphate group, thereby obtaining Lipid A; or MLA can be synthesized by chemical processing. However, these methods have drawbacks in that they are complicated in steps of the processes, with a low yield. 
 [4] Therefore, there is a need to develop a method of producing MLA and derivatives thereof, which is simpler than the conventional methods, without acid hydrolysis.

 [8] The term increase expression used herein refers to a detectable increase in expression product of a certain gene, for example, mRNA or a protein encoded by the gene in a cell. The term parent bacterial cell used herein refers to a bacterial cell of the same type that does not have a particular genetic modification. When a wild-type cell is used in the genetic modification, the parent bacterial cell may be a wild-type cell. For example, bacterium comprising a genetic modification that increases expression of a gene may have higher level of expression product than that of parent bacterial cell by about 5% or more, about 10% or more, about 15% or more, about 20% or more, about 30% or more, about 40% or more, about 50% or more, about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, about 95% or more, or about 100% or more. 
 Increase in expression product in a cell may be verified by any methods known in the art. The level of expression product may be determined by measuring activities or quantities of the expression product such as mRNA or protein. 
 [9] The term decrease expression used herein refers to a detectable decrease in expression product of a certain gene, for example, mRNA or a protein encoded by the gene in a cell. The term parent bacterial cell used herein refers to a bacterial cell of the same type that does not have a particular genetic modification. When a wild-type cell is used in the genetic modification, the parent bacterial cell may be a wild-type cell. For example, bacterium comprising a genetic modification that decreases expression of a gene may have lower level of expression product than that of parent bacterial cell by about 5% or more, about 10% or more, about 15% or more, about 20% or more, about 30% or more, about 40% or more, about 50% or more, about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, about 95% or more, or about 100% or more.

 Decrease in expression product in a cell may be verified by any methods known in the art. The level of expression product may be determined by measuring activities or quantities of the expression product such as mRNA or protein. 
 [10] The terms disruption, disrupted, and the like used herein refer to reduced expression of a given gene due to a genetic modification. Disruption can be caused by a genetic modification that completely nullifies expression of a referenced gene 
 WO 2017/119628 
 PCT/KR2016/014761 (hereinafter, referred to as inactivation of a gene.). Disruption also includes a genetic modification that causes expression of a gene at decreased levels without completely nullifying expression (hereinafter, referred to as attenuation of a gene.). Expression, in this sense, refers to transcription of a gene product as well as translation of an active gene product. Thus, inactivation includes a case in which a gene is not transcribed or translated, such that the product of a gene is not expressed, and a case in which, although a gene is transcribed and translated, the gene product is not functional. Similarly, attenuation includes a case in which transcription and/or translation of a gene is reduced, as well as a case in which transcription and/or translation is not reduced, but the gene product has a lower activity level. Herein, the term a functional product of a gene means that the gene product (e.g., protein or enzyme) has a biochemical or physiologic function (for example, enzyme activity). The disruption of the gene includes a functional disruption of the gene, wherein the biochemical or physiologic function in a genetically modified cell is reduced or completely nullified in comparison to a parent or wild-type cell. 
 [11] Genetic modification includes a modification that introduces a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide into a cell; a modification that substitutes, adds (i.e., inserts), or deletes one or more nucleotides of the genetic material of a parent cell, including a chemical modification (exposure to a chemical) resulting in a change to the genetic material of a parent cell. Genetic modification includes a heterologous or homologous modification of referenced species. Genetic modification includes a modification of a coding region for polypeptides. Genetic modification also includes a modification of non-coding regulatory regions that change expression of a gene or function of an operon. Non-coding regions include 5'-non-coding sequence (5' of a coding sequence) and 3'-non-coding sequence (3' of a coding sequence). 
 [12] The disruption of a gene may be achieved by a genetic engineering method, such as homologous recombination, directed mutagenesis, or directed molecular evolution. When a cell includes a plurality of identical genes or 2 or more paralogs of a gene, one or more genes may be disrupted. For example, the genetic modification may involve transforming a cell with a vector including the sequence of a gene, and then culturing the cell to cause a homologous recombination of the exogenous nucleic acid and an endogenous gene of the cell, thereby disrupting the endogenous gene. The cell that has undergone homologous recombination can be screened out (selected) by using a selective marker. 
 [13] The gene used herein refers to a nucleic acid fragment that encodes a particular protein, which may optionally include at least one regulatory sequence, such as a 5'-non-coding sequence and a 3'-non-coding sequence (3' and 5' in reference to the position relative to the coding sequence). 
 WO 2017/119628 
 PCT/KR2016/014761 
 [14] The term sequence identity of a nucleic acid or polypeptide used herein refers to a degree of identity of nucleotides or amino acid residues of two corresponding sequences over a particular region measured after the sequences are aligned to be matched with each other as much as possible. The sequence identity is a value that is measured by comparing two optimally aligned corresponding sequences of a particular comparable region, wherein in the comparable region, a part of the sequence may be added or deleted compared to a reference sequence. In some embodiments, a percentage of the sequence identity may be calculated by comparing two optimally aligned corresponding sequences in an entire comparable region, determining the number of locations where an amino acid or a nucleic acid is identical in the two sequences to obtain the number of matched locations, dividing the number of the matched locations by the total number (that is, a range size) of all locations within a comparable range, and multiplying the result by 100 to obtain a percentage of the sequence identity. The percent of the sequence identity may be determined by using known sequence comparison programs, examples of which include BLASTN and BLASTP (NCBI), CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio.), MegAlign™ (DNASTAR Inc). 
 [15] In identifying polypeptides or polynucleotides of different species that may have identical or similar function or activity, similarity in sequence identity may be used. For example, similar sequences may have a sequence identity of 50% or more, 55% or more, 60% or more, 65% or more, 70% or more, 75% or more, 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more, 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, 99% or more, or 100%. 
 [16] The term exogenous and the like used herein refers to a referenced molecule (e.g., nucleic acid) or referenced activity that has been introduced into a host cell. A nucleic acid may be exogenously introduced into a host in any suitable manner. For example, a nucleic acid can be introduced into a host cell and inserted into a host chromosome, or the nucleic acid can be introduced into the host as non-chromosomal genetic material, such as an expression vector (e.g., a plasmid) that does not integrate into the host chromosome. A nucleic acid encoding a protein should be introduced in an expressionable form (i.e., so that the nucleic acid can be transcribed and translated). The exogenous gene may include a homologous gene, i.e., an identical gene with the endogenous gene, or a heterologous gene.

Examples of the organic solvent may include chloroform, phenol, petroleum ether, dichloromethane, methanol, hexane, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, ethanol, or a combination thereof. Examples of the method of extracting lipid may be a Bligh and Dyer lipid extraction protocol (see Bligh, E.G. and Dyer, W.J., Can. J. Biochem. Physiol., 1959, vol.37, p.911-917). The method may further include purifying MLA in lipid. The method may not include hydrolysis step to remove Kdo moiety since the obtained lipid A may be a free form, i.e., not conjugated to Kdo moiety. 
 [42] The MLA may include 1-dephospho-lipid A, 1-dephospho-tetra-acylated lipid A, 1dephospho-penta-acylated lipid A, 3D-MLA, or a combination thereof.

 [93] 3.1. Extraction of lipid from Escherichia coli W3110 transformed with pWSK29-FnLpxE by acid hydrolysis 
 [94] For a comparative experiment, an Escherichia coli strain W3110 into which pWSK29-FnLpxE was transformed, and an Escherichia coli strain W3110 into which pWSK29-FnLpxE was untransformed were prepared. 
 [95] Specifically, a pWSK29-FnLpxE (Wang, X., Karbarz, M. J., McGrath, S. C., Cotter, R. J., and Raetz, C. R„ J Biol Chem (2004), vol.279 (47), p. 49470-49478) was prepared, which amplifies a polynucleotide (gblCP000439.11:414941-415660 Erancisella novicida U112, SEQ ID NO: 25) that encodes FnLpxE polypeptides (gilll8422929lgblABK89319.1, Erancisella novicida U112 lipid A phosphatase, SEQ ID NO: 24). The prepared pWSK29-FnLpxE was transformed into an Escherichia coli strain W3110 by electroporation, and then the transformed Escherichia coli was selected on an LB solid medium containing 50 //g/mf of ampicillin. The selected colony was inoculated into an LB liquid medium containing 50 //g/mf of ampicillin, and then cultured overnight at 37°C. The culture solution was inoculated into 200 mf of a fresh LB liquid medium containing 50 //g/mf of ampicillin such that absorbance measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) was 0.06. The diluted culture solution was cultured at 37°C until OD600 reached 1.0. Then, the culture solution was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 4000x g at room temperature for about 20 minutes, thus obtaining a cultured Escherichia coli strain W3110. 
 [96] An untransformed Escherichia coli strain W3110 was inoculated into a fresh LB liquid medium, and then cultured overnight at 37°C. The culture solution was diluted with 200 mf of a fresh LB liquid medium such that OD600 was 0.06. The diluted culture solution was cultured at 37°C until OD600 reached 1.0. Then, the culture solution was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 4000x g at room temperature for about 20 minutes, thus obtaining a cultured Escherichia coli strain W3110. The obtained Escherichia coli, pWSK29-FnLpxE/W3110 and W3110, were each washed with 30 mf of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then resuspended with 8 mf of PBS. 10 mf of chloroform (EMD millipore) and 20 mf of methanol (EMD millipore) were added to the resuspended Escherichia coli, and then incubated at room temperature for about 1 hour by shaking the mixture a few times. Subsequently, the incubated mixture was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 2500x g for about 30 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant of the centrifuged mixture was discarded, and then the pellet was resuspended with 30 mf of a solution of chloroform, methanol, and PBS at a ratio of 1:2:0.8 (v/v). The resuspended mixture was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 2500x g for about 30 minutes at room temperature, and the supernatant of the centrifuged mixture was discarded. The pellet was washed two more times in the same manner as above and then the supernatant of the centrifuged mixture was discarded.

 PCT/KR2016/014761 
 The washed pellet was resuspended with 18 mf of a 12.5 mM sodium acetate solution (pH 4.5, Sigma-Aldrich) and then sonic-irradiated. The sonic-irradiated solution was heated airtight in boiling water at a temperature of 100°C for about 30 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature. 20 mf of chloroform (EMD millipore) and 20 mf of methanol (EMD millipore) were added to the cooled solution and then fully mixed together with one another, followed by centrifuging the mixture at a centrifugal force of 2500x g for about 20 minutes at room temperature. An organic solvent layer was separated from the centrifuged mixture, and then a pre-equilibrated organic solvent layer was added to the upper aqueous layer so as to extract an organic solvent layer twice. The organic solvent layer was pooled, and then dried in a rotary evaporator to obtain lipid. The obtained lipid was dissolved in 5 mf of a mixture of chloroform and methanol at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v), and then sonic-irradiated in a water bath. The sonicirradiated lipid was moved to a new test tube, and then the obtained lipid was dried at room temperature under nitrogen gas, followed by storing at -80°C. 
 [97] 3.2. Extraction of lipid from Escherichia coli KHSC003 transformed with pBDA33.1, pBAD33.1-AaLpxE, or pBAD33.1-HpLpxE 
 [98] The plasmid prepared in 1.2.2, pBAD33.1-AaLpxE or pBAD33.1-HpLpxE, was transformed into Escherichia coli KHSC003 prepared in 2.4, and then the lipid of the membrane of Escherichia coli was tested. As for a negative control group, Escherichia coli KHSC003, into which a vector pBAD33.1 was transformed, was used. 
 [99] Specifically, the vector pBAD33.1, pBAD33.1-AaLpxE prepared in 1.2.2, or pBAD33.1-HpLpxE prepared in 1.2.3 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain KHSC003 prepared in 2.4 by electroporation. The KHSC003 strain containing pBAD33.1-AaLpxE has been deposited in the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, which is an international depository authority under the Budapest Treaty as of November 18, 2016 (Accession Number: KCTC 13155BP). The KHSC003 strain containing pBAD33.1-HpLpxE has been deposited in the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, which is an international depository authority under the Budapest Treaty as of November 18, 2016 (Accession Number: KCTC 13156BP). 
 [100] The transformed Escherichia coli was inoculated to an LB liquid medium containing 50 //g/mf of ampicillin (EMD millipore) and 30 //g/mf chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich), and then cultured overnight at 30°C. The culture solution was inoculated to 200 mf of an LB liquid medium containing 50 //g/mf of ampicillin, 30 //g/mf of chloramphenicol, and 1 mM of isopropyl I -thio-[>-D-galactoside (IPTG, UBP Bio), and thus the culture solution was diluted such that OD600 was 0.06 to 0.1. The culture solution was cultured until OD600 reached 0.5 to 0.6. The culture solution was centrifuged at room temperature at a centrifugal force of 4000x g for about 20 minutes

 PCT/KR2016/014761 so as to obtain Escherichia coli. The obtained Escherichia coli was washed with 30 mf of PBS and then resuspended with 8 mf of PBS. 10 mf of chloroform and 20 mf of methanol were added to the resuspended Escherichia coli, and then incubated at room temperature for about 1 hour with shaking a few times. The incubated mixture was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 2500x g for about 30 minutes at room temperature, thus obtaining the supernatant thereof. 10 mf of chloroform and 10 mf of water were added to the obtained supernatant followed by complete-mixing of the mixture. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at a centrifugal force of 2500x g for about 20 minutes at room temperature. An organic solvent layer was separated from the centrifuged mixture, and then a pre-equilibrated organic solvent layer was added to the upper aqueous layer so as to extract an organic solvent layer twice. The organic solvent layer was pooled, and then dried in a rotary evaporator to obtain lipid. The obtained lipid was dissolved in 5 mf of a solution of chloroform and methanol at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v), and then sonic-irradiated in a water bath. The sonic-irradiated lipid was moved to a new test tube, and then the obtained lipid was dried at room temperature under nitrogen gas, followed by storing at -80°C. 
 [101] 3.3. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis on lipid 
 [102] In order to perform TLC, as described in 3.1 or 3.2, lipid was obtained from 200 mf of an Escherichia coli culture solution, and one-third of the total obtained lipid was dissolved in 200 [A of a mixture of chloroform and methanol at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v). Subsequently, 5 [A to 15 [A of the mixture was spotted on a 10x10 cm HPTLC plate (EMD Chemicals) and developed in a solvent of chloroform, methanol, water, and ammonium hydroxide (from 30% to 20%) at a ratio of 40:25:4:2 (v/v). The developed plate was then dried, visualized by spraying 10% (v/v) of sulfuric acid (in ethanol) thereto, and then was charred on a hot plate of 300°C. The results of lipid TLC are shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B (In FIG. 3A, Fane 1: lipids obtained by acid hydrolysis of the extracted EPS from Escherichia coli W3110, Fane 2: lipids obtained by acid hydrolysis of the extracted EPS from Escherichia coli W3110 containing pWSK29-FnEpxE, Fane 3: extracted lipids obtained from Escherichia coli KHSC003 containing pBAD33.1, and Fane 4: extracted lipids obtained from Escherichia coli KHSC003 containing pBAD33.1-AaEpxE; and in FIG. 3B, Fane 1: lipids obtained by acid hydrolysis of the extracted EPS from Escherichia coli W3110, Fane 2: extracted lipids obtained from Escherichia coli KHSC003 containing pBAD33.1-HpEpxE, and Fane 3: extracted lipids obtained from Escherichia coli KHSC003 containing pBAD33.1). 
 [103] As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, lipid A was detected from Escherichia coli W3110 that underwent the process of acid hydrolysis (Fane 1 in FIG. 3A), and 1-dephospho-lipid A was detected from Escherichia coli W3110 including 
 WO 2017/119628 
 PCT/KR2016/014761 pWSK29-FnLpxE that underwent the process of acid hydrolysis (Lane 2 in FIG. 3A). In addition, lipid A detected from Escherichia coli KHSC003 was detected (Lane 3 in FIG. 3A), and 1-dephospho-lipid A detected from Escherichia coli KHSC003 including pBAD33.1-AaLpxE or pBAD33.1-HpLpxE was detected (Lane 4 in FIG. 3A or Lane 2 in FIG. 3B). Therefore, since the membrane of Escherichia coli KHSC003 transformed with pBAD33.1-AaLpxE or pBAD33.1-HpLpxE contained 1-dephospho-lipid A, it was found that living Escherichia coli containing 1-dephospho-lipid A in the membrane can be obtained. Escherichia coli KHSC003 transformed with pBAD33.1-HplLpxE, i.e., pBAD33.1-HplpxE/ KHSC003 was internationally deposited on Nov 23, 2016 with Accession Number KCTC13156BP to Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) which is an International Depositary Authority according to Budapest Treaty. 
 [104] 3.4. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDLTOF) mass spectrometry on lipid A and 1-dephospho-lipid A 
 [105] The lipid obtained as described in 3.2 was resuspended with a mixture of chloroform and methanol at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v), and the resuspended lipid sample was sent to Korea Basic Science Institute to request MALDLTOF mass spectrometry. 
 [106] Specifically, a mixture solution of 10 mg/mf of a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) at a ratio of 1:4 was used as matrix. 1 [A of the matrix solution was spread on a sample stub, and 1 [A of the resuspended lipid sample was spotted thereon, followed by vacuum-drying. MALDL TOF mass spectrometry was performed on the lipid sample by using a MALDLTOF mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Biotech Axima Resonance). The mass spectrometry data was analyzed by using mMass software (http://www.mmass.org/). The analysis results of MALDLTOF MS are shown in FIG. 4A. The analysis results of MALDLTOF MSMS are shown in FIG. 4B (x-axis: mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), y-axis: relative intensity (%))· 
 [107] As shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, it was found that from Escherichia coli KHSC003 transformed with pBAD33.1-AaLpxE, monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) not including Kdo, i.e., 1-dephospho-lipid A (the actual unit mass: 1716.25), was detected. Therefore, by the expression of EcLpxM, EcLpxL, and AaLpxE polypeptides in Escherichia coli, it was found that living Escherichia coli containing 1-dephospho-lipid A in the membrane can be obtained. Escherichia coli KHSC003 transformed with pBAD33.1-AaLpxE, i.e., pBAD33.1-AaLpxE/ KHSC003 was internationally deposited on Nov 18, 2016 with Accession Number KCTC13155BP to Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) which is an International Depositary Authority according to Budapest Treaty.
