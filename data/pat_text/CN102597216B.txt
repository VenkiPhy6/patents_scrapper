 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to novel plant Bacterium lacticum (Lactobacillus plantarum) and composition thereof, more specifically, relate to novel plant Bacterium lacticum and the composition thereof of prevention or treatment intestinal tract disease and immunological disease. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 At the leavened food of Korean traditional, the milk-acid bacteria such as, found in pickles inhabits in the Digestive tract of human body, decomposes filamentary material by protein synthesis important nutrient.Great-hearted microorganism is as useful in the digestive tube of milk-acid bacteria to host, because these microorganisms improve the enteric microorganism environment of host, this host, as animal, comprises the mankind, and these microorganisms are called as probiotic bacterium.Because probiotic bacterium needs Orally administered, through small intestine is also attached to small intestine surface to play the effect of probiotic bacterium, so probiotic bacterium needs to have excellent acid resistance and Bile tolerance, and the strong adhesive force to intestinal epithelial cells. 
 At the leavened food of Korean traditional, the lactobacillus milk-acid bacteria such as, generally found in pickles is probiotic bacterium.Lactobacillus microorganism produces lactic acid under homofermentation or heterofermentation, and generally finds in the animal intestinal comprising the mankind with in milk-product and vegetable fermentation.Lactobacillus microorganism keeps acid ph value balance to suppress unwanted bacteria, as the propagation of intestinal bacteria or clostridium, and alleviates and suffers from diarrhoea and constipation.Lactobacillus microorganism also synthesise vitamins, has antitumour activity and reduces serum cholesterol.The known lactobacillin produced by Bacterium lacticum is for suppressing the growth of Shigellae, Salmonellas, staphylococcus, intestinal bacteria etc.Lactobacillin also suppresses the propagation causing the microorganism of suffering from diarrhoea, and make intestinal microflora normalizing with pre-anti-diarrhea (Michael and Philippe, Probiotics and prebiotics:Effects on diarrhea, The journal of nutrition, Volume 137, March 2007, pages 803S-811S; Roberfroid, Prebiotics and probiotics:Are they functional foods?, American journal of clinical nutrition, Volume 71, June 2000, pages 1682S-1687S). 
 According to the function of above-mentioned lactobacillus microorganism, active research is carried out to the lactobacillus microorganism as probiotic bacterium and animal feed.The bacterial diarrhea occurred in livestock body causes death and reduces rate of body weight gain.Therefore, generally use and add antibiotic method to prevent bacterial diarrhea and to increase the productivity of livestock to animal feed.But, due to the antibiotic resistant bacteria that occurs in livestock body and residual antibiotic, antibiotic use is limited, and propose organic procedures (Korean Patent Publication No. 1998-78358) (McEwen and Fedorka-Cray of raise livestock, Antimicrobial use and resistance in animals, Clinical infectious Diseases, Volume 34, June 2002, pages S93-S106). 
 In addition, known milk-acid bacteria strengthens immunne response effect as lactobacillus microorganism has.Therefore, the mechanism of action of milk-acid bacteria in enhancing immunne response is studied.Although do not disclose special mechanism, know that milk-acid bacteria is Orally administered, and be present in enteron aisle to affect intestinal tract immune system.Such as, known by Yoghourt absorb milk-acid bacteria to strengthen the lymphocytic anti-microbial activity of aggregate lymphatic nodule.According to the research to animals and humans, known milk-acid bacteria strengthens IgA response.In addition, in vivo antagonistic immunity system is shown to outside microbial pathogen and be divided into congenital immunity and adaptive immunity, both affect by milk-acid bacteria.According to the congenital immunity of intestinal tract immune system, known milk-acid bacteria prevents and kills pathogenic agent, thus has body is kept fit not infected function.Innate immune response suppresses to play an important role in the growth of external pathological body quantity at the commitment infected.In addition, innate immune response delivery of antigens and costimulatory molecules, thus the activation of adaptive immunity after bringing out innate immune system.The representative immunocyte relating to innate immune response comprises NK cell, neutrophil leucocyte, scavenger cell and dendritic cell (Fearon DT, Locksley RM, Science 1996,272:50-53, The instructive role of innate immunity in the acquired immune response).When experimenter infects, adaptive immunity induces the removal of external pathological body substantially, and the immunocyte corresponding to adaptive immunity comprises T lymphocyte and bone-marrow-derived lymphocyte.Therefore, enhancing (Gowans JL., the Immunology Today.1996Jun of adaptive immunity activity may be depended on to the physical resistance of outside pathogenic agent; 17 (6): 288-91, The lymphocyte-a disgraceful gap in medical knowledge). 
 According to adaptive immunity, decomposition antigen is contacted the lymphocytic macrophage activation of T to increase the generation of cytokine profiles, particularly interleukin-, IL-12 and IL-18 to make it.In this respect, some composition of lactic-acid bacteria cells wall activates NF-κ B and STAT signal in scavenger cell, changes the generation increasing cytokine.In addition, known milk-acid bacteria increases the generation of IL-12, IL-18 and TNF-α in antigen presenting cell such as dendritic cell, and this dendritic cell finds usually in the lymphatic node of Digestive tract and mucous membrane.And, known milk-acid bacteria adds the expression of surface molecular in dendritic cell, this activated dendritic cell T lymphocyte, as MHC II class and B7-2 (Cross etc., Anti-allergy properties of fermented foods:an important immunoregulatory mechanism of lactic acid bacteria?, International Immunopharmacology, Volume 1, May 2001, pages 891-901). 
 A lot of research has been carried out in mutual relationship between lactobacillus microorganism and immune response.Particularly, known some lactobacillus (such as lactobacillus fermentum) enhancement antigen specific immune response, therefore attempt and it can be used as the adjuvant of bacterium (such as diphtheria, tetanus) or virus (such as influenza virus, poliovirus) vaccine to use (de Vrese etc., 2005; Olivares etc., 2007; West etc., 2008).Think that the immuno-potentiation of lactobacillus microorganism is derived from the lymphocytic activity of T that the Th1 type strengthened by specific lactic bacillus microorganisms produces cytokine, it induces the growth of the general immunocyte in adaptive immunity and the activity (Mohamadzadeh etc. of T cell or B cell effectively, Lactobacilli activate human dendritic cells that skew T cells toward T helper 1 polarization., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.2005 22; 102 (8): 2880-2885).In order to measure the lymphocytic enhanced activity of T, the positive quantity to measuring the IFN-γ produced studies (Shida etc., 2006 in recent years; Foligne etc., 2007).Known bring out general immune cell growth can prevent or treat digestive tube (enteron aisle) infect (Jain S, Yadav H, Sinha PR.Probiotic dahi containing Lactobacillus casei protects against Salmonella enteritidis infection and modulates immune response in mice.J Med Food.2009Jun, 12 (3): 576-83.), urogenital infections (Zarate G, Santos V, Nader-Macias ME.Protective effect of vaginal Lactobacillus paracasei CRL 1289 against urogenital infection produced by Staphylococcus aureus in a mouse animal model.Infect Dis Obstet Gynecol.2009, 2009:48358.Epub 2007 Mar 29.), respiratory tract infection (Yasuda Y, Matsumura Y, Kasahara K, Ouji N, Sugiura S, Mikasa K, Kita E.Microbial exposure early in life regulates airway inflammation in mice after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae with enhancement of local resistance.Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol.2009 Sep 25 [Epub ahead of print]), helicobacter infection (Boyanova L, Stephanova-Kondratenko M, Mitov I.Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus strains:preliminary report.Lett Appl Microbiol.2009 May, 48 (5): 579-84.Epub 2009Mar 9.) and anaphylaxis (Ouwehand AC, Nermes M, Collado MC, Rautonen N, Salminen S, Isolauri E.Specific probiotics alleviate allergic rhinitis during the birch pollen season.World J Gastroenterol.2009 Jul 14, 15 (26): 3261-8). 
 T lymphocyte controls adaptive immunity, and it can be divided into replys as the Th1 response of cellular immunization and the Th2 as humoral immunization.Th1 and Th2 response produces different cytokines in antigen presenting cell.In Th1 response, mainly produce IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ).In Th2 response, mainly produce PGE2, IL-4 and IL-10.Need balance Th1 and Th2 response.If Th1 and Th2 replys imbalance, panimmunity disease can be produced.The main enantiopathy substance of Th1 cell, but Th2 cell relates generally to allergy and inflammatory response.When Th1 and Th2 response is in standard state, Th2 cytoprotective human body is not by the infringement of dust with other less desirable material.But if the response of Th2 cell transition, increase the generation of IgE antibody, thus cause the anaphylaxis of harmless protein, this protein is as pollen and food.Therefore, the ratio of Th1 and Th2 response should be balanced.Any one excessive or insufficient response all can cause disease in both.In addition, reply because continuous pressure causes the persistence of hydrocortisone to secrete minimizing Th1 and increase Th2 response, thus cause cancer, atopic disorder, allergy and autoimmune disorder (Elenkov and Chrousos, Stress hormones, Th1/Th2 patterns, pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and susceptibility to disease, Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Volume 10, November 1999, pages 359-368). 
 According to experiment in vivo, milk-acid bacteria adds the generation of IL-2 and IFN-γ, they are the Th1 cytokines in T lymphocyte, and milk-acid bacteria inhibits the generation of IL-4 and IL-5, they are Th2 cytokine (Matsuzaki etc., The effect of oral feeding of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota on immunoglobulin E production in mice, Journal of Dairy Science, Volume 81, January 1998, pages 48-53).Meanwhile, IL-12 and IL-18 is the important cytokine produced in scavenger cell or dendritic cell, and Th0 lymphocyte differentiation is Th1 lymphocyte by it.Known when in culturing process with milk-acid bacteria process splenocyte or scavenger cell time, the concentration of milk-acid bacteria is depended in the generation increasing IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-α.Therefore, milk-acid bacteria adds the generation of IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-α in scavenger cell, thus promote Th0 to the differentiation of Th1 and induced synthesis IFN-γ, therefore milk-acid bacteria is replied the budding stage at Th2 and to play an important role (Cross etc. to balance Th1/Th2, Anti-allergy properties of fermented foods:an important immunoregulatory mechanism of lactic acid bacteria? International Immunopharmacology, Volume 1, May 2001, pages 891-901).Therefore, known milk-acid bacteria prevention and therapy causes Th1/Th2 unbalance by the excessive response of Th2 and cancer, atopic disorder, allergy and the autoimmune disorder of bringing out.
