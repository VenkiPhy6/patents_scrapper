 UNSYMMETRICAL PYRROLOBENZODIAZEPINES-DIMERS FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF PROLIFERATIVE AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
 The present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), and their inclusion in targeted conjugates. The PBDs of the present invention are in a mixed dimer where one PBD moiety compises an imine or equivalent group and the other moiety comprises either an amine or amido group. The PBDs are linked to a cell binding agent via a substituent on the C2 position. 
 Background to the invention 
 Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 57935795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and numerous synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, etal., Chem. Rev. 1994, 433465 (1994); Antonow, D. and Thurston, D.E., Chem. Rev. 2011 111 (4), 2815-2864). 
 Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., J. Antibiotics, 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., J. Antibiotics, 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., Chem. Brit., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 
 Tetrahedron, 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., J. Antibiotics, 33, 665667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., J. Antibiotics, 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, J. Antibiotics, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, J. Org. Chem., 
 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, etal., J. Antibiotics, 41, 702-704 (1988); 
 Itoh, etal., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, etal., J. Am. Chem. 
 Soc., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, etal., J. Antibiotics, 25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure: 
 
 They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N=C), a carbinolamine(NH-CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NHWO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In Antibiotics III. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and NeedhamVanDevanter, Acc. Chem. Res., 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents. 
 It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8/C’-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D.S., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D.E., etal., J. Org. Chem., 61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5’-Pu-GATC-Py-3’ interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., etal., Biochemistry, 42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al., Biochemistry, 44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity. One example of a PBD dimmer, SG2000 (SJG-136): 
 
 has recently entered Phase II clinical trials in the oncology area (Gregson, S., et al., J. Med. Chem., 44, 737-748 (2001); Alley, M.C., etal., Cancer Research, 64, 6700-6706 (2004); Hartley, J.A., et al., Cancer Research, 64, 6693-6699 (2004)). 
 WO 2010/043880 discloses unsymmetrical dimeric PBD compound bearing aryl groups in the C2 position of each monomer, where one of these aryl groups bears a substituent designed to provide an anchor for linking the compound to another moiety. WO 2011/130613, discloses the inclusion of these PBD dimer compounds in targeted conjugates. WO 2011/130616, discloses unsymmetrical dimeric PBD compound bearing an aryl group in the C2 position of one monomer bearing a substituent designed to provide an anchor for linking the compound to another moiety, the other monomer bearing a nonaromatic group in the C2 position. The inclusion of these compounds in targeted conjugates is also disclosed. Co-pending International application PCT/EP2012/070233, 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 filed 12 October 2012, discloses further unsymmetrical dimeric PBD compound bearing an propylenyl group in the C2 position of one monomer bearing a substituent designed to provide an anchor for linking the compound to another moiety, the other monomer bearing an aromatic or non-aromatic group in the C2 position. 
 In 2002, Kamal described the synthesis and evaluation of PBD dimers having an imine bond in one PBD and an amide group in the other PBD (Kamal, A, et al., J. Med. Chem., 2002, 4679-4688), such as:

 Preferences 
 The following preferences may apply to all aspects of the invention as described above, or may relate to a single aspect. The preferences may be combined together in any combination. 
 In one embodiment, the Conjugate has the formula: 
 L- (A 1 a-L 1 s-L 2 y-D) p   
 L- (A 1 a-L s   1 -D) p , 
 L-(A 1 -L 1 -D) p  or 
 L- (A 1 -D) p  or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein L, A 1 , a, L 1 , s, L 2 , 
 D, y and p are as described above. 
 The present invention is suitable for use in providing a PBD compound to a preferred site in a subject. In the preferred embodiments, the conjugate allows the release of an active PBD compound that does not retain any part of the linker. There is no stub present that could affect the reactivity of the PBD compound. 
 In certain embodiments, the invention provides conjugates comprising a PBD dimer group having a linker connected to a cell binding agent. The present inventors describe herein methods of synthesis that enable such dimer conjugates to be prepared. 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 The linker attaches the Ligand Unit (L), e.g. antibody, to the PBD drug moiety D through covalent bond(s). The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety (D) and an antibody unit (Ab) to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). The linker may be stable outside a cell, i.e. extracellular, or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity, hydrolysis, or other metabolic conditions. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol, or an amine, e.g. Nterminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine, of the antibody (Ab) can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent, PBD drug moiety (D) or drug-linker reagent (D-R l ). 
 The linkers of the ADC preferably prevent aggregation of ADC molecules and keep the ADC freely soluble in aqueous media and in a monomeric state. 
 The linkers of the ADC are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport or delivery into a cell, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is preferably stable and remains intact, i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will: (i) maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody; (ii) allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety; (iii) remain stable and intact, i.e. not cleaved, until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targetted site; and (iv) maintain a cytotoxic, cellkilling effect or a cytostatic effect of the PBD drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy, HPLC, and the separation/analysis technique LC/MS. 
 Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker to have two reactive functional groups, i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties, such as peptides, nucleic acids, drugs, toxins, antibodies, haptens, and reporter groups are known, and methods have been described their resulting conjugates (Hermanson, G.T.

 In the various embodiments discussed herein, the nature of L 1  and L 2  can vary widely. These groups are chosen on the basis of their characteristics, which may be dictated in part, by the conditions at the site to which the conjugate is delivered. Where the Specificity unit L 1  is cleavable, the structure and/or sequence of L 1  is selected such that it is cleaved by the action of enzymes present at the target site (e.g., the target cell). L 1  units that are cleavable by changes in pH (e.g. acid or base labile), temperature or upon irradiation (e.g. photolabile) may also be used. L 1  units that are cleavable under reducing or oxidising conditions may also find use in the Conjugates. 
 In some embodiments, L 1  may comprise one amino acid or a contiguous sequence of amino acids. The amino acid sequence may be the target substrate for an enzyme. 
 In one embodiment, L 1  is cleavable by the action of an enzyme. In one embodiment, the enzyme is an esterase or a peptidase. For example, L 1  may be cleaved by a lysosomal protease, such as a cathepsin.

 Ligand Unit 
 The Ligand Unit may be of any kind, and include a protein, polypeptide, peptide and a non peptidic agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. In some embodiments, the 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 Ligand unit may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a cyclic polypeptide. These Ligand units can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one target molecule-binding site, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, or any other cell binding molecule or substance that can specifically bind to a target. The ligand Unit is also referred to herein as a “binding agent” or “targeting agent”. 
 The terms “specifically binds” and “specific binding” refer to the binding of an antibody or other protein, polypeptide or peptide to a predetermined molecule (e.g., an antigen). Typically, the antibody or other molecule binds with an affinity of at least about 1x10 7  M' 1 , and binds to the predetermined molecule with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific molecule (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined molecule or a closely-related molecule. 
 Examples of Ligand units include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein. 
 In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a Cell Binding Agent that binds to an extracellular target on a cell. Such a Cell Binding Agent can be a protein, polypeptide, peptide or a nonpeptidic agent. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a cyclic polypeptide. The Cell Binding Agent also may be antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). 
 Peptides 
 In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4-30, preferably 6-20, contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment, it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound. 
 In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin α ν β 6 . The peptide may be selective for α ν β 6  over XYS. 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV-Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV-Cys has the sequence: NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC. Alternatively, a variant of the A20FMDV-Cys sequence may be used wherein one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten amino acid residues are substituted with another amino acid residue. Furthermore, the polypeptide may have the sequence 
 NAVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXRTC. 
 Antibodies 
 The term “antibody” herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies {e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003) Jour, of Immunology 170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immuno Biology, 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a fulllength immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g. IgG 1, lgG2, IgG3, lgG4, IgA1 and lgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin. 
 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 , and scFv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler etal (1975) Nature 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, US 4816567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system (Lonberg (2008) Curr. Opinion 20(4):450-459). 
 The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (US 4816567; and Morrison et al (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include “primatized” antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences. 
 An “intact antibody” herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more “effector functions” which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1 q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR. 
 Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different “classes.” There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into “subclasses” (isotypes), e.g., lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA, and lgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. 
 Humanisation 
 Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non-human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed “humanisation”. 
 A humanized antibody refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region, preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain, has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein, preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression humanized antibodies includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region (CDR) amino acid residues and/or one or more framework region (FW or FR) amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non-human antibodies. The expression humanized antibody also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin. 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Or, looked at another way, a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non-natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and/or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulins. 
 There are a range of humanisation techniques, including ‘CDR grafting’, ‘guided selection’, ‘deimmunization’, ‘resurfacing’ (also known as ‘veneering’), ‘composite antibodies’, ‘Human String Content Optimisation’ and framework shuffling. 
 CDR grafting 
 In this technique, the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, camel, bovine, goat, or rabbit having the desired properties (in effect, the non-human CDRs are ‘grafted’ onto the human framework). In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues (this may happen when, for example, a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding). 
 Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus, in general, a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one, and in one aspect two, variable domains, in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), or that of a human immunoglobulin. 
 Guided selection 
 The method consists of combining the V H  or V L  domain of a given non-human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human V H  or V L  library and specific human V 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VHxVL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology (N.Y.) 12, (1994) 899-903. 
 Composite antibodies 
 In this method, two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required, T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by, exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008/0206239 A1. 
 Deimmunization 
 This method involves the removal of human (or other second species) T-cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody (or other molecule). The therapeutic antibodies V-region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II- binding motifs by, for example, comparison with databases of MHC-binding motifs (such as the motifs database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au). Alternatively, MHC class II- binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 249 244-250 (1995)); in these methods, consecutive overlapping peptides from the V-region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides, such as amphipathicity, Rothbard motifs, and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes. 
 Once potential second species (e.g. human) T-cell epitopes have been identified, they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T-cell epitope itself, but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein (and therefore, may not be adjacent in the primary structure). Most typically, the alteration is by way of substitution but, in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate. 
 All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology, so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However, the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible. 
 Resurfacing 
 This method involves: 
 (a) determining the conformational structure of the variable region of the nonhuman (e.g. rodent) antibody (or fragment thereof) by constructing a three-dimensional model of the non-human antibody variable region; 
 (b) generating sequence alignments using relative accessibility distributions from x-ray crystallographic structures of a sufficient number of non-human and human antibody variable region heavy and light chains to give a set of heavy and light chain framework positions wherein the alignment positions are identical in 98% of the sufficient number of non-human antibody heavy and light chains; 
 (c) defining for the non-human antibody to be humanized, a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues using the set of framework positions generated in step (b); 
 (d) identifying from human antibody amino acid sequences a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues that is most closely identical to the set of surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c), wherein the heavy and light chain from the human antibody are or are not naturally paired; 
 (e) substituting, in the amino acid sequence of the non-human antibody to be humanized, the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c) with the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues identified in step (d); 
 (f) constructing a three-dimensional model of the variable region of the non-human antibody resulting from the substituting specified in step (e); 
 (g) identifying, by comparing the three-dimensional models constructed in steps (a) and (f), any amino acid residues from the sets identified in steps (c) or (d), that are within 5 Angstroms of any atom of any residue of the complementarity determining regions of the non-human antibodt to be humanized; and (h) changing any residues identified in step (g) from the human to the original nonhuman amino acid residue to thereby define a non-human antibody humanizing set of surface exposed amino acid residues; with the proviso that step (a) need not be conducted first, but must be conducted prior to step (g). 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 Superhumanization 
 The method compares the non-human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non-human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally, the non-human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005/079479 A2. 
 Human String Content Optimization 
 This method compares the non-human (e.g. mouse) sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content (HSC) that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC/T-cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants (described in Molecular Immunology, 44, (2007) 1986-1998). 
 Framework Shuffling 
 The CDRs of the non-human antibody are fused in-frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in Methods 36, 43-60 (2005). 
 Examples of cell binding agents include those agents described for use in

 The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) sequence (Dennis et al. (2002) “Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins” J Biol Chem. 277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746). Antibodies of the invention include fusion proteins with ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002) J Biol Chem. 277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; (ii) US 2004/0001827 at [0076]; and (iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, and all of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 In one embodiment, the antibody has been raised to target specific the tumour related antigen α ν β 6 . 
 The cell binding agent may be labelled, for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate, or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope. 
 The cell binding agent is connected to the linker. In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is connected to A, where present, of the linker. 
 In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a thioether bond. 
 In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through a disulfide bond.

 In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an amide bond. 
 In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is through an ester bond. 
 In one embodiment, the connection between the cell binding agent and the linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the cell binding agent and a maleimide group of the linker. 
 The cysteine residues of the cell binding agent may be available for reaction with the functional group of R L  to form a connection. In other embodiments, for example where the cell binding agent is an antibody, the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of R L . 
 The cell binding agent may be labelled, for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate, or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope. 
 Drug loading 
 The drug loading is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent, e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines, drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, i.e. where 1,2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjgates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines, drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, although an upper limit of 40, 20, 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjgates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 80, 1 to 40, 1 to 20, 1 to 10 or 1 to 8. 
 The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV, reverse phase HPLC, HIC, mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 140 of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 
 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates. 
 For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p >5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. 
 Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: 
 (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate (D-L) or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification. 
 Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 141 reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut’s reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by engineering one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). US 7521541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids. 
 Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) Blood 114(13):2721-2729; US 7521541; US 7723485; W02009/052249). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC. 
 Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a druglinker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1,2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody. 
 Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 142 moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues. 
 In one embodiment, the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8, 2 to 8, 2 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8. 
 In some embodiments, there is one dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine group per cell binding agent.

 While it is possible for the conjugate compound to be used (e.g., administered) alone, it is often preferable to present it as a composition or formulation. 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 149 
 In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition (e.g., formulation, preparation, medicament) comprising a conjugate compound, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. 
 In one embodiment, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one conjugate compound, as described herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients, adjuvants, fillers, buffers, preservatives, anti-oxidants, lubricants, stabilisers, solubilisers, surfactants (e.g., wetting agents), masking agents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, and sweetening agents. 
 In one embodiment, the composition further comprises other active agents, for example, other therapeutic or prophylactic agents. 
 Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, New York, USA), Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2nd edition, 1994. 
 Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one [ 11 C]-radiolabelled conjugate or conjugatelike compound, as defined herein, together with one or more other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. If formulated as discrete units (e.g., tablets, etc.), each unit contains a predetermined amount (dosage) of the active compound. 
 The term “pharmaceutically acceptable,” as used herein, pertains to compounds, ingredients, materials, compositions, dosage forms, etc., which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 150 diluent, excipient, etc. must also be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation. 
 The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. 
 Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound with carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the product, if necessary. 
 The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate, delayed, timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof. 
 Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which the active ingredient is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or other microparticulate). Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient. Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Typically, the concentration ofthe active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 pg/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 pg/ml. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. 
 Dosage 
 It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the conjugate compound, and compositions comprising the conjugate compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 151 therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in combination, the severity of the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition, general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects. 
 Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician. 
 In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg (more typically about 1 pg to about 10 mg) per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately. 
 In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 mg, 3 times daily. 
 In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 150 mg, 2 times daily. 
 In one embodiment, the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 200 mg, 2 times daily. 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 152 
 However in one embodiment, the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 50 or about 75 mg, 3 or 4 times daily. 
 In one embodiment, the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime: about 100 or about 125 mg, 2 times daily. 
 The dosage amounts described above may apply to the conjugate (including the PBD moiety and the linker to the antibody) or to the effective amount of PBD compound provided, for example the amount of compound that is releasable after cleavage of the linker. 
 For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 pig/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 pig/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by additional doses every week, two weeks, or three weeks of an ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. 
 Treatment 
 The term “treatment,” as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g., in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 153 a halt in the rate of progress, regression of the condition, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e., prophylaxis, prevention) is also included. 
 The term “therapeutically-effective amount,” as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen. 
 Similarly, the term “prophylactically-effective amount,” as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired prophylactic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen. 
 The Subject/Patient 
 The subject/patient may be an animal, mammal, a placental mammal, a marsupial (e.g., kangaroo, wombat), a monotreme (e.g., duckbilled platypus), a rodent (e.g., a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse), murine (e.g., a mouse), a lagomorph (e.g., a rabbit), avian (e.g., a bird), canine (e.g., a dog), feline (e.g., a cat), equine (e.g., a horse), porcine (e.g., a pig), ovine (e.g., a sheep), bovine (e.g., a cow), a primate, simian (e.g., a monkey or ape), a monkey (e.g., marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g., gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutang, gibbon), or a human.

 In one embodiment, the patient is a population where each patient has a tumour having α ν β 6  integrin on the surface of the cell. 
 Includes Other Forms 
 Unless otherwise specified, included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents. For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (-COO'), a salt or solvate thereof, as 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 154 well as conventional protected forms. Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (-N + HR 1 R 2 ), a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (-O'), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms. 
 Salts 
 It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge, etal., J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977). 
 For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g. -COOH may be -COO'), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na +  and K + , alkaline earth cations such a.s Ca 2+  and Mg 2+ , and other cations such as Al +3 . Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e. NH4 + ) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g. NH3R + , NH2R2 + , NHR3 + , NR4 + ). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3) 4   + . 
 If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g. -NH 2  may be -NH 3   + ), then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion. Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous. 
 Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulfonic, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, glucheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic,

Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose. 
 Solvates 
 It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term “solvate” is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent. If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc. 
 Carbinolamines 
 The invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety, which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol (R A OH, where R A   
 
 
 R A OH 
 
 These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD. The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found, as well as the nature of the moiety itself. 
 These particular compounds may be isolated in solid form, for example, by lyophilisation. 
 Isomers 
 Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, atropic, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and l-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and β-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchairforms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as “isomers” (or “isomeric forms”). 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 156 
 Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term “isomers”, as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH 3 , is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH 2 OH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, metachlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. C-i_ 7  alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes η-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and paramethoxyphenyl). 
 The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.

 Note that specifically included in the term “isomer” are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including  1 H,  2 H (D), and  3 H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including  12 C,  13 C, and  14 C; O may be in any isotopic form, including  16 O and  18 O; and the like. 
 Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.

 Synthesis of Drug Conjugates 
 Conjugates can be prepared as previously described. Linkers having a maleimidyl group (A), a peptide group (L 1 ) and self-immolative group (L 2 ) can be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,214,345, which is incorporated herein by reference. Linkers having a maleimidyl group (A) and a peptide group (L 1 ) can be prepared as described in WO 2009/0117531, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other linkers can be prepared according to the references cited herein or as known to the skilled artisan. 
 Linker-Drug compounds can be prepared according to methods known in the art. Linkage of amine-based X substituents (of the PDB dimer Drug unit) to active groups of the Linker units can be performed according to methods generally described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,214,345 and 7,498,298; and WO 2009-0117531, or as otherwise known to the skilled artisan. 
 Antibodies can be conjugated to Linker-Drug compounds as described in Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2003, 21, 778-784). Briefly, antibodies (4-5 mg/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37 °C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, is monitored by reaction with 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols/mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0°C and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol.

 PCT/EP2013/077695

 After 1 hour, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC is then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 pm syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation, and RP-HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker. 
 Antibodies with introduced cysteine residues can be conjugated to Linker-Drug compounds as described in International Patent Publication W02008/070593, which is incorporated herein or as follows. Antibodies containing an introduced cysteine residue in the heavy chain are fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). Following a 1 hour incubation at 37°C, the reaction is cooled to 22°C and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid is added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides, while leaving the introduced cysteine in the reduced state. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 3.7) and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22°C. The pH of the solution is then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO is placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker, the antibody itself is first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33% (e.g., if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume, 30 mL of propylene glycol was added). This same volume of propylene glycol (30 mL in this example) is added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing, the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol is added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation; the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50%. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of Nacetyl cysteine. The ADC is purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. (Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD, as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media.) 
 For halo-acetamide-based Linker-Drug compounds, conjugation can be performed generally as follows. To a solution of reduced and reoxidized antibodies (having introduced cysteines in the heavy chain) in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTPA is added 0.5 volumes of propylene glycol. A 10mM solution of acetamide-based 
 WO 2014/096365 
 PCT/EP2013/077695 
 170 
 Linker-Drug compound in dimethylacetamide is prepared immediately prior to conjugation. An equivalent amount of propylene glycol as added to the antibody solution is added to a 6-fold molar excess of the Linker-Drug compound. The dilute Linker-Drug solution is added to the antibody solution and the pH is adjusted to 8-8.5 using 1 M Tris (pH 9). The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed for 45 minutes at 37° C. The conjugation is verified by reducing and denaturing reversed phase PLRP-S chromatography. Excess Linker-Drug compound is removed with Quadrasil MP resin and the buffer is exchanged into 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCI, and 5% propylene glycol using a PD-10 desalting column.

 The glucuronide linker intermediate S1 (reference: Jeffrey et al., Bioconjugate Chemistry, 
 2006, 17, 831-840) can be treated with diphosgene in dichlroromethane at -78°C to afford the glucuronide chloroformate, which is then reacted with the PBD dimer S2 dissolved in CH 2 CI 2  by dropwise addition. Warming the reaction to 0°C over 2 hours followed by extraction will yield the compound S3. Treating a solution of S3 in an equal solvent mixture of MeOH, tetrahydrofuran, and water (cooled to 0°C) with lithium hydroxide monohydrate for 4 hours, followed by reaction with glacial acetic acid will yield the compound S4.

 (f) Imine reduction 
 A solution of Super-Hydride® (95 pL, 1 eq, 1M in THF) was added dropwise to a solution of bis imine 7 (100 mg, 0.095 mmol) in THF (10 mL) at -78°C under an argon atmosphere. After 20 minutes, an aliquot was quenched with water for LC/MS analysis, which revealed that the reaction was complete, with some over-reduction towards the bis amine 10. (Observed LC: Bis-imine 7 19%, Imine-Amine 8 + 9 36%, bis-amine 10 45%; theoretical target for 1 eq of reducing agent is 7 25%, 8+9 50%, 10 25%). Water (20 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the cold bath was removed. The organic layer was extracted with chloroform (40 mL) and the combined organics were washed with water (1 x 40 mL), brine (50 mL), dried with Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. Purification by silica gel column chromatography (100% CHCI 3  to 96% CHCI 3 / 4% MeOH) improved the ratio of 8+9 to: 7 25%, 8+9 50%, 10 25% (20 mg, 25%, as a mixture).
