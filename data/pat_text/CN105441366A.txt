         7 the verticillium dahliae spore suspension of cfu/ml, every nutrition pot inoculates 50ml respectively; Processing 6 first inoculum densities is 10
         7 the verticillium dahliae spore suspension of cfu/ml, every nutrition pot 50ml, inoculating concentration after 3d is 10
         9 the ZBL-1 bacterium liquid of cfu/ml, every nutrition pot 50ml.Wherein processing 3 is contrasts, and all the other are test process.
       
 Each process 6 nutrition pots above, the cotton seedling of each nutrition pot 10 strain, results averaged. 
 After verticillium dahliae inoculation 20d, observe the incidence of cotton seedling. 
 Disease index calculation formula: 
 Disease index=100 × ∑ (diseased plant number at different levels × typical value at different levels)/(investigating total strain number × 4) 
 Prevention effect calculation formula: 
 Prevention effect (%)=(contrast disease index-process disease index)/contrast disease index × 100% 
 Table 6ZBL-1 is to the indoor pot prevention effect of cotton verticillium wilt 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As shown in Table 6, in indoor pot experiment, the bacterial strain ZBL-1 filtered out is 73.0% to the prevention effect of cotton verticillium wilt, and pot test effect is see accompanying drawing 5, and known Methylotrophic genus bacillus ZBL-1 has good prevention effect to cotton verticillium wilt. 
 
 
 Embodiment seven, Methylotrophic genus bacillus (Bacillusmethylotrophicus) ZBL-1CGMCCNo.11636 are to the field efficacy of cotton verticillium wilt 
 Adopt field test method to measure Methylotrophic genus bacillus ZBL-1 to the antagonism of verticillium dahliae, concrete steps are as follows: 
 (1) ZBL-1 28 DEG C of shaken overnight in LB nutrient solution are cultivated 2d, being diluted to concentration is 10
         9 cfu/ml, in cotton verticillium wilt early period of origination June 1, June 5, June 10, trench digging fills with Shi Sanci continuously, and every strain cotton is filled with at every turn and executes 500ml nutrient solution, as test group.
       
 (2) doubly contrast as medicament using 50% derosal 1000, if the contrast of blank clear water, every plot area is 10m
         2 , often process three repetitions, disease index calculation formula reference embodiment six, results averaged.
       
 Experimental plot is Infected Field, and morbidity is serious, even; Disease index before record dispenser, 7d, 14d, investigation disease index after three medicines, statistics prevention effect.Control group is clear water contrast in table 7, and derosal group and ZBL-1 group are treatment group.
