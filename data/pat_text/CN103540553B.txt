 Choosing the bacterium amount that connects (milk-acid bacteria %: yeast %) is respectively 2:6,3:5,4:4,5:3,6:2, cultivation and fermentation temperature is 26 DEG C, 28 DEG C, 30 DEG C, 32 DEG C, 34 DEG C, fermentation time is 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h, and sugared addition is 4g, 6g, 8g, 10g, 12g; Carry out single factor test fermentation test, carry out single factor exploration by mensuration alcoholic strength, acidity, pol index. 
 1. difference connects the impact of bacterium amount on zymamsis 
 Table 1 difference connects the impact of bacterium amount on zymamsis 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Saccharomycetic content be affect zymamsis important factor it.As shown in Table 1, when the ratio shared by yeast is less, the ethanol content of fermented liquid is lower.Alcohol accumulation volume raises with the increase adding yeast ratio, be 3:5 when connecing bacterium amount (milk-acid bacteria %: yeast %) ratio, the ethanol content of fermented liquid is the highest, pol and acidity are all lower, illustrate that a large amount of sugar and acid have all changed into alcohol, therefore select to meet bacterium amount (milk-acid bacteria %: yeast %) ratio 3:5 the most appropriate. 
 2. different fermentations temperature is on the impact of zymamsis 
 Table 2 different fermentations temperature is on the impact of zymamsis 
 
 
 
 The growth and breeding of temperature to thalline has a great impact, and only could grow in suitable temperature range and play fermentative action.According to the literature, leavening temperature is the principal element affecting fruit wine local flavor.Can find out according to table 2, when temperature is 30 DEG C, fermented liquid ethanol content reaches and is up to 1.2% (V/V), but when temperature too high more than 30 DEG C time, breeding and the metabolic capacity of yeast decline on the contrary, the accumulation of alcohol also reduces gradually, therefore selects 30 DEG C to be optimum fermentation temp the most. 
 3. the different fermentations time is on the impact of zymamsis 
 The table 3 different fermentations time is on the impact of spilling essence fermentation 
 
 
 
 Along with the prolongation of fermentation time, yeast fully grows, and alcoholic strength also raises gradually.As shown in Table 3, for being a flex point during 72h when fermenting, the ethanol content of 24h to 72h indirect fermentation liquid raises gradually, and when fermenting when 72h to 120h, the alcohol accumulation volume of fermented liquid obviously reduces, and therefore selects fermentation time to be 72h. 
 4. different sugar addition is on the impact of zymamsis 
 Table 4 different sugar addition is on the impact of zymamsis 
 
 
 
 The fermentation capacity of bacterial strain strengthens along with the increase of carbon source within the specific limits, adding sucrose is that yeast and milk-acid bacteria provide abundant carbon source, enhance the fermentation capacity of bacterial strain, make the ethanol content of fermented liquid, pol, acidity is all higher than former groups of single factor experiment results.As shown in Table 4, when sugaring amount is between 4-8g/100mL, alcoholic strength accumulation volume increases gradually, but when sugaring amount is more than 8g/100mL, fermentation capacity, gently parallel downward trend may be too high because add sucrose content, the sugared excessive concentration in horse Ruzhong, inhibit the fermentation of yeast and milk-acid bacteria, thus alcoholic strength is declined, pol and the higher reason of acidity.Therefore, comprehensive above reason selects sugaring amount to be that 8g/100mL is the most appropriate.

 Embodiment six: the acetic fermentation condition acetic fermentation single factor experiment of preparation horse vinegar 
 Access a certain amount of acetic bacteria in alcohol fermentation liquid, and detect fermented liquid acidity from 2d. 
 Choose that yeast connects bacterium amount (4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%), initial alcohol degree (5% (V/V), 6% (V/V), 7% (V/V), 8% (V/V), 9% (V/V)), leavening temperature (24 DEG C, 27 DEG C, 30 DEG C, 33 DEG C, 36 DEG C), fermentation time (2d, 3d, 4d, 5d, 6d) four factors carry out acetic fermentation single factor experiment respectively.
