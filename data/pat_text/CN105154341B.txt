It can be seen that influence of the glucose amount to melanin production is big in Fig. 7, and yeast extract is comparatively gentle, illustrates in the two
Between influence of the yeast extract to melanin production it is smaller.By attached drawing 8 it is recognised that loadings become the response surface of melanin production
Change becomes apparent from, and variation range is bigger, on the contrary, yeast extract variation is more gentle, from the contour of loadings and the friendship of reference axis
Point is more it is also seen that loadings are with respect to yeast extract, is affected to melanin production, and contour is oval, extreme value
Corresponding point illustrates there is very strong reciprocation between two factors close to the center of ellipse.From attached drawing 9 as can be seen that glucose
There is certain reciprocation with both loadings, but contour is almost circle, illustration is not very strong. 
 In conjunction with analysis of regression model result it is found that best technological condition for fermentation are as follows: the amount of adding is 100mL, glucose
10.3g/L, yeast extract 2.02g/L, ammonium sulfate 2.0g/L, NaCl 0.5g/L, inoculum concentration 2mL, 30 DEG C, 180r/min shakes
Bed culture 96h.By experimental verification, the theoretical extraction rate of melanin with this condition are as follows: 0.57g/L, actual production are up to
0.53g/L.Therefore, the optimum extraction process data that Responds Surface Methodology is optimized are true and reliable. 
 
 
 Embodiment five: the physicochemical property of melanin
