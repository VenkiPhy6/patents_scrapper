 VH and VL district can Further Division be super variable region, is called " complementary determining region " (" CDR "), between be dispersed with more conservative region, be called " framework region " (FR).The scope of FR and CDR has and clear and definite to define (see, Kabat, E.A., Deng (1991) SequencesofProteinsofImmunologicalInterest, FifthEdition, USDepartmentofHealthandHumanServices, NIHPublicationNo.91-3242; Chothia, C. etc. (1987) J.Mol.Biol.196:901-917).Used herein is Kabat definition.Each VH and VL is made up of three CDR and 4 FR usually, arranges in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 from aminoterminal to carboxyl terminal. 
 " immunoglobulin domains " refers to from the variable of immunoglobulin molecules or constant domain.Immunoglobulin domains usually containing two by about seven β chains, folding (such as, see, A.F.WilliamsandA.N.Barclay (1988) Ann.RevImmunol.6:381-405) of a conservative disulfide formation." immunoglobulin variable domain territory sequence " refers to the structure that can be formed and be enough to the CDR sequence in conformation is positioned to the combination of applicable antigen.Such as, described sequence can comprise all or part of aminoacid sequence of natural variable domain.Such as, this sequence can omit one, two or multiple N-or C-end amino acid, internal amino acid; Can be comprised one or more insert or additional end amino acid; Or can be comprised other change.In one embodiment, the polypeptide comprising immunoglobulin variable domain territory sequence can form target integrated structure (or " antigen binding site ") with another immunoglobulin variable domain territory sequence association, such as, can carry out interactional structure with VLA-1. 
 VH or the VL chain of described antibody may further include all or part of of heavy chain or constant region of light chain, thus forms heavy or light immunoglobulin chain respectively.In one embodiment, described antibody is the limbs of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains.Wherein weigh and can be connected by disulfide bond with light immunoglobulin chain.CH generally includes three constant domain, CH1, CH2 and CH3.Constant region of light chain generally includes CL domain.The binding structural domain with AI is contained in the variable region of heavy chain and light chain.The general mediate antibody in constant region of antibody and the combination of host tissue or the factor, comprise the first composition (C1q) of immune various kinds of cell (such as, effector lymphocyte) and classical complement system. 
 One or more region of antibody can be people, effect are people (effectivelyhuman) or humanized.Such as, one or more region of variable region can be that people or effect be people.Such as, one or more CDR, such as HCCDR1, HCCDR2, HCCDR3, LCCDR1, LCCDR2 and LCCDR3 can be people.Each light chain CDR can from people.HCCDR3 can from people.One or more framework region, FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 of such as HC or LC can be people.In one embodiment, whole framework region is people, such as, derive from the somatic cell of people, such as, can produce hematopoietic cell or the non-hematopoietic cell of immunoglobulin.In one embodiment, human sequence is by the Germline sequences (germlinesequence) of such as germline nucleic acid coding.One or more constant region can be people, effect are people or humanized.In another embodiment, framework region (such as FR1, FR2 and FR3 entirety; Or FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4 are overall) at least 70,75,80,85,90,92,95 or 98% or whole antibody can be people, effect are people or humanized.Such as, the overall and sequence of the people of people's germline fragment coding of FR1, FR2 and FR3 has at least 70,75,80,85,90,92,95,98 or 99% identical, or identical. 
 " effect being people " immune globulin variable region is such immune globulin variable region, and it comprises people's framework amino acid positions of sufficient amount, and therefore this immune globulin variable region will cause immunogen to react in normal human." effect being people " antibody is the human amino acid site comprising sufficient amount, the antibody that therefore will immunogen be caused in normal human to react. 
 " humanization " immune globulin variable region is by the immune globulin variable region of modified, therefore the immunoreation that causes in human body of the form of this modified is less than unmodified form, such as through modifying the people's framework amino acid positions containing sufficient amount, thus this immune globulin variable region can not cause immunogen to react in normal human.Such as United States Patent (USP) 6407213 and 5693762 is comprised to the description of " humanization " immunoglobulin.In certain situation, Humanized immunoglobulin can be included in an inhuman source aminoacid on one or more framework amino acid positions. 
 Anti-VLA-1 antibody can also be chimeric antibody, such as, by carry out through engineering approaches generation to relevant (such as, mice, rat or rabbit) antibody.Such as, can be made associated antibodies by recombinant DNA technology and change, the part or all of hinge region of heavy chain and/or light chain and/or constant region replaced by the tie element in the antibody from another species (such as, people).In general, the variable domains of engineered antibody also keeps identical with the variable domains of associated antibodies or substantially identical.This engineered antibody is called chimeric antibody, when the species giving its hinge and/or constant region to originate individual (such as, people), lower than the antigenicity of associated antibodies.The method preparing chimeric antibody is well known in the art.Preferred constant region includes, but are not limited to the constant region deriving from IgG1 and IgG4. 
 The exemplary anti-VLA-1 antibody that may be used for method described herein comprises, such as monoclonal antibody AJH10 (ATCCPTA-3580; Be deposited in American type culture collection, 10801UniversityBoulevard, Manassas, VA20110-2209 August 2 calendar year 2001), hAQC2 (ATCCPTA-3275; Calendar year 2001 preservation on April 18), haAQC2 (ATCCPTA-3274; Calendar year 2001 preservation on April 18), hsAQC2 (ATCCPTA-3356; Calendar year 2001 preservation on May 4) and mAQC2 (ATCCPTA-3273).All these antibody have all carried out preservation according to budapest treaty.Other anti-VLA-1 antibody comprises, the monoclonal antibody 1B3 (ATCCHB-10536) such as, described in United States Patent (USP) 5391481 and 5788966 and monoclonal antibody Ha31/8. 
 
 the preparation of antibody 
 
 The antibody be combined with VLA-1 can be prepared in several ways, comprise and such as inoculating with animal, or the in vitro method resemble phage display.Can using all or part of VLA-1 as immunogen or as target molecule when selecting.Such as, VLA-1 or its fragment, all or part of (such as the α 1-I domain) of α 1 subunit of such as VLA-1, can as immunogen.In one embodiment, the immunoglobulin that the animal be vaccinated comprises with natural, people or groups of people's immunoglobulin loci manufactures cell.In one embodiment, non-human animal contains human immunoglobulin gene at least partially.Such as, likely prepare such mice strain, its mouse antibodies produces defectiveness, but with the large fragment of people Ig locus.Utilize hybridoma technology, can produce and select from certain gene, there is required specific antigenic specificity monoclonal antibody.See, such as XENOMOUSE
         tM , Green etc. (1994) Nat.Gen.7:13-21; US2003-0070185; United States Patent (USP) 5,789,650; And WO96/34096.
       
 The non-human antibody of VLA-1 can also produce in rodent.Non-human antibody can resemble and such as carry out humanization as described in EP239400, United States Patent (USP) 6602503,5693761 and 6407213; Go immunity; Or being modified in effect through other method is people. 
 The complementary determining region that EP239400 (Winter etc.) describes by (in particular variable district) complementary determining region (CDR) of species in antibody being substituted by another species changes antibody.Usually, utilize recombinant nucleic acid technology to replace the CDR of inhuman (such as mice) antibody for the respective regions in people's antibody, thus produce the sequence of the antibody replaced needed for coding.Can add the human constant region genetic fragment of required isotype (be generally γ type to CH, be κ type to CL), by humanized heavy chain and light chain gene, coexpression in mammalian cell produces soluble humanized antibody.Also other can be used the method for antibody humanization.Such as, other determines the three dimensional structure of antibody, and frame position is in a three-dimensional structure near the method in conjunction with determinant and immunogenic peptide sequences.See, such as WO90/07861; United States Patent (USP) 5,693,762; 5,693,761; 5,585,089 and 5,530,101; (1991) Biotechnology9:266-271 such as Tempest and United States Patent (USP) 6,407,213. 
 In some instances, directly CDR is transferred on people's framework gained antibody can be made to lose antigen-binding affinity.This is because in some associated antibodies, the specific amino acids in framework region can interact with CDR, therefore can affect the antigen-binding affinity on antibody population.In this case, in order to keep the antigen-binding activity of associated antibodies, introducing " back mutation " in the framework region of receptor antibody is key point.The conventional method carrying out back mutation is known in the art.Such as Queen etc. (the same), Co etc., Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci.USA88:2869-2873 (1991) and WO90/07861 (ProteinDesignLabsInc.) describes a kind of method comprising two committed steps.First, good protein sequence homologies is had to select people V framework region by computer analysis to the V district framework of relevant mouse antibodies.Then, utilize the quarternary structure of computer to described mice V district to carry out modeling, interactional framework amino acid residues may be had with mice CDR to observe, subsequently these mouse amino acid residues are added on homology people framework.For this two-step method, design humanized antibody has several criterion.First criterion has the framework of the particular person immunoglobulin of homology as people's receptor using from usual and non-human donor immunoglobulin, or using the consensus sequence framework of much people's antibody as people's receptor.Second criterion is that people's receptor residues is uncommon, and donor residues is typical for human sequence, should use donor amino acid but not receptor if on certain specific residue of framework.3rd criterion will use donor framework amino acid residue but not receptor on the position being close to CDR. 
 Can also adopt and resemble Tempest, the distinct methods described in Biotechnology9:266-271 (1991).In the method, the V district framework deriving from NEWM and REI heavy chain and light chain is respectively used to CDR and transplants, and does not introduce mouse residues in a large number.Adopt the benefit of this method to be that the three dimensional structure of NEWM and REI variable region is learnt from X-ray crystallography, therefore can carry out modeling to the special interaction between CDR and V district Framework residues easily. 
 Total length human monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with VLA-1 can resemble and describe in (1991) J.Immunol.147:86-95 such as Boerner, utilizes external sensitization human spleen cell to produce.These antibody can also by (1991) Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci.USA88:2432-2436 or HuangandStollar (1991) J.Immunol.Methods141:227-236 such as Persson; And United States Patent (USP) 5,798, the Cook described in 230 is grand prepares.Utilize conventional phage technology, large non-seeded people phage display library also may be used for being separated and can be developed to as the high-affinity antibody of people's therapeutic agent is (such as, see, Hoogenboom etc. (1998) Immunotechnology4:1-20; Hoogenboom etc. (2000) ImmunolToday2:371-8; And US2003-0232333).Other method of preparation total length people antibody comprises and uses non-human animal, it is with the endogenous Ig loci of inactivation, the human antibody heavy chain that transgenic band does not rearrange and light chain gene.This kind of transgenic animal can inoculate by I1-I or its antigen source property fragment, then prepare hybridoma by the B cell obtained.These methods have following description, such as, relate to multinomial GenPharm/Medarex (PaloAlto, the CA) publication/patent (such as United States Patent (USP) 5789650) of the transgenic mice containing the micro-locus of people Ig; Multinomial Abgenix (Fremont, CA) publication/patent (such as United States Patent (USP) 6,075,181 relating to VENOMICE; 6,150,584 and 6,162,963; Green etc., NatureGenetics7:13-21 (1994); And Mendez etc., 15 (2): 146-56 (1997)); And multinomial Kirin (Japan) publication/patent (such as, EP843961, Tomizuka etc., NatureGenetics16:133-1443 (1997)) relating to " transomic " mice.

 ischemia injury (ischemicinjury) 
 
 Ischemia refers to and reduces or disappearance the blood supply of certain tissue.Method described herein may be used for treating the damage relevant to ischemia, or " ischemia injury ".Ischemia injury comprises the damage occurring in such as kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skeletal muscle, small intestinal, heart and brain.Ischemia injury can be relevant to following situation, or is caused by them: such as acute myocardial infarction (acutemyocardialinfarction), selectivity angioplasty (electiveangioplasty), bypass operation of coronary artery (coronaryarterybypassgraft), relate to the operation (such as, heart transplantation) of heart pass (cardiacbypass) or organ or tissue's transplanting, tissue rejection after transplanting, graft versus host disease, apoplexy, head trauma (headtrauma), drowned (drowning), sepsis (sepsis), sudden cardiac arrest (cardiacarrest), shock (shock), atherosclerosis (atherosclerosis), hypertension (hypertension), the heart disease that cocaine brings out, the heart disease of Induced By Tobacco Smoke, heart failure (heartfailure), pulmonary hypertension (pulmonaryhypertension), massive hemorrhage (hemorrhage), capillary leak syndrome (capillaryleaksyndrome) (such as child and adult respiratory distress syndrome), multiple system organ failure, low colloid oncotic pressure state (astateoflowcolloidoncoticpressure) (such as hungry (starvation), nervous anorexia (anorexianervosa) or or liver failure serum albumin production declining), anaphylaxis, hypothermia (hypothermia), cold injury (coldinjury) (such as, because cryogenic liquid perfusion (hypothermicperfusion) or cold injury (frostbite) cause), hepatorenal syndrome (hepatorenalsyndrome), tromomania (deliriumtremens), wound (acrushinjury), mesenteric vascular insufficiency (mesentericinsufficiency), peripheral blood vessel pathological changes (peripheralvasculardisease), walk lamely (claudication), burn (burn), electrocute (electrocution), the vasodilation (excessivedrug-inducedvasodilation) that overdose is brought out, the vasoconstriction (excessivedrug-inducedvasoconstriction) that overdose is brought out, radiating irradiation (such as, in the process doing fluoroscopy or radiological imaging) or contact high-energy, such as, subjected to laser and irradiate.The vasodilation that overdose is brought out can be by such as Nitroprusside (nitroprusside), hydralazone, dyazoxide, calcium channel blocker, or general anesthesia guiding drug rises.The vasoconstriction that overdose is brought out can be caused by such as neophryn (neosynephrine), isoproterenol (isoproterenol), dopamine (dopamine), dobutamine (dobutamine) or cocaine (cocaine). 
 
 ischemia reperfusion injury 
 
 After the blood flow that " ischemia reperfusion injury " refers to health a part temporarily stops, again recover (Reperfu-sion) and the damage that causes.Such as, ischemia reperfusion injury can occur in some operation processs, such as aortic aneurysm reparation and organ transplantation.Clinically, ischemia reperfusion injury can show as following complication, such as comprise the pulmonary dysfunction of adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal dysfunction, consumption coagulopathy (comprises thrombocytopenia, fibrin deposition is to microvascular architecture and disseminated inravascular coagulation), of short duration and long term spinal cord damages, arrhythmia and Acute ischemic events, comprise acute hepatocellular injury and downright bad hepatic insufficiency, gastrointestinal dysfunction (comprising massive hemorrhage and/or infarction), and multisystem organ dysfunction (multisystemorgandysfunction, or acute generalised inflammatory Distress syndrome (systemicinflammatorydistresssyndromes MSOD), SIRS).This damage can occur in the body part that blood supply is interrupted, when maybe can occur in ischemia, and the position of blood supply abundance. 
 
 apoplexy 
 
 Apoplexy is for the wide in range noun of of describing the acute cerebral insult caused due to the i or I of blood vessel.Apoplexy can be divided at least two main Types: hemorrhagic apoplexy (causing outside blood leakage to normal blood vessels) and cerebral infarction (lacking the cerebrum ischemia that blood supply causes).The event of cerebral infarction can be caused to comprise thrombosis, thromboembolism and systemic Low perfusion (and consequent ischemia and anoxia). 
 Due to anoxia and secondary event, apoplexy can cause neuronal death and brain injury usually.Because lack blood supply or other infringement and the brain region of death is called as infarction.In some cases, therapy described herein can being utilized, making the area of infarction reduce or minimize by such as reducing the secondary event causing neuronal death or damage. 
 The thrombosis that cerebral arteries wall builds up cause large cerebral thrombosis be commonly referred to the obstacle of arteriae cerebri.In cerebral embolism, the inaccessible material of arteriae cerebri is hindered to appear at sanguimotor downstream (such as, thromboembolism is brought to cerebral arteries by heart).Because differentiate apoplexy be by thrombosis or thromboembolism cause very difficult, just comprise the apoplexy of this two type with noun thromboembolism.Systematicness Low perfusion can be declined by blood flow, packed cell volume declines, blood pressure is low or heart can not cause by pump blood fully. 
 Thrombolytics, such as tissue-typed plasminogen activator (t-PA) was once used to treatment thromboembolism type apoplexy.These molecules are by causing the thromboembolism of ischemia to fall to play a role.This kind of medicine it is believed that and the most effectively gives as early as possible after Acute Stroke (preferably within 3 hours), to recover the cerebral blood flow of ischemic area at least partly and to maintain neuronic activity.Can thrombolytics be replaced with VLA-1 antagonist or combine with thrombolytics giving, thus bring the help in treatment to the study subject that there occurs thromboembolic stroke. 
 Because thrombolytics can worsen bleeding, they are prohibited for hemorrhagic apoplexy.But VLA-1 antagonist also can provide therapeutic benefit for hemorrhagic apoplexy. 
 In addition, VLA-1 antagonist can give as preventative apoplexy therapy, or TIA occurs as a part for therapy or demonstrates the study subject of TIA symptom.If the Symptoms last of apoplexy less than 24 hours, study subject has recovered completely, this study subject is considered to live through transient ischemic attack (TIA).The symptom of TIA comprise language, vision, sensation or motor capacity temporary impaired.Because TIA is often considered to the prelude of comprehensive apoplexy, the study subject suffering from TIA is the object receiving preventative apoplexy therapy, such as, give separately VLA-1 antagonist; Such as, or with another kind of medicament, anticoagulant (such as coumarin and heparin) or anti-platelet agents (such as aspirin and ticlopidine (ticlopidine)) are combined and are given. 
 
 other apoplexy therapy 
 
 Apoplexy therapy can comprise use one or more VLA-1 antagonist, this antagonist can with one or more apoplexy therapy conbined usage.These therapies can give simultaneously, also can give respectively, such as, in the time of specific interval, such as, in same 48,24,12,6,2 or 1 hours.In addition, treatment can adopt different administering modes. 
 Can comprise with the treatment of VLA-1 antagonist combination administration: thrombolytics (such as, streptokinase, acetylizad plasminogen-streptokinase activation factor complex (APSAC), urokinase, single chain urokinase type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator (scu-PA), anti-inflammatory agent, thrombin-like enzyme from snake venom, the such as bioactive variants of ancrod, thrombin inhibitor, the tissue plasminogen activator factor (t-PA) and above-mentioned substance); Anticoagulant (such as, warfarin or heparin); Antiplatelet drug (such as, aspirin); Glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor; Glycosaminoglycans; Coumarin; GCSF; Melatonin; Caspase inhibitor; Antioxidant (such as NXY-059, see Lees etc., (2006) N.Engl.J.Med354,588-600); Neuroprotective (such as, nmda receptor antagonist and cannabinoid antagonists); Anti-CD18 antibody; Anti-CD11a antibody; Anti-ICAM-1 antibody; Anti-VLA-4 antibody; Anti-TWEAK antibody; Anti-TWEAK-R antibody; Common carotid artery Endometrectomy (carotidendarterectomy); Angioplasty (angioplasty); Stenter to implant; And substituting medical science (such as, acupuncture (acupuncture), Chinese medicine (traditionalChinesemedicine), meditation (meditation), massage (massage), hyperbaric oxygentherapy (hyperbaricoxygentreatment) or behavioral guidance (conductivepedagogy)). 
 The object lesson of therapeutic alliance comprises, by VLA-1 antagonist and another kind of therapy (such as t-PA) after there is stroke symptom in study subject soon, give this object simultaneously.Second day, can start further to give study subject antiplatelet drug every day in case future again apoplexy occurs, the VLA-1 antagonist added more again was to keep the bioavailability of VLA-1 antagonist.Another example, the study subject that TIA occurred can start VLA-1 antagonist for treating immediately after making TIA diagnosis, and its dosage provides the biological effect at least one week, and then second day starts Antiplatelet therapy. 
 
 the risk factor of apoplexy 
 
 The risk factor of apoplexy may be used for differentiating that those can be given the study subject of the VLA-1 antagonist of preventive dose, or should carry out monitoring seeing if there is and need to carry out the further symptom for the treatment of with VLA-1 antagonist.In some cases, if having one, two, three or four or more kinds of such as following risk factor listed, reply study subject is treated. 
 Hypertension: hypertension (140/90mmHg or higher) is a very important risk factor of apoplexy. 
 Smoking: smoking is one of the apoplexy main and risk factor that can prevent.Nicotine in smoke from cigarette and carbon monoxide can reduce the amount of oxygen in blood.They also can damage blood vessel wall, make more may form clot.The contraceptive of some kinds is used greatly to improve the danger of apoplexy in conjunction with smoking. 
 Diabetes: the definition of diabetes records fasting plasma glucose (blood glucose) concentration 126mg/dL or higher for twice.Although diabetes are treatable, suffers from the danger that this disease can improve apoplexy.Many diabeticss have hypertension, hyperlipidemia simultaneously, overweight.These factors in addition further increase the danger of apoplexy. 
 Common carotid artery or other arterial disease: the common carotid artery on neck is responsible for blood supply in brain.The fat deposited due to arteriosclerosis makes common carotid artery narrow (speckle accumulates gradually on arterial wall), may by clottage.Common carotid artery disease is also called Jing'anpu oil field. 
 Peripheral arterial disease: what the study subject suffering from peripheral arterial disease obtained common carotid artery disease may be larger, therefore they that the danger of apoplexy occurs is higher.Peripheral arterial disease is the narrowed blood vessels of fortune blood to lower limb and arm muscles.It is caused by speckle accumulation of fat on arterial wall. 
 Atrial fibrillation can improve the danger of apoplexy.The upper ventricle of heart can not be beated effectively, but vibration, this can make blood accumulation and form clot.If clot splits, enter blood flow and rest on logical cerebripetal tremulous pulse, will apoplexy be caused. 
 Other heart disease: the study subject suffering from coronary heart disease or heart failure has higher risk of stroke than the normal people of cardiac function.The congenital heart disease of DCM (dilated cardiomyopathy) (cardiac dilatation), valvulopathy and some types also can increase the danger of apoplexy. 
 Transient ischemic attack (TIA): TIA is " warning apoplexy ", and it can produce the symptom of similar apoplexy but not have the damage of persistence.Identify TIA and carry out treating the danger that can reduce severe stroke outbreak. 
 Some hematopathys: RBC number height of eye can make blood retrogradation, more may produce clot.This point can increase the danger of apoplexy.Sickle-cell disease (being also called sickle-cell anemia) is the American heredopathias of the non-descendants of a kind of major effect.It is lower to the ability of tissue and organ that " sickleshaped " erythrocyte carries oxygen, is easily bonded in blood vessel wall, will block the tremulous pulse leading to brain, cause apoplexy. 
 Hypercholesterolemia: the total cholesterol level in blood high (240mg/dL or higher) causes a cardiopathic principal element, and heart disease can increase the danger of apoplexy.High level LDL-C (higher than 100mg/dL) and triglyceride (blood fat, 150mg/dL or higher) can increase the risk of stroke of the crowd that coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) once occurred.Low-level (lower than 40mg/dL) HDL cholesterol also can increase the danger of apoplexy. 
 Do not move and obesity: do not like motion, obesity or have both concurrently to increase the danger that hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, heart disease and stroke occur. 
 Substance abuse (excessivesubstanceabuse): drink the danger that excessive alcohol and vein drugs also can increase apoplexy. 
 Age increases: although the study subject of all age brackets, comprise child and all apoplexy can occur, and with age, the danger of apoplexy increases.Such as, danger apoplexy occurring increases more than 55,60,65,70,80 or 85 years old. 
 Sex: apoplexy in male than common in women.In most age group, there are the more of apoplexy than women in male in concrete 1 year.But it is over half that women accounts for all because of apoplexy death.The danger of pregnant woman's apoplexy is higher. 
 Heredity (family history): if father and mother, grand parents, sister or brother once apoplexy occurred, the probability of this people's apoplexy was higher.Similar, some backgrounds ethnically can cause higher risk of stroke. 
 Apoplexy or heart attack history (priorstrokeorheartattack): the probability that apoplexy occurred the study subject that apoplexy or heart attack once occur afterwards is again much higher. 
 
 stroke assessments standard

 Assessment can be carried out before or after giving VLA-1 antagonist. 
 
 traumatic brain injury 
 
 VLA-1 antagonist described herein may be used for treating traumatic brain injury.What physical external force caused is referred to as traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the injury of brain.Because the change of brain structure and/or function, the consequence of TBI causes normal brain program to change.Two kinds of basic brain injury types are Open Brain Injury and closed injury of brain.In Open Brain Injury, object (such as bullet) penetrates skull, destroys cerebral tissue.Closed injury of brain normally due to the rapid movement of head, is rocked before and after brain, has departed from skull inside and has caused.Closed injury of brain is modal in both, is normally caused by the accident or fall relating to motor vehicles.In closed injury of brain, powerful or acutely rock and damaged brain.The pressure of this rapid movement is torn and is pullled nerve fiber or aixs cylinder, has cut off the connection between brain different parts.In most cases, the clot thereupon produced or hematoma may be flushed on brain or around it, and an internal pressure is raised.Open and closed injury of brain all can produce grievous injury to brain, is therefore badly in need of medical rescue. 
 According to the type of the external force of kicking to the head, the damage of following difference can be caused: brain shakes in skull, cerebral concussion, skull fraction, contusion, subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury.Although everyone experience is different, many TBI patients can face same problem.Probability on the books comprise be difficult to concentrate one's energy, ineffective, the short-term of dealing with problems and long term memory problem and motion or sensation technical ability impaired; Even can not complete independently daily life technical ability, such as have a meal, wear the clothes or have a bath.Constitutional and secondary event are divided into for the most widely accepted viewpoint of brain injury.Primary brain be considered to generation stimulate in more or less completely, and secondary injury occurring within post-traumatic several hours to several days, also can develop. 
 Primary injury is usually relevant with emergency, such as motor-vehicle accident or any event causing the consciousness of temporarily losing or skull to break.Dampen, or the damage of similar stasis of blood green grass or young crops often appears at the position occurring to stimulate.The movement of brain in skull and rotate and cause shear property model to connection nerve fiber long in brain or axon after closed injury of brain, is called diffuse axonal injury.The tearing frontal lobe and top or blood vessel that contusion is defined as that brain rotates in skull that ridge causes.Damage can produce hematoma or clot when thin vessels is broken.Hematoma and clot can appear between skull and brain (on dura mater or subdural hematoma), or in the tolerant inside of brain (intracerebral hematoma).In arbitrary situation, if the extruding of hematoma enough metropolis or mobile brain, hurt the sensitive structure in brain stem.They also can improve the pressure in skull, finally make blood supply in brain stop. 
 People recognize that the retardance secondary injury of cellular level is the main cause organizing forfeiture after causing brain injury gradually.A series of physiology, blood vessel and biochemical event is there is in damaged tissue.This process relates to many systems, comprises neuropeptide, electrolyte (such as calcium, magnesium), excitatory amino acid, arachidonic acid metabolite (such as Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes) may change, and form oxygen-derived free radicals.This Secondary cases tissue injury is the serious long-term dysgenic basis of majority that brain injury crowd may experience.The program reducing injury may produce from rehabilitation to normal or close to normal condition, or the difference that permanent disability is such. 
 Diffusivity blood vessel injury is a major part of brain injury to have increasing evidence to show.Vascular reaction seemingly two stages.According to the order of severity of wound, early changes comprises blood pressure to start to raise, and cerebrovascular automatic adjustment is lost, and blood brain barrier (blood-brainbarrier, BBB) temporarily lost efficacy.Vascular change culminates after injury for about 6 hours, but also may continue 6 days.The clinical meaning of these Vascular changes is not clear, but may be relevant with the large Brain edema of delay, and the latter is particularly younger crowd is common. 
 The process that brain contusion produces brain necrosis is equally very complicated, also can continue several hours.Toxicity process comprises release oxygen-derived free radicals, destroys cell membrane, ion channel opens, pours in the height reactive materials that calcium ion, the release cells factor and fatty acids metabolism become may cause vasospasm and ischemia.Nearly all secondary injury all can form free radical sometime.The primary goal of free radical is the fatty acid on cell membrane.The process being called as lipid peroxidation can destroy neuron, neuroglia and vascular cell film in the mode of geometry progress.If unrestricted, lipid peroxidation can spread at surface of cell membrane, finally causes cell death.Therefore, free radical can destroy endotheliocyte, interrupt blood brain barrier (BBB) and coup injury brain cell, causes edema and neuron and neuroglial structure to change.BBB is broken and can causes cerebral edema, in brain cell is exposed to nocuity product that blood carries. 
 (outside brain) Secondary cases system injury may cause the further destruction to brain thereupon.This situation after the brain injury of all orders of severity all right and wrong usually see, if particularly relevant with multiple damage.Therefore, occur, in after brain injury several days of the crowd of brain injury, repeatedly to occur low blood oxygen, blood pressure; Heart and pulmonary's change; Fever; A series of situations such as coagulopathy and other disadvantageous changes.When there is adverse events, cerebral blood vessel can be loosened by normal regulatory mechanism, thus ensures sufficient oxygen supply, blood supply, and when this mechanism because when initial wound is impaired, just there will be these situations. 
 The scheme of immediate assessment has limitation in its efficiency and reliability, and is often intrusive mood.Computer assisted x-ray tomography (Computer-assistedtomography, CT) scanning is the standard diagnostic routines of current approved evaluation TBI, because this technology can identify many exceptions relevant to primary brain, and generally can provide, spend the relatively low (Chest122:688-7112002 such as Marik; The JournalofClinicalandExperimentalNeuropsychology23:775-79 such as McAllister 12001).But, it is different with management aspect that Different hospital uses CT scan to do diagnosis the TBI patient of feeding emergency treatment, CT scan result itself may can not indicate the neuropsychic symptom of TBI study subject well, the situation of particularly slight TBI damage BrainInjury15:489-4972001 such as () McCullagh. 
 Generally include operation to the immediate treatment of TBI and control brain or bleeding around, monitor and forecast intracranial pressure, ensures the sufficient blood supply of brain and other damage of process health and infects.Have the patient of Mild brain injury often to there are some very delicate symptoms, therefore treatment is likely delayed several days even a few week.Patient seeks medical rescue once decision, just can adopt observation, neurological detects, nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR (magneticresonanceimaging, MRI), positron tomography (positronemissiontomography, PET) scan, Single Photron Emission Computed Tomograph (single-photonemission, SPECT) scans, monitor the level of neurotransmitter in spinal fluid, computer X-ray tomography (CT) scans and X-ray determines patient's degree of injury.Type of impairment and the order of severity determine further nursing. 
 VLA-1 antagonist can treat conbined usage separately or with another kind, thus brings the help in treatment to the study subject that TBI occurs.In addition, VLA-1 antagonist can as preventative TBI therapy, or a part for therapy gives the study subject that TBI or display TBI symptom occur.Such as, VLA-1 antagonist may be used for treatment primary injury, secondary injury or both.Substitute, primary injury can be treated with VLA-1 antagonist, and as the preventative therapy of secondary injury.Can evaluate before or after giving VLA-1 antagonist. 
 
 spinal cord injury 
 
 VLA-1 antagonist described herein may be used for treating spinal cord injury.Spinal cord injury (SCI) is the destruction to spinal cord, can cause its motion normally, sensation or autonomic function that temporary transient or permanent change occurs.Clinical and experimental study all proves that, after acute SCI, spinal cord can be subject to constitutional and secondary damage.Constitutional SCI comes from the disengaging of mechanical damage, contusion, epidural pathology or neuronal components.This damage occurs usually together with the fractureing and/or misplace of spinal column.But constitutional SCI also may occur when not having spinal column to rupture or misplacing.The penetrance damage that bullet or weapon cause also may cause constitutional SCI (Burney etc., ArchSurg128 (5): 596-9 (1993)).More commonly, the osteocomma of dislocation penetrates bone marrow or causes sections spinal nerve injury.Epidural pathology also may cause constitutional SCI.Spinal epidural hematoma or abscess can cause acute spinal to be oppressed and damage.The spinal compression that metastatic carcinoma is brought is the emergency situation on a kind of common oncology.Longitudinal stretching that spinal column carries out when being with or without flexing and/or stretching, may cause constitutional SCI and rupture or dislocation without spinal column.VLA-1 antagonist may be used for the damage for the treatment of Primary. 
 The pathophysiology of Secondary cases SCI relates to cell multiplex and the molecular events (Tator, BrainPathology5:407-413 (1995)) of initial several days progress after injury.The most important cause of Secondary cases SCI is that logical myelopetal blood vessel damages, and the latter causes because impact the arteriorrhexis, arterial thrombus and the Low perfusion that cause.SCI may be caused to the ischemia that destruction or the shock of spinal artery cause.Because the SCI that ischemia causes may occur in some aortic bloods by the operation process of temporary fluid stopping.VLA-1 antagonist described herein may be used for treatment or prevents Secondary cases SCI from damaging. 
 (Tator, BrainPathology5:407-413 (1995)) that spinal cord injury also may cause due to toxicity.One of toxicity of the most significant of spinal cord injury is the injury that the Cumulate Sum of exicitatory/amino acid neurotransmitter brings subsequently.The neural information encoding that glutamine causes causes intracellular calcium concentration to raise.Then the intracellular calcium ion raised causes again Ca-dependent protease or esterase to be activated, and these enzymes cause further damage because of energy degradation of cell framework ingredient (comprising nerve) and dissolved cell film.The arachidonic acid of excessive generation and eicosanoid, such as prostaglandin may be relevant with lipid peroxidation and oxygen-derived free radicals.Ischemia after may causing Progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia wound subsequently by causing vasospasm from the vasoactive eicosanoid of impaired neuron membrane release.Endogenous opiate-like sub stance because of its to local or systemic blood circulation effect or directly act on impaired spinal cord, may also participate in secondary injury process.VLA-1 antagonist described herein may be used for the spinal cord injury for the treatment of or preventing toxicity from causing. 
 Obvious and Progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia edema may be there is after spinal cord injury.Edema itself is abrasive, or it is the attached phenomenon of other damage mechanisms (such as ischemia or glutamine toxicity), this point or unknown.In experimental model and clinical case, edema all may spread quite long distance by damage location head-end and tail end in spinal cord. 
 Can be divided into completely and forme fruste according to its degree of injury according to AmericanSpinalInjuryAssociation (ASIA) ImpairmentScale, SCI.In perfect form SCI, minimum sacrum section is not felt and motor function (Waters etc., Paraplegia29 (9): 573-81 (1991)).In incomplete SCI, below lesion level, comprise minimum sacrum section and also retain sensation and motor function (Waters etc., ArchivesofPhysicalMedicineandRehabilitation75 (3): 306-11 (1994)).Incomplete bone marrow damage may develop into damages more completely.More commonly, in several hours to several days after initial damage occurs, degree of injury improves one or two spinal levels. 
 Other classification of SCI comprises Central cord injury syndrome, the half side damage syndrome of spinal cord, front cord syndrome, conus syndrome and cauda equina syndrome.Central cord injury syndrome is often damaged relevant with neck region, and damage causes upper limb more unable than lower limb, remains with sacrum simesthesia.The half side damage syndrome of spinal cord relates to half crosspiece damage of spinal cord, cause homonymy somesthetic sensibility and loss of motor function, and offside loses the sensation to pain and temperature.Front cord syndrome often and those cause lost-motion function to some extent and the sensation to pain and temperature, and the damage remaining somesthetic sensibility is relevant.Conus syndrome is relevant with the damage of sacrum marrow and lumbar nerve roots.This is syndromic is characterised in that bladder, intestinal and lower limb areflexia, and sacrum joint shows the reflection (such as, bulbocavernosus muscle and micturition reflex) of balance once in a while.Cauda equina syndrome is because intraspinal Lumbar-sacral nerve root damages, and causes bladder, intestinal and lower limb areflexia. 
 SCI may cause neurogenic shock (Tator, BrainPathology5:407-413 (1995)).Neurogenic shock refers in acute SCI, and this group hemodynamics triplet of hypotension, bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation caused because autonomic imbalance and sympathetic nervous system control to be destroyed, it is different from spinal cord and hypovolemic shock.Hypovolemic shock is often associated with tachycardia.Spinal shock is defined as below specific plane, and comprise completely losing of all function of nervous system of reflection and rectum tension force, it is associated with autonomic imbalance.Because release catecholamine, first blood pressure can raise, and then occurs hypotension.Can be observed flaccid paralysis (comprise intestinal and bladder), develop into priapism sometimes.These symptoms often can last for a few hours to several days, until the reflex arc below lesion level restarts to play function. 
 The therapy of current SCI is intended to the motor function and the sensory capacity that improve this patient.Corticosteroid is the main force for the treatment of.Glucocorticoid, such as methyl meticortelone is believed to the secondary event reducing acute SCI, uses high dose methyl meticortelone to become the medical care Normal practice of North America in the acute SCI of non-intrusion type. 
 VLA-1 antagonist described herein may be used for SCI or its symptom for the treatment of any type described herein.VLA-1 antagonist can be used alone or with the known therapies coupling of another kind of SCI.

 After mouse peritoneal injection Ha31/8 or P1.17, mice is first used 2% isoflurane ether (isofurane) anesthesia, after this maintain in 1.0% isoflurane ether, provide oxygen by face shield.With feedback regulation type heating cushion (HarvardApparatus, Inc.Holliston, MA), rectal temperature is remained between 36.8 to 37.2 DEG C.Portion's obstruction of artery (middlecerebralarteryocclusion in the brain, MCAO) before and in process, and with PeriFlux system (PerimedInc. after Reperfu-sion, Sweden) local cerebral blood flow (regionalcerebralbloodflow, rCBF) is monitored. 
 In order to induce, there is tremulous pulse (middlecerebralartery in the middle part of brain, MCA) focal cerebral ischemia of reversible obstruction, No. 7.0 nylon monofilament stitching thread that will scribble silicon/hardener compound (HeraeusKulzer, Germany) insert right common carotid artery intracavity.Stitching thread pushes ahead 9 ± 1.0mm from insertion point through internal carotid artery, until the anterior arterial proximal of brain, it is MCA in start position total blockage.The rCBF that Doppler laser velocimeter measures shows MCA all success obturations in two groups, because rCBF drops to 20% of baseline.MCAO continue for two hours; Simultaneously by wound suture, stop anesthesia.After two hours MCA obturations, monofilament is taken out, allow reper-fusion 24 hours.Determine whether rCBF remains on previous level.Have four animals to be excluded research outside, because they are after MCAO is two hours, before Reperfu-sion, rCBF goes back up to more than 50% of previous level.All physiological parameters before ischemia, in and be all in normal range afterwards, as broad as long between two groups. 
 To after MCAO30 minute and Reperfu-sion after 24 hours in the wild the neurological deficit (neurologicdeficit) of (intheopenfield) assess respectively and give a mark.Hara etc. (1997) described this test: 
 
 
 
 Measure the volume of ischemia injury after two treated animal MCA obturations.Carry out 24 hours of reperfusion after 2 hours MCAO, execution of then being decaptitated by mice, takes out brain rapidly, is cut into the thick coronal section of 6 1mm with Mus brain section mould (mousebrainmatrix).Then by brain section in 2%2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma), room temperature lucifuge dyes 30 minutes, then is placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and spends the night.Brain section directly scans on image reading apparatus.Damage (NIHImage1.61, USNationalInstitutesofHealth) is measured in the posterior face of each section.Direct measurement is carried out to the infarct size in cortex and striatum, has then carried out revising with following formula to eliminate the impact of edema: 
 The indirect infarct size of % offside cortex= 
 [(to the non-wound area of lateral area – homonymy)/to lateral area] x100. 
 Numerical integration (numericintegration) is carried out to a series of infarct sizes comprising cortex and striatum, calculates infarction cumulative volume thus.Measurement is carried out after by slice number, make observer do not know before process.Edema is calculated as the % of ischemia side hemisphere size compared with the non-lesioned hemisphere of offside to be increased. 
 Result 
 The MCAO mice of control antibodies process has a large amount of defect at whole cerebral cortex and subcortical areas.Ischemia side hemisphere obvious tumefaction, and observe significant behavioral deficiency (such as, hemiparesis causes rotating and limb adynamia, sees Figure 1A). 
 With the mice that control antibodies (P1.17) processes maintain account for ischemia side hemisphere 47.1 ± 3.8% infarction.Obvious much little by the infarction of the mice of anti-VLA-1 antibody treatment, only account for 34.3 ± 4.2% (P<0.02 of ischemia side hemisphere, non-matching Students ' T checks, and often organizes n=12), represent that infarct size reduces by 24% (Figure 1B).With absolute volume, this equals matched group mean infarct volume 80.8 ± 6.8mm
         3 in contrast to anti-VLA-1 processed group mean infarct volume 55.63 ± 6.3mm
         3 (Fig. 1 C).Large Brain edema or edema are calculated as, and infarction hemisphere compares the percentage ratio that unmarred contralateral hemisphere hemisphere size increases.The hemisphere volume averaging of the mice that contrast (P1.17) processes increases by 18.1 ± %, and the mice that anti-VLA-1 (Ha/31/8) processes increases by 8.2% ± 1.9% (P<0.05 on hemisphere volume, non-matching Students ' T checks, n=12 weekly.Fig. 1 D).Fig. 2 shows dose response during anti-VLA-1 (Ha31/8) antibody of use three kinds of concentration, shows that the antibody of 3mg/kg is equally effective with 30mg/kg in reduction Infarction volume (Fig. 2 A) with edema.
       
 These data confirm, in the middle part of reversibility brain in obstruction of artery mouse model, suppress the neuroprotective caused by VLA-1 and antiphlogistic effects.The pathology of this model can commissarial apoplexy and other CNS ischemia injury (such as TBI and SCI) situation clinically, and available data prompting, the inhibitor of VLA-1 can have remarkable benefit to treatment these and other ischemic related conditions.
