 BACKGROUND 
 Technical Field 
 The present invention relates to a novel lactic acid bacterium isolated from Kimchi, and more specifically, relates to novel  Lactobacillus pentosus  var.  plantarum C 29 and  Lactobacillus curvatus  C3 having an activity for preventing and/or treating aging (senescence) and dementia. 
 Background Art 
 To delay an aging process is one of important health challenges in a modern society rapidly proceeding into an aging society. In Korea, the population aged 65 or more comprised 11.3% in 2010, and is anticipated to rapidly increase to 37.3%. In such the aging society, it is anticipated that a disease morbidity rate is increased and enormous medical expenses are expected, as well as it is anticipated that a rapid growth of senile disease such as dementia becomes to be problematic socially. 
 A process progressing the aging is affected by a genetic, environment, and complex action of a lifestyle, and is followed by various morphological, biochemical changes, in particular, an increase of oxidation stress and inflammation reaction are believed as a major reason involving in a promotion of aging. The oxidation stress is caused by an increase of a generation of reactive oxygen species having a strong reactivity or a reduction of an anti-oxidative defense mechanism in a body, and as a result, biomacromolecules such as DNA, etc. are destroyed, cellular damages are caused to promote the aging, and a risk of age-associated diseases, such as degenerative neuronal disease including dementia, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, etc. is increased. 
 Alder et al. (Adler A S, Sinha S, Kawahara T L, Zhang J Y, Segal E, Chang H Y. Motif module map reveals enforcement of aging by continuous NF-kappa B activity. Genes Dev. 2007;21:3244-57) proved a relevance between NF-κB activation motif and a unit regulating the aging process and thus demonstrated that the inflammation reaction mediated by NF-κB and the aging process are very closely associated with each other. In addition, it is known that the aging activates PI3K/AKT, which phosphorylates FOXO3, and ROS generation cannot be inhibited and thus a gene variation, etc. are occurred. 
 Dementia which is one of aging diseases is occurred by chronic or progressive diseases of brain, and regression, degeneration of brain tissues, and aging-central nervous system infection (neurosyphilis, tuberculous meningitis, viral encephalitis, etc.), cerebral infarction, brain damage, toxic metabolic disorder, nervous system disease (Parkinson's disease) and the like, have been known to be a major reason for causing the dementia. Dementia includes Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other mixed forms, 50˜60% of old dementia patients aged 65 or more have Alzheimer's dementia and remaining 10˜15% of them have the mixed forms of such two (2) diseases. It is known that a waste in brain, β-amyloid (Aβ) is a major cause of the disease of Alzheimer-type dementia, and many drugs have been attempted for treating Alzheimer-type dementia but there are no drug proving its significant effects. Only acetylcholinesterease inhibitor which acts in acetylcholine, is used as a treating agent, but it is known that it partially exhibits an improvement of a cognitive function but does absolutely no action in proceeding of Alzheimer's disease. And thus, there is a need for a development of the effective agent for preventing or treating dementia. 
 Meanwhile, lactic acid bacteria have been used for a long time and their intestinal regulations, anticancer effects, immune boost effects and the like have been reported. Therefore, inventors of the present invention had been studied for searching lactic acid bacteria having beneficial effects in aging and dementia, and as a result, confirmed that novel lactic acid bacteria isolated from Kimchi have effects for preventing or treating aging and dementia and then completed the present invention.

 The  Lactobacillus pentosus  var.  plantarum  C29 of the present invention is a strain belonging to lactobacillus in a molecular phylogenetic systematic and biochemical characteristic analysis based on 16s rDNA base sequence and was identified as the strain exhibiting a high level of the molecular phylogenetic systematic relationship with both of  Lactobacillus pentosus  and  Lactobacillus plantarum,  but since its biochemical characteristics were more similar to those of  Lactobacillus pentosus,  it was called as  Lactobacillus pentosus  var.  plantarum  C29, and deposited, in compliance with the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure, on the International Depository Authority, Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (“KCCM”) as a Deposit No. KCCM1129P, on Jul. 9, 2012. The deposit was accepted as viable on Apr. 10, 2015. KCCM has an address of 361-221, Yurim B/D, Hongje-1-dong, Seodaemun-gu, SEOUL 120-091, Republic of Korea. 
 In addition, since the  Lactobacillus curvatus  C3 of the present invention is a strain belonging to lactobacillus in the molecular phylogenetic systematic analysis based on 16s rDNA base sequence, and was identified as the strain belonging to  Lactobacillus curvatus,  and thus, it was called as  Lactobacillus curvatus  C3, and deposited on the International Depository Authority, KCCM as a Deposit No. KCCM43009, on Jul. 9, 2012. 
 The  Lactobacillus pentosus  var.  plantarum  C29 (hereinafter, also referred to as “C29”) and the  Lactobacillus curvatus  C3 (hereinafter, also referred to as “C3”) of the present invention were identified as having effects on improving a memory of mice by a passive avoidance response test using an animal model, mouse with Alzheimer's disease when the C29 strain or C3 strain is administered, and the C29 strain was also identified as having the memory improvement effect even in a Y maze task and a water maze task, and thus, these effects on preventing and treating dementia were confirmed (See Example 2). 
 For the present invention, dementia refers to the state, in which a brain function is damaged by various reasons, and also a cognitive function such as a memory, linguistic skills, and judgments is consistently and generally lowered than ever before thereby exhibiting the negative effects in the daily life, and includes senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's dementia, Huntington's dementia, dementia induced by normal pressure hydrocephalus, dementia induced by a head injury, dementia induced by a material, and the like. 
 In addition, as the results of measuring lipid peroxides, superoxide dismutase activity, catalase activity, and glutathione concentration after administering the C29 strain or C3 strain to the mice aged 16 months for 3 months, the significant superior antioxidant effects were exhibited as compared with the mice aged 16 months administered with physiological saline for 3 months, and the decreases of the expressions of the aging-associated genes were exhibited, and thus, the antioxidant and anti-aging effects were confirmed (see Table 6 and Example 3). 
 Therefore, the  Lactobacillus pentosus  var.  plantarum  C29 and  Lactobacillus curvatus  C3 of the present invention were identified as being strains having superior effects for preventing and treating dementia and an aging.

 Example 2 
 Identification of Anti-dementia Effects 
 In order to identify lactic acid bacteria having anti-dementia effects among 30 lactic acid bacteria isolated from Kimchi and feces, an experiment was performed by using the above-described C1 to C30 strains and laboratory animals. 
 All animals used in the experiment were the male ICR-based mice (28 to 30 g), and the experiment was performed in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal (NIH publication No. 85-23). 5 and 6 laboratory animals were housed in a cage and were leaved to freely access to the food. The temperature in the cage was 23±1° C., the moisture was 60±10%, and 12 hours of day and night (07:30˜19:30) were always maintained. 
 2-1. Passive Avoidance Task Test 
 An experimental box (50×15×40 cm, electrofiable frid floor) as an experimental equipment was divided into two sections by using a partition, and it is designed so that when entering one side into the opposite side via a small entrance, the entrance was closed automatically. When an animal was put into one side of the section divided by the partition with turning on the light, it looked around followed entering into the dark section without any light, the entrance was automatically closed, immediately foot shock was made by flowing 0.25 mA of an electric current through stainless grid of a floor for one second. At the next day, the latency from the time that the laboratory animal was put into the section turning on the light to the time that the animal was passed over the dark section and then the entrance was closed was determined. The latencies until the mouse enters into the dark section like this were determined and compared for the control and test groups. The maximal limitation time was set to 300 seconds, wherein if the mouse did not enter into the dark section until over 300 seconds, the passive avoidance response latency was determined as 300 seconds. It was determined that greater the time until the animal passes over the dark section and the entrance was closed, the memory for passive avoidance through learning was well remained. 
 30 kinds of C1 to C30 lactic acid bacteria used in the experiment were administered to the animal model with dementia in a number of 1×10 10  CFU one per 1 day for 2 days. Scopolamine (0.9 mg/kg) was administered at 1 hour after the last administration of lactic acid bacteria. As a result, as can be identified in  FIG. 3 , C29 of lactic acid bacteria used in the experiment best maintained the memory for the passive avoidance and exhibited the effects superior to Tacrin (TAC, 10 mg/kg), the treating agent of dementia, and it was the order of C3, and then C24. 
 C29 lactic acid bacteria identified as having the best effects were administered to the mouse in 1×10 9  and 1×10 10  CFU one per 1 day for two (2) days. Scopolamine (0.9 mg/kg) was administered at one hour after the last administration of lactic acid bacteria. As a result, as identified in  FIG. 4 , C29 exhibited the effects in a concentration-dependent manner. 
 In addition, in order to identify the effect for improving dementia in the animal, hippocampus of a brain was isolated and was homogenized by adding 100 μg of RIPA buffer (Gibco) with protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifuging it at 4° C., 13000 rpm for 15 minutes, p-CREB, CREB, BDNF and β-actin were measured by an immunoblotting method, while the supernatant was stored at −80° C. 
 Firstly, the supernatant was taken and subjected to an electrophoresis on  SDS  10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel for an hour and a half (sample, 50 μg). The gel subjected to electrophoresis was transferred onto a nitrocellulose paper at 100 V, 400 mA for 1 hour and 10 minutes, the transferred nitrocellulose paper was blocked by 5% defatted milk for 30 minutes and then washed with PBS-Tween three times each of 5 minutes, was reacted with the first antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) as 1:100 overnight. And then, after washing it three times with each of 10 minutes, the secondly antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) was reacted as 1:1000 for 1 hour and 20 minutes. And then, it was washed three times for 15 minutes, and was developed by emitting fluorescence. As a result, as can be confirmed in  FIG. 5 , it could be determined that p-CREB and BDNF which were reduced by only the administration of scopolamine were recovered in the group administered by C29 simultaneously with scopolamine as compared with the animal groups of models with dementia administered by only scopolamine. This fact shows that C29 lactic acid bacteria have the memory improvement effect. 
 The experimental results as above described show that the C29 and C3 lactic acid bacteria exhibit the dementia improvement effect via an improvement of the memory. 
 2-2. Y-maze Task 
 A Y-maze task measuring equipment had a shape of alphabet Y extending three arms, in which all the branches had 25 cm of a length, 14 cm of a height, and 5 cm of a width, and were positioned in the same angle. A head part of the laboratory animal is headed for the end of a path of Y-maze and let it go around a passage freely for 8 minutes. After recording a movement of the animal, if hind legs of the animal entered the passage, it is considered that the animal is arm entry. The movement of the animal is represented by an alternation, which is defined that if the animal passes three (3) passages continuously, it is defined as being one alternation. An amount of a spontaneous alternation is represented by a percent of the real alternation and the maximal possible alternation (i.e., a value obtained by deducting 2 from the total alternation). 
 The C29 which is the best one of lactic acid bacteria used in the experiments was administered to the mouse in 1×10 9  and 1×10 10  CFU one per 1 day for two (2) days. Scopolamine (0.9 mg/kg) was administered at one hour after the last administration of lactic acid bacteria. 
 As a result, as can be identified in  FIG. 6 , the test group administered by the C29 exhibited the memory improvement effect in a concentration-dependent manner as compared with the control administered by scopolamine only. 
 2-3. Water Maze Task 
 To a circle type of water tank (a diameter of 100 cm and a height of 35 cm), water that was made foggy by putting dry milk so as not to see a platform equipped in water of 23° C. was filled in a depth of 15 cm. In the case of using a mouse, a platform (a diameter of 4.5 cm and a height of 14.5 cm) was placed in the center of one fan shape of 4-divided shapes of water tank so that the top of the platform is placed below 0.5 cm of the surface of water. This device was installed in the laboratory having a mark which can identify the position. A training trial was practiced three times per a day for five days in consequentially. Once the mouse found the platform, it is allowed to stay for 10 sec, and back to the original cage, and after 5 min, the next trial was practiced. If the mouse did not find the platform within 120 sec, it is allowed to stay in the platform for 10 sec, and then finished the trial. A probe test was practiced to the animal that the trial was finished at 24 hrs after the final trial. At this time, the platform was removed from the pool, and the time staying in the 4-divided circle that the platform was placed during 90 sec was measured to represent it as a percentage. 
 A swimming time was measured daily while administering the best C29 lactic acid bacteria in the amount of 1×10 9  and 1×10 10  CFU among the lactic acid bacteria used in the experiment once per day for 4 days. Scopolamine (0.9 mg/kg) was administered at 1 hour after the first administration. 
 As a result, the C29 lactic acid bacteria exhibited the memory improvement effect in a concentration-dependent manner, as can be seen in  FIG. 7 . 
 Example 3 
 Identifications of Anti-oxidation, Anti-aging and Anti-dementia Effect 
 In order to identify the anti-oxidation, anti-aging and anti-dementia effect, three lactic acid bacteria C29, C3, C24 (1×10 9  CFU, respectively) were administered for five days for 12 weeks, and the anti-aging effect of the lactic acid bacteria and aging-associated gene AKT, FOXO3, NF-KB (p65), mTorr phosphate body in a large intestine that the progress of oxidation reaction is fast, were measured. Beta-actin was measured as a comparative gene. Also, the memory improvement effect was measured. 
 1) Lipid Peroxide Analysis 
 To 100 mg of the large intestine tissue of the laboratory animal, 250 μl of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail was added to homogenate. Thereafter, it was centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C., 13000 rpm, and then the surfactant was used in the lipid peroxidation analysis while storing −80° C. 
 The lipid peroxidation degree in the large intestine tissue was analyzed by using TBARS analysis kit (Cayman chem., USA). 100 μl of homogenate of the large intestine tissue was placed in 5 ml of a polypropylene screw-cap centrifugal tube, and then 100 μl of SDS solution was added and shaken lightly. 4 ml of color reagent was added to the tube, and then put into boiling water for 1 hour to stop the reaction. Thereafter, it was centrifuged for 10 min at 4° C., 13000 rpm, and then allowed to stand for 30 min at the room temperature, and measured the absorbance at 540 nm using an ELISA reader. The standard cure was made by using malonaldehyde (MDA) as a standard material, and the amount of MDA produced from this was measured. 
 2) Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Activity 
 The Cu, Zn-SOD activity was measured by using xanthine oxidase-cytochrome C system. 2. 4 ml of 50 Mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8, containing 0.1 mM EDTA), 0.3 ml of 0.1 mM pericytochrome C, 0.2 ml of 1% deoxycholate, 0.1 ml of 1.5 mM potassium cyanate, 0.3 ml of 0.5 mM xanthine and 20 ml of xanthine oxidase were thoroughly mixed, and the reduction rate of pericytochrome C was measured at 25° C., 550 nm. 1 unit of SOD was defined as the amount to inhibit 50% reduction of cytochrome C. 
 3) Catalase Activity 
 To 2 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100 μl of an enzyme source was added, and 1 ml of 10 mM H 2 O 2  solution was added to measure the reduction of the absorbance for 2 min. 1 unit was defined as the amount of the enzyme which decomposes 1 mol H 2 O 2  for 1 min. 
 4) Glutathione (GSH) 
 A GSH concentration was measured by diluting a sample with a phosphate buffer and adding o-phthaldehyde, shaking for 15 min, and measuring the fluorescence at 345 nm of an excitation wavelength and 425 nm of a radiation wavelength. 
 As the results of four experiments as above, all 3 strains used in the experiments exhibited excellent anti-oxidation and anti-aging results, as listed in the following Table 6. The most excellent stain was C29, and then in the order of C24 and C3.

 In addition, to 100 mg of larger intestine tissue of the laboratory animal, 250 μl of RIPA buffer (Gibco) including protease inhibitor cocktail was added to homogenate. It was centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C., 13000 rpm, and then, phosphor-FOXO3, phosphor-p65, p65, phosphor-mTorr, phosphor-AKT and β-actin were measured via an immunoblotting method while storing the supernatant at −80° C. 
 The supernatant was taken and subjected to the electrophoresis in a  SDS  10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel for 1 hr and 30 minutes (sample, 50 μg). The gel subjected to the electrophoresis was transferred to a nitrocellulose paper at 100 V, 400 mA for 1 hour and 10 minutes, the transferred nitrocellulose paper was blocked with 5% defatted milk for 30 minutes and then was washed with PBS-Tween three times with each of 5 minutes, reacted with the first antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at 1:100 overnight, washed three times with each of 10 minutes, and reacted with the secondly antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) at 1:1000 for 1 hour and 20 minutes. After then, it was washed three times with each of 15 minutes, was development with emitting fluorescence. 
 The cell treated in the same method as the above method, except for treating it with the active ingredient and LPS, was used as a control. As a result, as illustrated in  FIG. 8 , it could be seen that in the test group treated with the C29 or C3, the expressions of p-p65, p-FOXO3, p-mTor, p-AKT and the like were significantly reduced as compared with the untreated group, and it showed the antioxidant or anti-aging effects by C29 or C3. 
 5) Y-maze Task 
 A Y-maze task equipment has a shape of alphabet Y extending three arms, wherein the each branch has 25 cm of a length, 14 cm of a height, and 5 cm of a width and placed with the same angle. A head part of the laboratory animal is headed for the end of a path of Y-maze and let it go around the path freely for 8 minutes. After recording a movement of the animal, when hind legs of the animal entered the passage, it is considered that the animal is arm entry. The movement of the animal is represented by alternation, which is defined that when the animal passes three (3) passages continuously, it is defined as one alternation. A spontaneous alternation is represented as a percent of the real alternation and the maximal possible alternation (i.e., a value obtained by deducting 2 from the total alternation). 
 In this task, the C29 lactic acid bacteria, C3 lactic acid bacteria and C24 lactic acid bacteria were administered to the mice aged 16 months in 1×10 9  CFU one per 1 day for two (2) days. In this task, since the memory of the aged mice was lower than that of young mice, scopolamine was not administered. 
 As a result, as can be identified in  FIG. 9 , the C29 lactic acid bacteria was the best in the memory improvement effect of the aged mouse, and then was in the order of the C3 lactic acid bacteria and C24 lactic acid bacteria. 
 6) Morris Water Maze Task 
 To a circle type of water tank (a diameter of 100 cm and a height of 35 cm), water that was made foggy by putting dry milk so as not to see a platform equipped in water of 23° C. was filled in a depth of 15 cm. In the case of using a mouse, a platform (a diameter of 4.5 cm and a height of 14.5 cm) was placed in the center of one fan shape of 4-divided shapes of water tank so that the top of the platform is placed below 0.5 cm of the surface of water. This device was installed in the laboratory having a mark which can identify the position. A training trial was practiced three times per day for five  days  6 in consequentially. Once the mouse found the platform, it is allowed to stay for 10 sec, and back to the original cage, and after 5 min next trial was practiced. If the mouse did not find the platform within 120 sec, it is allowed to stay in the platform for 10 sec, and then finished the trial. A probe test was practiced to the animal that the trial was finished at 24 hrs after the final trial. At this time, the platform was removed from the pool, and the time staying in the 4-divided circle that the platform was placed during 90 sec was measured to represent it as a percentage. 
 A swimming time was measured daily while administering the C29 lactic acid bacteria, C3 lactic acid bacteria and C24 lactic acid bacteria to the mice aged 16 months in the amount of 1×10 9  CFU once per a day for 4 days. In this test, since the memory of the aged mice was lower than that of young mice, scopolamine did not administered.

 When the rDNA base sequences were compared with each other using a BLAST similarity search program, and then, was proceeded an alignment of multiple sequences with the 16S rDNA gene sequences of various  lactobacillus  sp. Strains, and their positions were determined in a phylogenetic tree, since the C29 lactic acid bacteria exhibited at least 99.9% of homologe with  Lactobacillus plantarum  strain BIM B-536 and  Lactobacillus pentosus  strain LS3, they were named as  Lactobacillus plantarum  var.  plantarum  C29 and was deposited to the Depositary Authority, Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (“KCCM”) as a Deposit No. KCCM11291P, on Jul. 9, 2012. In addition, since the C3 lactic acid bacteria exhibited at least 99.9% of homologe with  Lactobacillus curvatus,  they were named as  Lactobacillus curvatus  C3, and were deposited to Deposit Authority, Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (KCCM) as a Deposit No. KCCM43009, on Jul. 9, 2012.

 Identification of Anti-dementia Effect of C29 or C3 Strain Fermentation Composition 
 In order to identify the anti-dementia effects of a soybean or defatted soybean fermentation composition fermented with a C29 or C3 strain, a  kalopanax  fermentation composition, a  ginseng  fermentation composition, and a  Codonopsis lanceolata  fermentation composition, a passive avoidance task test using the laboratory animals was performed in the same method as Example 2. 
 5-1. Preparation of Fermentation Composition 
 10 g of a powder of the soybean or defatted soybean was suspended in 90 ml of water and sterilized, and 10 ml of the C29 or C3 strain was added in the amount of 1×10 8  CFU/0.1 ml thereto, and then, was cultured for 24 hrs. 
 10 g of each of a water extract of  kalopanax , a water extract of  ginseng  and a water extract of  Codonopsis lanceolata  was suspended in 90 ml of water and sterilized, and 10 ml of the C29 or C3 strain was added in the amount of 1×10 8 /0.1 ml, and then,was cultured for 24 hrs. 
 5-2. Passive Avoidance Task Test 0.1 ml of each of the soybean or defatted soybean fermentation composition,  kalopanax  fermentation composition,  ginseng  fermentation composition and  Codonopsis lanceolata  fermentation composition prepared by said method was added to the dementia model, mice once per 1 day for two (2) days. Scopolamine (0.9 mg/kg) was administered at one hour after the last administration of lactic acid bacteria. As a result, as can be identified in  FIG. 12 , the soybean fermentation composition fermented by C29 maintained the best in memory for the passive avoidance and exhibited superior effect as compared with the treating agent of dementia, Tacrin (TAC, 10 mg/kg), and followed by the  ginseng  fermentation composition fermented by C29, soybean fermentation composition fermented by C3, and  Codonopsis lanceolata  fermentation composition fermented by C29 in order. It shows that the fermentation composition fermented by the C29 or C3 strain has the memory improvement effect. 
 The results of the above-described tasks show that the fermentation composition fermented by the C29 or C3 strain exhibits the dementia improvement effect by improving the memory.
