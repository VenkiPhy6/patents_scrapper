The present invention also relates to methods for transferring endophyte strains between plants.    Background of the Invention Microbes represent an invaluable source of novel genes and compounds that have the potential to be utilised in a range of industrial sectors. Scientific literature gives numerous accounts of microbes being the primary source of antibiotics, immune-suppressants, anticancer agents and cholesterol-lowering drugs, in addition to their use in environmental decontamination and in the production of food and cosmetics. A relatively unexplored group of microbes known as endophytes, which reside e.g. in the tissues of living plants, offer a particularly diverse source of novel compounds and genes that may provide important benefits to society, and in particular, agriculture. Endophytes may be fungal or bacterial. Endophytes often form mutualistic relationships with their hosts, with the endophyte conferring increased fitness to the host, often through the production of defence compounds. At the same time, the host plant offers the benefits of a protected environment and nutriment to the endophyte. Important forage grasses perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) are commonly found in association with fungal and bacterial endophytes. However, there remains a general lack of information and knowledge of the endophytes of these grasses as well as of methods for the identification and characterisation of novel endophytes and their deployment in plant improvement programs. Glycine (soybean) is a genus in the bean family Fabaceae. The best known species is the cultivated soybean (Glycine max). Again, there remains a general lack of information and  
 - 2 -knowledge of the endophytes of these plants as well as of methods for the identification and characterisation of novel endophytes and their deployment in plant improvement programs. Knowledge of the endophytes of perennial ryegrass may allow certain beneficial traits to be exploited in enhanced pastures, or lead to other agricultural advances, e.g.  to the benefit of sustainable agriculture and the environment. Identification of phylogenetically related microbes typically involves isolation of microbes from e.g. plant material and subsequent processing by genetic sequencing to allow for comparison of microbes. Microbes can then be clustered based on genetic similarities. Further methods for identification and characterization of for microbes, in particular endophytes, are generally based on morphological characterisation and molecular taxonomy analyses. Morphological characterisation includes analyses of macroscopic and microscopic structures of microbes grown on culture media. Molecular taxonomy analysis is mainly based on gene sequence analysis of spacer regions in nuclear ribosomal DNA  (nrDNA), particularly in phylogenomics. However, traditional methods of phylogenomics based on nrDNA sequences may not reflect the divergence of closely related species. There exists a need to overcome, or at least alleviate, one or more of the difficulties or deficiencies associated with the prior art. Summary of the Invention In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for profiling endophyte strains from a microbiome, said method including the steps of: providing a microbiome; obtaining protein profile spectra from one or more endophytes of the microbiome; processing the protein profile spectra; clustering the endophyte strains based on the processed protein profile spectra; and selecting and/or isolating endophyte strain(s) having desired genetic and/or metabolic characteristics, or being phylogenetically related to a desired endophyte strain. As used herein, the term 'profiling' endophyte strain(s) means identifying, characterising and/or comparing endophyte strain(s). For example, this may include selecting and/or  
 - 3 -isolating endophyte strain(s) having desired genetic and/or metabolic characteristics, or endophyte strain(s) that are phylogenetically related to a desired endophyte strain. As used herein the term 'isolated' means that an endophyte is removed from its original environment (e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally occurring endophyte present in a living plant is not isolated, but the same endophyte separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. As used herein the term 'endophyte' is meant a bacterial or fungal strain that is closely associated with a plant. By 'associated with' in this context is meant that the bacteria or fungus lives on, in or in close proximity to a plant. For example, it may be endophytic, for example living within the internal tissues of a plant, or epiphytic, for example growing externally on a plant.

The bacterial and fungal microbiome is isolated from plants, and these microbes are identified and compared using MALDI. The spectra from bacterial and fungal strains are processed using novel filtering settings to produce validated spectra that are used for hierarchical clustering. Strains occupying the same clades of the tree shown to be phylogenetically related. Applying this method allows the rapid identification of phylogenetically related microbes without the need to further process the microbes beyond their isolation, as whole colonies can be used for the MALDI spectra generation and comparison. The more time consuming and costly DNA sequencing can thus be targeted to microbes of interest.     This method can be used to specifically identify bacterial and fungal strains among a collection of isolated microbes that (i) are closely related to strains with bioactivity (e.g.  bioprotection and biofertilizer properties); (ii) are closely related to strains with broad/narrow host ranges from broad/narrow geographic ranges; (iii) are closely related to strains from plant lines with a specific phenotype (e.g. drought tolerance). Example 1 - Microbe isolation Plant material (seeds, leaves, stems, petioles, roots, buds, flowers) was harvested from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae), corn (Zea mays), Glycine species, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Seed was surface sterilised, germinated and allowed to grow for up to 14 days prior to microbe isolation. All other plant material was washed in sterile distilled water or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) up to 5 times prior to microbe isolation. The plant material was submerged in sufficient PBS to completely cover the tissues, and ground using a Qiagen TissueLyser II, for 1 minute at 30 Hertz. A 10 pl aliquot of the macerate was added to 90 pl of PBS. Subsequent 1 in 10 dilutions of the 10 -1 suspension were used to create additional 10 -2 to 10 -4 suspensions. Once the suspensions were well mixed 50 pl aliquots of each suspension were plated onto Reasoners 2 Agar (R2A) for growth of bacteria and fungi. Dilutions that provided a good separation of microbial colonies were subsequently used for isolation of individual colonies through re-streaking of single colonies from the dilution plates onto single R2A plates to establish a pure colony. Example 2 - Spectra acquisition, processing and analysis Spectra Acquisition MALDI spectra were acquired for all novel bacterial and fungal strains to determine the relatedness of each strain. The analysis acquired and compared spectra of protein profiles from each novel bacterial and fungal strain using the Bruker MALDI Biotyper system.  Single bacterial and fungal colonies of each strain were generated through streaking from glycerol stocks onto R2A plates and allowing colony growth for 48 hours.  Single bacterial and fungal colonies were applied to a Bruker MALDI Biotyper target plate using the Extended Direct Transfer (EDT) method. In the EDT method novel bacterial and fungal strains were inoculated on to two consecutive wells on the target plate (primary spot and secondary spot), treated with 70% formic acid (for up to 30 mins) and covered with HCCA     (a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) matrix solution [10 mg HCAA in 1 mL of solvent solution:  50% volume pL ACN (acetonitrile), 47.5% volume pL water, and 2.5% volume pL  TFA  (trifluoroacetic acid)]. The plate was dried at room temperature. Escherichia coil strain ATCC 25922 was included as a quality control. The target plate was analysed in a Bruker MALDI-TOF ultrafleXtreme according to manufacturer's instructions. Protein spectra were calibrated with the Escherichia coil ATCC 25922 quality control strain, and an internal standard. Automated analysis of the raw spectral data was performed by the MALDI  BioTyper automation 2.0 software (Bruker Da!tonics) using default settings.  Protein spectra were compared to MALDI BioTyper library (3,746 spectra - June 9, 2010) for preliminary identification and taxonomical assignment. Spectra Processinq The raw protein spectra from each novel bacterial and fungal strain were processed through a data deconvolution workflow in the software Refiner, GeneData. The raw spectra from each plate (i.e. Batch) were processed separately, first by aligning spectra to create a m/z grid (m/z x sample), followed by spectrum baseline subtraction to reduce background noise across the grid, and finally aligning m/z across key reference spectra from the grid (e.g. E.coli ATCC 25922) (Figure 1). Batches were then merged and processed further, first by again aligning m/z across key reference spectra (e.g. E.coli ATCC  25922) from the grid, followed by spectrum smoothing to reduce intensity jitter of putative peaks, then restricting m/z from a defined range, then detecting spectrum peaks using a resolution-based method, and finally filtering valid peaks by removing those that did not meet specific thresholds. Parameters for the data deconvolution workflow are defined in Figure 1. The resultant processed data of valid peaks and intensities was converted into a matrix for statistical analysis. Spectra Analysis The matrix was analysed in the software Analyst, Genedata. A Hierarchical Clustering analysis was conducted to compare protein spectra between novel bacterial and fungal strains. The analysis utilised the Positive Correlation (1-r) distance algorithm, with complete linkage, and only included values present in 50% of samples. A  Hierarchical Clustering tree was generated whereby novel bacterial and fungal strains clustered based on similar protein profiles.     Example 3 - Use of MALDI spectra to identify closely related bacterial strains to bioactive strains A method has been developed that uses MALDI to compare protein spectra from bioactive bacterial strains with other bacterial strains isolated from the same host plant, to identify closely related strains that may possess equivalent or superior bioactivity. A total of 600 bacterial strains were isolated from seed, leaves and roots of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The novel Xanthomonas sp. bacterial strain GW  isolated from seed was demonstrated to have bioprotectant and biofertilizer activity. The protein profiles of all bacterial strains were acquired, processed and analysed to determine their phylogenetic relatedness, including strains that were closely related to the novel bioactive Xanthomonas sp. bacterial strain GW. The novel bioactive Xanthomonas sp. bacterial strain GW clustered with 17 additional strains in the phenogram. Some of these strains were isolated from seeds, while others were isolated from leaves and roots from mature plants. These strains included SS, SI, SM, GN, X, GU, HI, GJ, GM, LK, NC, NG, GY, HA, GKc, GKb, UT. The GW containing clade of the Hierarchical Clustering tree was referred to as a Xanthomonas clade (Figure 2). An assessment of the protein spectra of Xanthomonas sp. strains (GW, SS  and SI) indicated that the profiles were highly similar, differing with respect to proteins, 3953.8004 Da!tons (unique to strain GW), 4497.4911 Da!tons (Unique to strain SS) and 12741.7201 Da!tons (Unique to strains SS and SI) (Figure 3). The 17 additional strains are candidates for further characterisation to determine if they possess equivalent or superior bioactivity. Example 4 - Use of MALDI spectra to identify bacterial strains common within a plant genera (host range) and across diverse geographic locations (geographic range) A method has been developed that uses MALDI to compare protein spectra from bacterial and fungal strains isolated from within a plant genera and from a diverse geographic locations, to identify closely related bacterial and fungal strains that (i) are specific to multiple host species from diverse locations (i.e. broad host range, broad geographic range), (ii) are specific to multiple host species from a single location (i.e. broad host range, narrow geographic range), (iii) are specific to one host species from diverse locations (i.e.     narrow host range, broad geographic range) or (iv) are specific to one host species from a single location (i.e. narrow host range, narrow geographic range). A total of 331 bacterial and fungal strains were isolated from seeds of soybean (Glycine max) and six native Glycine species (Glycine tomentella, Glycine tabacina, Glycine latifolia, Glycine hirticaulis, Glycine microphylla, Glycine clandestina). The protein profiles of all bacterial and fungal strains were acquired, processed and analysed to determine their phylogenetic relatedness.    Broad host ranqe, broad qeoqraphic ranqe A clade was identified that contained closely related Pseudomonas oryzihabitans bacterial strains, that were isolated from three Glycine species, Glycine tomentella, Glycine hirticaulis and Glycine tabacina (Figure 4). The bacterial strains were isolated across a range of locations throughout Australia ¨ Kakadu National Park (Northern Territory, NT), La Trobe University Wildlife Sanctuary (Victoria). These bacterial strains all had spectra with identical proteins, differing only in the intensity of those proteins. This clade represents closely related bacterial strains with a broad host range and from a broad geographic range.    Broad host ranqe, narrow qeoqraphic ranqe A clade was identified that contained closely related Agrobacterium larrymoorei bacterial strains that were isolated from two Glycine species, Glycine clandestina and Glycine tabacina (Figure 5). The bacterial strains were isolated from one location in Victoria ¨ La Trobe University Wildlife Sanctuary. These bacterial strains all had spectra with identical proteins, differing only in the intensity of those proteins. This clade represents closely related bacterial strains with a broad host range and from a narrow geographic range.    Narrow host ranqe, broad qeoqraphic ranqe A clade was also identified that contained closely related fungal strains (Papiliotrema sp.), that were isolated from only Glycine clandestina (Figure 6). The fungal strains were isolated across a range of locations throughout Victoria - Mornington Peninsula National Park, Cardinia Creek Parklands and Kinglake National Park: Running Creek.  These fungal strains had spectra with identical proteins, differing only in the intensity of those proteins.     This clade represents closely related fungal strains with a narrow host range and from a broad geographic range. Narrow host ramie, narrow deodraphic ramie A clade was also identified that contained closely related Sphingomonas bacterial strains that were isolated from only Glycine tomentella (Figure 7). The bacterial strains were isolated from one location, Kakadu National Park (NT). These bacterial strains all had spectra with identical proteins, differing only in the intensity of those proteins. This clade represents closely related bacterial strains with a narrow host range and from a narrow geographic range. Example 5 - Use of MALDI to identify bacterial strains exclusive to a plant phenotype A method has been developed that uses MALDI to compare protein spectra from bacterial strains isolated plant lines exhibiting different phenotypes, to identify closely related bacterial strains that are exclusive to a specific phenotype. A total of 580 bacterial strains were isolated from seeds of 11 wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines that were phenotyped as either drought tolerant or drought resistant.  The protein profiles of all bacterial strains were acquired, processed and analysed to determine their phylogenetic relatedness. A clade was identified that contained closely related Arthrobacter bacterial strains that were exclusive to the drought tolerant lines (Figure 8). These bacterial strains all had spectra with identical proteins, differing only in the intensity of those proteins.  This clade represents closely related bacterial strains that are exclusive to a plant phenotype. Finally, it is to be understood that various alterations, modifications and/or additions may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention as outlined herein. Example 6 - Profiling the Glycine Seed Microbiome The seed microbiome of Glycine CWR was compared to commercial G. max to determine similarities across the species. The core microbiome of G. clandestina was identified and compared to G. max to identify operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in (Scenario I) both Glycine CWRs and G. max, in an effort to identify strains that could be transferred from one species to another, which could potentially offer enhanced bioactivity, or (Scenario II) bacteria that were only found in Glycine CWRs that could be introduced into G. max, which could potentially offer novel bioactivity. The process was validated by isolating strains from Glycine CWRs and G. max, which were taxonomically identified and compared using MALDI-TOF MS to determine if there were strains that clustered according to Scenario I or Scenrairo II. Candidate microbes were identified that fulfilled Scenario I, and the putative identities of microbes that fulfil criteria were identified within the core microbiome of G. clandestina. Seed from Glycine max, Glycine clandestina, Glycine hirticaulis, Glycine tomentella, Glycine tabacina, and Glycine microphylla was collected across Victoria and the Northern Territory, and stored at room temperature (22-24  C). The seed were washed 10 times with excess amount of sterile distilled water in sterile conditions. All the Glycine CWR seeds were then scarified using sterile scalpel blade to initiate the process of water absorption.  Seeds of both Glycine max and CWR were germinated in large (12 cm diameter) sterile petri dishes containing three layers of sterile WhatmanTM paper (two on bottom and one layer on top of seeds). Under aseptic conditions, 10-20 seeds were placed into each dish followed by the addition of 5-7 ml of sterile distilled water. The petri dishes were sealed with ParafilmTM and incubated first for 2-3 days in dark at room temperature.  Once the seed germinated the top layer of filter paper was removed aseptically and petri dishes were then resealed with ParafilmTM allowed further to grow for 10 -12 days. Once the seedlings were of sufficient size, a total of 16 seedlings were harvested per Glycine species and per location. DNA extraction of seedlings was performed in 96-well plates using the QIAGEN MagAttract 96 DNA Plant Core Kit according to manufacturers' instructions with minor modifications for use with a Biomek FX liquid handling station. The bacterial microbiome was profiled targeting the V4 region (515F and 806R) of the 16S rRNA gene according to the IIlumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol, with minor modifications to include the use of PNA PCR blockers to reduce amplification of 16S rRNA genes sequences derived from the plant chloroplast genome and mitochondria!  genome (Wagner et al., 2016). Paired-end sequencing was performed on HiSeq3000 using a 2 x 150 bp v3 chemistry cartridge. Sequence data was trimmed and merged using PandaSEQ  (removal of low quality reads, 8 bp overlap of read 1 and read 2, removal of primers, final merged read length of 253 bp) (Massela et al., 2012). QIIME2 (release 2019.4) was used for dereplication for taxonomy assignment, removal of organelle OTUs, and statistical analysis (multivariate statistics for qualitative and quantitative OTU  analysis;  presence/absence searches for core microbiome analysis). Seed microbiomes were assessed from G. clandestina accessions collected from 6 locations across the greater Melbourne region of Victoria and compared to G.  tabacina (one accession ¨ greater Melbourne region) and G. max (one accession ¨ NSVV).       The comparison utilised Unweighted UNIFRAC Distance Principal Components Analysis, which is a qualitative assessment that utilises OTU phylogeny (Figure 8). The microbiomes of G.  clandestina and G. max were similar with replicates clustering together, particularly replicates from G. max and G. clandestina (Dandenong National Park), indicating the phylogeny of OTUs within the microbiomes were similar. The seed microbiome of G.  tabacina was different from G. max and G.clandestina forming a distinct cluster. An assessment of the core microbiome of G. clandestina identified 22 OTUs present in seed accessions from the six locations, including Stenotrophomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Holomonas sp., Enterobactereaceae sp., Pantoea sp., Burkholderiaceae sp., Ralstonia sp., Massilia sp., Herbaspirillum sp., Delftia sp., Curvibacter sp., Aquabacterium sp., Sphingomonas sp., Novosphingobium sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Ochrobactrum sp.,Methylobacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp.  and Curtobacterium sp. (Table 1). Of these, a total of 14 OTUs were also present in G. max, with these OTUs representing microbes that could potentially be transferred between the two species. In addition, there were 8 OTUs that were absent from G.max, with these OTUs representing microbes that could potentially be introduced into G. max.  These included Stenotrophomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Holomonas sp., Pantoea sp., Curvibacter sp., Aquabacterium sp., Novosphingobium sp. and Bradyrhizobium sp..

Seed was harvested by removing aerial tissue and root tissue, and discarding the seed coat. The plant tissues were submerged in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to cover the plant tissue, and ground using a sterile micropestle or Qiagen TissueLyser II, for 1 minute at 30 Hertz. A 10 pl aliquot of the macerate was added to 90 pl of PBS. Subsequent 1 in 10 dilutions of the 10-1 suspension were used to create additional 102 to 10 -4 suspensions. Once the suspensions were well mixed 20 pl aliquots of each suspension were plated onto Reasoners 2 Agar (R2A) for growth of bacteria.  Dilutions that provided a good separation of bacterial colonies were subsequently used for isolation of individual bacterial colonies through re-streaking of single bacterial colonies from the dilution plates onto single R2A plates to establish a pure bacterial colony. Around 400 bacterial strains were obtained from sterile seedlings. MALDI spectra were acquired for all novel bacterial and fungal strains to determine the relatedness of each strain.

The Hierarchical Clustering tree was assessed for clades that contained strains (i) common to both G. clandestine and G. max that could be transferred to both species, and (ii) unique to G. clandestine that could be introduced to G. max. A clade was identified containing Sphingomonas sp. strains isolated from both G. clandestine and G. max, which is a bacterial species identified in the core microbiome of G. clandestine and G.  max (Figure 9). Example 8 - Use of MALDI to identify bacterial strains exclusive to a plant phenotype A method has been developed that uses MALDI to compare protein spectra from bacterial strains isolated plant lines exhibiting different phenotypes, to identify closely related bacterial strains that are exclusive to a specific phenotype. A total of 580 bacterial strains were isolated from seeds of 11 wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines that were phenotyped as either drought tolerant or drought resistant.  The protein profiles of all bacterial strains were acquired, processed and analysed to determine their phylogenetic relatedness.     A clade was identified that contained closely related Arthrobacter bacterial strains that were exclusive to the drought tolerant lines (Figure 10). These bacterial strains all had spectra with identical proteins, differing only in the intensity of those proteins.  This clade represents closely related bacterial strains that are exclusive to a plant phenotype.
