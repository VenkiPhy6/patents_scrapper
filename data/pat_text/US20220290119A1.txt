    [0001]
     The present invention relates to novel yeast strains of  Phaffia rhodozyma  which produce high amounts of carotenoids, in particular high amounts of astaxanthin. These novel strains are capable of producing increasing amounts of carotenoids in the presence of increasing concentrations of carbon source. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   
    
    [0002]
     Astaxanthin (3,3′-dihydroxy-β, β′-carotene-4,4′-dione) is a naturally-occurring lipid-soluble red oxycarotenoid pigment that is found in certain marine plants, crustaceans, fish and yeast. In commercial aquaculture, astaxanthin is often added to the diet of salmonids and crustaceans to impart in their flesh the distinctive pink colouration found in indigenous species. Imparting this distinctive pink colouration is believed to be important in encouraging consumer acceptance of salmonids and crustaceans produced through aquaculture. 
     
    
    [0003]
     The planar structure of astaxanthin is shown below: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0004]
     Astaxanthin is characterized by the presence of oxygen molecules in its structure. The astaxanthin molecule has two asymmetric carbons located at the 3, 3′ positions of the β-ionone ring with a hydroxyl group (—OH) on either end of the molecule. Astaxanthin is composed of hydroxyl and keto moieties on both ends. Its lipophilic and hydrophilic properties allow it to align in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane (Yang 2013, J Hum Nutr Food Sci 1:1003, Ambati 2014, Mar Drugs. 2014 January; 12(1)). The red pigment colour is due to the conjugated double bonds at the centre of the compound. This type of conjugated double bond acts as a strong antioxidant by donating electrons and reacting with free radicals to convert them into more stable products and terminating free radical chain reactions in a wide variety of living organisms. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Astaxanthin has been widely studied and it has been demonstrated that it has numerous clinical health benefits such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, being anti-diabetic, in sports nutrition (mitigating effects on endurance, sports performance and heat stress), prevention of CVD, and promotion of healthy brain, eyes and skin (Yang 2013, J Hum Nutr Food Sci 1:1003; Ambati 2014, Mar Drugs. 2014 January; 12(1)). Astaxanthin's antioxidant activity has been demonstrated in several studies and it has been reported that it has up to several-fold stronger free radical antioxidant activity than vitamin E and β-carotene (Kurashge et.al., 1990, Shimidzu et.al., 1996). The antioxidant properties of astaxanthin are believed to have a key role in several other properties such as protection against UV-light photooxidation, cancer,  Helicobacter pylori  infection, aging and age-related diseases, and in promotion of the immune response, and liver, heart, joint and prostate health (Guerin, Huntley and Olaizola, 2003). 
     
    
    [0006]
     Sources of astaxanthin are in great demand by the aquaculture industry, particularly as astaxanthin is an expensive feed ingredient, and for human consumption. The natural sources of astaxanthin for industrial use are microalgae ( Haematococcus pluvialis ), the yeast  Phaffia rhodozyma  and marine bacteria  Paracoccus carotinifaciens . The aquaculture industry continues to expand and the production of Atlantic salmon also has increased in recent years. Since farmed salmon, trout and crustacea are not fed stable diets of natural astaxanthin sources such as shrimp and krill, their astaxanthin consumption must be derived from the feed consumed. Without the addition of astaxanthin to their diet, farm grown salmon are white instead of orange-pink in colour. Synthetic astaxanthin is the main carotenoid used worldwide in the aquaculture industry. Synthetic astaxanthin consists of a mixture 1:2:1 of isomers (3S, 3S), (3R, 3S), and (3R, 3R), respectively. However, the growing consumers' demand for natural foods without the use of synthetic dyes is the underlying driver for major efforts to improve astaxanthin production from biological sources instead of synthetic ones,  Phaffia  yeast has been proven to be a reliable source of astaxanthin, but current solutions are extremely costly. 
     
    
    [0007]
     The yeast  Phaffia rhodozyma  was first isolated from slime fluxes of birch trees in colder regions, such as in Russia, Chile, Finland, Japan and the United States, in the late 1960s by Herman J. Phaff. This yeast reproduced vegetatively by budding and later a sexual state of  Phaffia rhodozyma  was defined and was named  Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous  (XDEN). The yeast  Phaffia rhodozyma  is of basidiomycetous origin. Criteria used in identifying  Phaffia rhodozyma  as basidiomycetous include its ability to synthesize carotenoids, of which astaxanthin is the principal component; its multi-layered cell wall structure and mode of bud formation and its ability to ferment several sugars; a property not shared by any other carotenoid-producing yeast. 
     
    
    [0008]
     The wild-type strain of  Phaffia rhodozyma  produces low levels of astaxanthin typically 100 to 300 parts per million (ppm) of the yeast dry mass and hence they are not a practical or economical source (Torrissen, Hardy and Shearer, 1989). Mutant strains of  Phaffia rhodozyma  have been described as being capable of producing high levels of astaxanthin under certain growth conditions such as low glucose levels in the growth media; see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,356,809, 5,922,560, Barredo 2012, An et al 1989, Jeong-Hwan 2004, and Baeza 2010. Astaxanthin over-producing  Phaffia rhodozyma  strains with over 5000 μg astaxanthin per g yeast dry mass can be obtained through mutagenesis of the wild-type strain. However, due to the increasing needs for astaxanthin in the food, nutrition and health industries, there exists a need for further strains of  Phaffia rhodozyma  which produce even higher levels of astaxanthin under a range of growth conditions, in particular in the presence of changing amounts or higher amounts of carbon source, and also when the yeast is cultivated at high biomass concentrations. The novel  Phaffia rhodozyma  strains of the invention fulfil these needs, and produce very high levels of astaxanthin and are amenable to industrial-scale fermentation. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   
    
    [0009]
     The invention provides astaxanthin over-producing strains which produce exceptionally high levels of carotenoids, such as astaxanthin. Remarkably, these strains are able to produce increased amounts of carotenoids in the presence of 1-10% carbon source, making them particularly amenable to industrial-scale fermentation in which fluctuations in carbon source concentrations will typically occur. Such strains can therefore provide increased efficiency and increased yield of carotenoid production, in particular of astaxanthin production. The strains of the invention therefore have application for the industrial production of carotenoids, in particular astaxanthin, both for the aquaculture industry and for human consumption. 
     
    
    [0010]
     Accordingly, the invention provides yeast strains of  Phaffia rhodozyma , wherein the yeast strains are inter alia characterized in that they are capable of producing a greater amount of carotenoid when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source.

     The invention provides a yeast strain of  Phaffia rhodozyma , wherein the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing a greater amount of carotenoid when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source.

    [0028]
     Preferably, the yeast strain of the invention is capable of producing a greater amount of carotenoid when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising from about 3% (w/v) to about 8% (w/v), or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v), or about 3.5% (w/v), about 4% (w/v), about 4.5% (w/v) or about 5% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source.

     The yeast strain of the invention may comprise a genome comprising at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least six of i) to vi) defined in the following:
           i) a point mutation at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715 (e.g., the point mutation referred to in SEQ ID NO:5 according to Table 20);   ii) a point mutation at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955 (e.g., the point mutation referred to in SEQ ID NO:4 according to Table 20);   iii) two-point mutations at positions 318703 and 318738 in scaffold 242, upstream to gene XDEN_00738 (e.g., the point mutations referred to in SEQ ID NO:1 according to Table 20);   iv) two-point mutations at positions 855 and 1020 in scaffold 88, downstream to gene XDEN_06229 (e.g., the point mutations referred to in SEQ ID NO:2 according to Table 20);   v) a deletion of two bases immediately following position 213879 in scaffold 162, located at the gene XDEN_00195 (e.g., the mutation referred to in SEQ ID NO:3 according to Table 20); and vi) two-point mutations at positions 84078 and 84206 in scaffold 24, at the gene XDEN_01573 (e.g., the point mutations referred to in SEQ ID NO:6 according to Table 20).       
   
    
    [0035]
     In some embodiments, the genome comprises all of the mutations as defined in i) to vi). 
     
    
    [0036]
     The point mutation(s) may be present in at least one, at least two, or in all alleles of said genes. Preferably, the point mutation(s) is (are) present in all alleles of said gene(s). 
     
    
    [0037]
     In a preferred embodiment, the yeast strain of the invention may comprise a genome comprising a point mutation at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955 named crtE. Preferably, the point mutation at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 is a G to A (guanine to adenine) change, resulting in an amino acid exchange of proline to serine in the protein encoded by crtE (at gene XDEN_05955 which is encoded on the complementary reverse strand (codon CCG→TCG base substitution)). 
     
    
    [0038]
     In some embodiments, a point mutation in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955 named crtE results in an alteration of crtE function. Function of crtE (also known as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase) can for example be measured by quantification of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) amounts in extracts of  Phaffia rhodozyma.    
     
    
    [0039]
     In a preferred embodiment, the yeast strain of the invention may comprise a genome comprising a point mutation at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715 named erg20. Preferably, the point mutation at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715 (named erg20), is a G to A (guanine to adenine) change. 
     
    
    [0040]
     In some embodiments, a point mutation in scaffold 69 at gene XDEN_04715 named erg20 results in an alteration of erg20 function. Function of erg20 (also known as farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase) can for example be measured by overexpressing the mutated gene in cell culture (e.g., in yeast or in  E. coli ), isolating protein extracts from transformed cells and performing farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase activity assays in vitro with said protein extracts. Overexpression of wild-type erg20 can be used as a positive control, and non-transformed or non-induced cultures can be used as a negative control. 
     
    
    [0041]
     In preferred embodiments, the yeast strain of the invention comprises a genome comprising a point mutation at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955 named crtE, and in addition a point mutation at position 2028187 in scaffold 69 in the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715 named erg20. 
     
    
    [0042]
     The erg20 and crtE are genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. The ERG20 protein (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase) is responsible for the condensation of DMAPP and IPP to form geranyl-diphosphate (geranyl-PP). Furthermore, ERG20 also catalyzes the addition of a second IPP molecule to the geranyl-PP, producing farnesyl-diphosphate (FPP). FPP is then converted to geranylgeranyl-diphosphate (GGPP) by the GGDP synthase (the crtE encoded protein). This GGPP intermediate is then condensed to phytoene by phytoene synthase (CrtB). DMAPP, IPP, FPP, GGPP are all precursors of beta-carotene. However, the present invention has for the first time determined that specific mutations in erg20 and crtE genes enable  Phaffia rhodozyma  yeast to produce a greater amount of carotenoid when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising higher (e.g., at least 3% (w/v)) concentrations of carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising lower (e.g., 1% (w/v)) concentrations of carbon source.

    [0044]
     The yeast strain of the invention may comprise a genome comprising two-point mutations at positions 855 and 1020 in scaffold 88, downstream to gene XDEN_06229. 
     
    
    [0045]
     The yeast strain of the invention may comprise a genome comprising a deletion of two bases immediately following position 213879 in scaffold 162, at the gene XDEN_00195. 
     
    
    [0046]
     The yeast strain of the invention may comprise a genome comprising two-point mutations at positions 84078 and 84206 in scaffold 24, at the gene XDEN_01573. Whereas the mutation in position 84078 is defined as an intronic mutation, the mutation in position 84206 is an exonic mutation which leads to a histidine to tyrosine amino acid 600 substitution (codon CAT→TAT base substitution) in gene XDEN_01573 which is encoded on the complementary reverse strand. 
     
    
    [0047]
     The invention also provides a yeast strain of  Phaffia rhodozyma , wherein the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing a greater amount of carotenoid when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source, wherein the yeast strain of the invention comprises a genome comprising:
           i) a point mutation at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715 (named erg20), and/or   ii) a point mutation at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955 (named crtE).

Preferably, the point mutation at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 is a G to A (guanine to adenine) change, resulting in an amino acid exchange of proline to serine in the protein encoded by crtE (at gene XDEN_05955 which is encoded on the complementary reverse strand (codon CCG→TCG base substitution)). 
     
    
    [0051]
     The point mutation at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715, can be for example a point mutation referred to in SEQ ID NO:5 according to Table 20.

    [0090]
     Preferably, the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of carotenoid at least 1.2 times greater when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 3% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source. More preferably, the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of carotenoid at least 1.3 times greater when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 3% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source.

    [0094]

    [0095]
     As the skilled person will appreciate, the comparisons referred to herein, e.g., cultivation in 1% (w/v) carbon source versus cultivation in 3% (w/v) carbon source, are comparisons of carotenoid production under growing conditions that differ solely in the amounts of carbon source over the same time period. 
     
    
    [0096]
     For example, a typical cultivation period for the yeast strain in each case is at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least 8 days, at least 10 days, at least 12 days or at least 13 days, for example 6 days, 6.5 days, 7 days, 7.5 days, 8 days, 8.5 days, 9 days, 9.5 days, 10 days, 10.5 days, 11 days, 11.5 days, 12 days, 12.5 days, 13 days, 13.5 days, 14 days, 14.5 days or 15 days. 
     
    
    [0097]
     The increased production of carotenoids (e.g., astaxanthin) in higher concentrations of carbon source is a remarkable and surprising effect of the strains of the invention because  Phaffia rhodozyma  typically produce maximal amounts of carotenoids at glucose concentrations lower than 2%, which is a typical condition for high scale production of  Phaffia rhodozyma , as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,560. For example, it is a common observation that the synthesis of carotenoids is particularly low at glucose concentrations greater than 15 g/L, i.e., 1.5% (w/v) glucose. Therefore, yeast strains of the invention are capable of producing high amounts of carotenoids despite fluctuations in carbon source concentration which typically occur in fermentation processes, particularly large-scale fermentation processes. It is also remarkable that this effect in higher carbon source concentrations occurs whilst at the same time the yeast strains produce very high amounts of carotenoids, as demonstrated in the Examples. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the strains of the invention achieve these effects independent of pathways which mediate a repression of carotenoid production in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. For example, the high-carotenoid producing “AF” strains described herein are able to grow in sucrose-based media and also to perform ethanol fermentation during anaerobic conditions, indicating that the Snf1-Mig1 glucose sensing pathway in the “AF” strains does not underlie the effect. Furthermore, the “AF” strains described herein retain their high carotenoid (and therefore, astaxanthin) production in multiple different carbon sources, emphasizing that the Snf1-Mig1 glucose sensing pathway is not required for this effect. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the strains of the invention do not rely on a de-repression of carotenoid production in the presence of high concentrations of carbon source (e.g., glucose). 
     
    
    [0098]
     In some embodiments, the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 7500 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days, or for example, 7.5 days, in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source, such as from about 3% (w/v) to about 10% (w/v) carbon source, or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) carbon source. Preferably, the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 12000 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days, or for example, 7.5 days, in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source, such as for example from about 3% (w/v) to about 10% (w/v) carbon source, or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) carbon source. More preferably, the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 18000 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days, or for example, 7.5 days, in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source, such as for example from about 3% (w/v) to about 10% (w/v) carbon source, or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) carbon source. Even more preferably, the yeast strain is characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 35000 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days, or for example, 7.5 days, in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source, such as for example from about 3% (w/v) to about 10% (w/v) carbon source, or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) carbon source. 
     
    
    [0099]
     The yeast strain of the invention can also be characterized in that it is capable of accumulating increased total amounts of carotenoids at 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days or 13 days cultivation than when cultivated for 6 days, e.g., more than 1.2, preferably more than 1.3, more preferably more than 1.4 times greater total carotenoid amount than when cultivated for 6 days. 
     
    
    [0100]
     For example, the yeast strain of the invention can be characterized in that it is capable of accumulating more than 1.4 times greater carotenoids (e.g., astaxanthin) from day 6 to day 13 of cultivation in a yeast growth medium comprising from about 3% (w/v) to about 10% (w/v) carbon source, or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) carbon source. 
     
    
    [0101]
     In accordance with all yeast strains of the invention, the carotenoid produced is preferably at least 50% (w/w) astaxanthin of the total amount of carotenoid produced. 
     
    
    [0102]
     Process for Large-Scale Fermentation of  Phaffia  Strains of the Invention 
     
    
    [0103]
     The invention also provides a process for producing carotenoid by large-scale fermentation of a yeast strain of the invention. Generally, the process involves cultivating the yeast strain in a suitable volume of yeast growth medium, before cultivating in a fermenter, and at the end of fermentation harvesting the cell mass and extracting the carotenoid (e.g., astaxanthin). In a large-scale fermentation process, the carbon source concentration is preferably kept low, e.g., to below 5 g/L throughout the fermentation. 
     
    
    [0104]
     In a typical large-scale fermentation process, a loop of yeast strain can be taken from a petri dish and inoculated into a flask (e.g., of 250 ml) containing medium (e.g., 20 ml) supplemented with a suitable amount of yeast extract (e.g. 15 g/L) and carbon source (e.g., 10 g/L). The flask is incubated with agitating at a suitable temperature for a period of time for the yeast to multiply, e.g. 20° C. for 24 hr. Subsequently, a portion of this yeast suspension is inoculated into a larger flask (e.g., a 5 L Erlenmeyer flask) containing yeast growth medium (e.g., 500 ml). The larger flask is then incubated with agitating at a suitable temperature for a period of time for the yeast to multiply, e.g. 20° C. for 48 to 72 hr. Subsequently, the yeast suspension is seeded into a fermenter (e.g., 7 L or 70 L) containing yeast growth medium. Suitable fermentation start conditions are, for example: 1 v/v aeration, 300 rpm agitation, % dissolved oxygen (DO 2 ) 40, 20° C. and pH 5 to 6. Due to the Crabtree effect, in the processes of the prior art, the carbon source (e.g. glucose) solutions are typically applied with fed-batch fermentation as it is necessary to keep the carbon source concentration below 5 g/L (0.5% (w/v)), preferably below 2 g/L (0.2% (w/v)), throughout the fermentation. The pH can be controlled, for example, using ammonia. Dissolved oxygen can be controlled by agitation and airflow to between 40% and 75% saturation. Antifoam can be added as needed. Example 11 provides further details on suitable fermentation processes. After the fermentation broth containing the  Phaffia rhodozyma  cells has reached a desired cell density or carotenoid/astaxanthin content, the cell mass may be harvested. 
     
    
    [0105]
     Examples of suitable small-batch fermentation and fed-batch fermentation processes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,560, which is incorporated by reference. Other examples of suitable fermentation processes are described, e.g., in Yeast Strain Selection edited by Chandra J. Panchal, 1990, page 140, which is incorporated by reference, or in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,232,045, 3,617,306A, EP 0 237 427 B2, the entire disclosures of which are also incorporated by reference. 
     
    
    [0106]
     All of these fed-batch processes bear the disadvantage that the amount of the carbon source is difficult to keep at a constant level and it may increase considerably in the fermentation suspension for a short time during the feeding steps, i.e., to higher than about 2% (w/v), which leads to a strong Crabtree effect which is responsible for the production of large amounts of unwanted fermentation by-products such as ethanol and acetate, resulting in low biomass, and greatly reduced carotenoid and astaxanthin synthesis. Since the  Phaffia  strains of the invention are significantly more tolerable against higher amounts of carbon sources in the fermentation media, these strains are particularly suited for the large-scale production of astaxanthin. Also, the carbon source applied can be used more efficiently during the production of carotenoids, in particular astaxanthin, when using the  Phaffia  strains of the invention. 
     
    
    [0107]
     Uses of the Strains of the Invention 
     
    
    [0108]
     Astaxanthin is widely used as a dietary supplement, such as a nutritional supplement, a food supplement, a beverage supplement, and for food additives such as food colorants. Astaxanthin can also be used as feed supplement for egg-producing chickens and for pig feed. Due to its strong antioxidant activity, astaxanthin also has multiple benefits for human health; for example in Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and skin health; in promoting rehabilitation after heart attack; and in improving the function of the immune system. Thus, the invention also provides a use of the strains of the invention to produce a dietary or a food supplement comprising astaxanthin. 
     
    
    [0109]
     Astaxanthin is also used in the cosmetology industry. Astaxanthin can be placed directly on the skin and it minimizes UV damage, the effects of air pollution and other external influences, and it can slow the aging process. Thus, the invention also provides a use of the strains of the invention to produce a cosmetic composition comprising astaxanthin. 
     
    
    [0110]
     Astaxanthin is also used in aquaculture to provide farm-grown fish, such as salmon, trout, crabs, and shrimp, the flesh reddish colour of wild-grown fish. It is generally incorporated into the diet (e.g., aquaculture feed) of farm-grown fish such as salmonids and trout. Thus, the invention also provides a use of the strains of the invention to produce a dye comprising astaxanthin. The dye is suitable for colouring flesh, preferably fish flesh. 
     
    
    [0111]
     In one embodiment, the invention provides a use of the strains of the invention to produce a product comprising astaxanthin. The product may be a dietary supplement, a nutritional supplement, a food supplement, a beverage supplement, a food additive or a feed additive such as a feed colorant; a pharmaceutical composition for human health, for example for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular diseases, in promoting rehabilitation after heart attack, or for improving the function of the immune system; or a cosmetic composition.

    [0148]
     Culture collections all over the world (for example ATCC, NCYC and CBS) hold deposits of different wild-type  Phaffia rhodozyma  strains. Mutagenesis is a process that results in genetic changes in yeast cells, and it is applied to increase the genetic variation within the yeast population by increasing mutation frequency during DNA replication. Mutagenesis can be induced by physical agents like ultraviolet (UV) radiation (non-chemical mutagenesis) or by chemical molecules such as ethylmethane sulphonate (EMS) or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) and diethyl sulfate (chemical mutagenesis). Mutagenesis is typically random. To obtain over-producing astaxanthin strains, non-chemical mutagenesis and chemical mutagenesis can be used alone or in combination. 
     
    
    [0149]
     According to a typical mutagenesis protocol (for example in EP0438182A1), a chemical mutagen is added to a cell suspension in buffer, and vials are incubated at room temperature with or without shaking for a duration of time such as between 15 minutes to 2 hours. After exposure to the mutagen, cells are collected, diluted and seeded onto agar medium plates. The composition of plates usually contains a carbon source (such as glucose, raffinose, or others), yeast extract, peptone and agar. The cells are distributed over the plate surface by glass beads or a cell spreader (Drigalskispatel). Seeded plates are inverted and incubated for example at around 20° C. for up to 10 days. Similar cultivation procedures can be used for non-chemical mutagenesis.

     After each mutagenesis cycle, yeast mutants are screened for the desired property. For example, after each cycle of mutagenesis, yeast cells can be incubated until the appearance of improved pigmentation that can be easily recognized by visual screening. In order to identify strains which overproduce the pigment astaxanthin, selective medium and/or screening agents that strengthen colour differences between colonies can be used. 
     
    
    [0151]
     Plates are visually screened and high pigmentation colonies are picked for an isolation seeding. These isolates are further transferred to flasks (e.g., 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask) with growth medium (routinely containing a carbon source, peptone, and yeast extract) for a period of incubation (e.g. 6-7 days at around 20° C.), followed by total carotenoid and astaxanthin analysis. An example of mutagenesis and screening of  Phaffia rhodozyma  is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,560.

     Importantly, the strain has not been modified by recombinant DNA technology. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the strains of the invention have not been modified by recombinant DNA technology. 
     
    
    [0153]
     Isolated strains with highest total carotenoids and astaxanthin levels are used for repeated mutagenesis to obtain strains which show very high astaxanthin concentrations, and which produce a greater amount of carotenoid when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source, such as from about 3% (w/v) to about 10% (w/v), or from about 3% (w/v) to about 8% (w/v), or from about 3% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v), or about 3.5% (w/v), about 4% (w/v), about 4.5% (w/v) or about 5% (w/v), or about 6% (w/v), or about 7% (w/v), or about 8% (w/v), compared to the amount of carotenoid produced when cultivated in a yeast growth medium comprising 1% (w/v) carbon source. In some embodiments, the ratio of carotenoid produced when cultivated in 3% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in 1% (w/v) carbon source is at least 1.1, preferably it is at least 1.2, and more preferably it is at least 1.3. In some embodiments, the ratio of carotenoid produced when cultivated in 5% (w/v) carbon source compared to when cultivated in 1% (w/v) carbon source is at least 1.1, preferably it is at least 1.2, and more preferably it is at least 1.3. 
     
    
    [0154]
     In some embodiments, the yeast strain obtained by the method is further characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 7500 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source. 
     
    
    [0155]
     Preferably, the yeast strain obtained by the method is further characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 12000 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source. 
     
    
    [0156]
     More preferably, the yeast strain obtained by the method is further characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 18000 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source. 
     
    
    [0157]
     Even more preferably, the yeast strain obtained by the method is further characterized in that it is capable of producing an amount of at least 35000 μg carotenoid per g of yeast dry weight when cultivated for at least 7.5 days in a yeast growth medium comprising at least 3% (w/v) carbon source. 
     
    
    [0158]
     In some embodiments, the yeast strain obtained by the method is characterized in that it is capable of accumulating increased total amounts of carotenoids at 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days or 13 days cultivation than when cultivated for 6 days, e.g., more than 1.2, preferably more than 1.3, more preferably more than 1.4 times greater total carotenoid amount than when cultivated for 6 days. 
     
    
    [0159]
     Accordingly, the invention provides a carotenoid over-producing yeast strain obtained by a method provided herein. 
     
    
    [0160]
     Carotenoid Extraction and Analysis 
     
    
    [0161]
     The invention also provides astaxanthin produced by a strain of the invention. In some embodiments, the astaxanthin produced by a strain of the invention is provided in the form of a composition. 
     
    
    [0162]
     Total carotenoid analysis is widely used in the investigation of  Phaffia rhodozyma  over-producing strains and is described in the literature, for example in Sedmak et.al, 1990. An example of such a protocol is as follows. Cells are collected and washed, e.g. with de-ionized water. Optionally, cell walls can be disrupted by the enzymatic technique for example as previously described in M. Michelon et al., 2012. In brief, pelleted cells are incubated with a lysing enzyme from  Trichoderma harzianum  in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer pH=5.04 for 30 min at 55° C. with agitating, followed by centrifugation and the pellet is washed twice with distilled water. Washed cells are dried, re-suspended in DMSO (pre-heated to around 55° C.). The tubes are vortexed vigorously and phosphate buffer and organic solvent are subsequently added. The phases are separated by centrifugation and the organic phase is removed. Samples of the organic phase can be further diluted with DMSO and the OD measured by spectrophotometer at 470-495 nm. The total carotenoid content is determined from the absorbency at 470-495 nm. 
     
    
    [0163]
     The carotenoid content can be calculated using the following equation. 
         TC =( A/E )×10 4 ×dilution factor
           A is Value of absorbency   E is Extinction coefficient   (The extinction coefficient E=2150 was determined by using synthetic astaxanthin.)       
   
    
    [0167]
     For astaxanthin extraction and analysis, yeast cells are collected and washed with de-ionized water or sodium acetate buffer (0.2 M, pH=5.04) and pelleted by centrifugation. Optionally, cell walls can be disrupted by the enzymatic technique for example as previously described in M. Michelon et al., 2012. In brief, pelleted cells are incubated with a lysing enzyme from  Trichoderma harzianum  in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer pH=5.04 for 30 min at 55° C. with agitating. After that, cells are centrifugated and the pellet is washed twice with distilled water. Washed cells are transferred into vessels, pelleted and residual water is removed. Cell pellets are ruptured, e.g., with acetone and glass beads, followed by centrifugation to pellet cell debris and glass beads. 
     
    
    [0168]
     Astaxanthin levels in the obtained solution can be quantified by normal-phase HPLC with a silica column and hexane:acetone (e.g., 86:14) mobile phase. To calculate astaxanthin concentration, a standard curve of synthetic astaxanthin can be used.

    [0171]
     A full inoculation loop of fresh yeast was transferred from a YM agar plate to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml YM media with 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated in a shaker incubator at 2000 with agitating for 48 hours, for each mutant strain. The cell suspensions were aseptically collected and concentrated approximately 2-fold and a volume of 800 μl of concentrated cell suspension was transferred into 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 ml of a medium (peptone 0.5%, yeast extract 0.3%, carbon source 3%, and malt extract 0.3%) and incubated at 20° C. for 7.5 days with agitating.

    [0175]
     A full inoculation loop of fresh yeast was transferred from a YM agar plate to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml YM media with 1% glucose and incubated in a shaker incubator at 20° C. with agitating for 24 hours. The cell suspension was aseptically collected and concentrated approximately 3-fold (from 20 ml to 6 ml). A volume of 300-400 μl of concentrated cell suspension was transferred into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml fresh YM media with either 1% (w/v) or 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 20° C. with agitating. Six days later, yeast cells were collected and total carotenoid (TC) content was measured.

     Table 6.1 demonstrates that the “AF” strains according to the invention produce higher levels of carotenoids while growing in YM media with higher (3% (w/v) vs 1% (w/v)) glucose concentration, unlike the reference strains, NCYC 4245 and ATCC 74220. Unlike the “AF” strains, the reference strains NCYC 4245 and ATCC 74220 contain a G at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715, and they contain a G at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955. The ratio of carotenoid production in YM media with 3% (w/v) glucose compared to in YM media with 1% (w/v) glucose is 0.63 and 0.80 for the reference strains ATCC 74220 and NCYC 4245 respectively, i.e. much less carotenoid is produced in the higher glucose concentration. In contrast, the ratio for the strains according to the invention is at least 1.1 (see e.g. AF-04), and for some strains at least 1.3 (see e.g. AF-02, AF-03, AF-05 and AF-07) and for some strains at least 1.8 (see e.g. AF-06, AF-08, AF-09, AF-10 and AF-11). In the above table 6.1, AF-09 and AF-11 showed the highest ratio of 2.57 and 2.16, respectively. In addition to the high ratios, the total carotenoid content is very high for the AF-03 to AF-11 strains after cultivation in YM 3% (w/v) glucose. These characteristics of the strains of the invention are exceptional for carotenoid production in  Phaffia rhodozyma , which are typically cultivated in low to very low glucose concentrations (for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,560). 
     
    
    [0177]
     The same experiment as described above was performed, except that astaxanthin content was measured. The ratio between astaxanthin production in YM 3% (w/v) vs in YM 1% (w/v) glucose is presented in Table 6.2.

The reference strain NCYC 4245 contains a G at position 2028187 in scaffold 69, at the upstream region of gene XDEN_04715, and they contain a G at position 1540450 in scaffold 79 at gene XDEN_05955. The ratio for the strains according to the invention is at least 1.7 (see e.g. AF-05 and AF-10), and for some strains at least 2.1 (see e.g. AF-11) and for some strains at least 2.4 (see e.g. AF-07 and AF-09). These characteristics of the strains of the invention are exceptional for astaxanthin production in  Phaffia rhodozyma.    
     
    
    [0179]
     Similar experiments were then performed in YE medium (containing yeast extract 4 g/L and glucose) instead of YM medium. 
     
    
    [0180]
     A full inoculation loop of fresh yeast was transferred from a YM agar plate to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml YM media with 1% glucose and incubated in a shaker incubator at 20° C. with agitating for 24 hours. The cell suspension was aseptically collected and concentrated approximately 3-fold (from 20 ml to 6 ml). A volume of 300-400 μl of concentrated cell suspension was transferred into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml fresh YE media (media containing yeast extract 4 g/L and glucose) with either 1% (w/v) or 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 20° C. with agitating. Six days later, yeast cells were collected and total carotenoid (TC) or astaxanthin content was measured. The ratio between TC production in YE 3% (w/v) vs in YE 1% (w/v) glucose is presented in Table 6.3 and the ratio between astaxanthin production in YE 3% (w/v) vs in YE 1% (w/v) glucose is presented in Table 6.4.

     Tables 6.3 and 6.4 demonstrate that the same effect is obtained using YE medium. The “AF” strains according to the invention produce higher levels of TC and higher levels of astaxanthin while growing in YE media with higher (3% (w/v) vs 1% (w/v)) glucose concentration, unlike the reference strain, NCYC 4245. The ratio for the strains according to the invention is at least 1.6 and for some strains at least 2.2, demonstrating that the characteristics of the strains of the invention are exceptional for astaxanthin production in  Phaffia rhodozyma.

A volume of 300-400 μl of concentrated cell suspension was transferred into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml fresh YM media with 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 2000 with agitating. After 6-13 days, yeast cells were collected and total carotenoid (TC) content was measured. Results are provided in Table 13 as the ratio to total carotenoid production at day 6.

   Example 11: Laboratory-Scale Fermentation (7 Litres) 
   
    
    [0202]
     A loop from frozen culture was transferred onto a petri dish of YM and incubated in 20° C. for 72 hr. A loop from the petri dish was inoculated into a 250 ml flask containing 20 ml medium supplemented with 15 g/L yeast extract and 10 g/L glucose. The flask was incubated at 20° C. for 24 hr with agitating. Then, 2-7 ml of yeast suspension were inoculated into a 5 L Erlenmeyer flask containing 500 ml of media supplemented with 15 g/L yeast extract and 10 g/L glucose. The Erlenmeyer flask was put into a 20° C. incubator with agitation. 48-72 hr later, the yeast suspension was seeded into a 7 L fermenter. 
     
    
    [0203]
     Fermentation start conditions were as follows: 1 vv aeration, 300 rpm agitation, DO 2  40, 20° C. and pH 5-6. Glucose solutions were applied with fed-batch fermentation to keep the glucose concentration below 2 g/L, and the pH was controlled using ammonia. Antifoam was added as needed. The medium composition, minerals mix and vitamins mix are provided below.

     Pilot-Scale Fermentation (70 Litres) 
     
    
    [0206]
     About 3-4 litres of growth media from the laboratory scale fermenter with 60-80 g growing culture were inoculated into a 70 litre fermenter in a pilot-scale fermentation. 
     
    
    [0207]
     Fermentation start conditions were 1 vv aeration, 300 rpm agitation, DO2 40, 20° C. and pH 5-6. The culture was fed glucose as a 60% by weight solution at a rate such that the glucose concentration is less than 5 grams per liter (g/L), preferably less than 2 g/L throughout the fermentation. The glucose concentration at the start of the fermentation was 1.15 g/L. Dissolved oxygen was controlled by agitation and airflow to between 40% and 75% saturation.

     Table 18 shows that the AF-06, AF-07, AF-09 and AF-11 strains produced a high level of total carotenoids and astaxanthin during cultivation in a 7-litre fermenter and Table 19 demonstrates that the AF-03 strain produces a very high level of astaxanthin despite being cultivated in a 70 litre fermenter. 
   Example 12: The AF-02, AF-03, AF-04, AF-05, AF-06, AF-07, AF-08, AF-09, AF-10 and AF-11 Strains According to the Invention were Further Characterized by Sanger Sequencing Analysis 
   
    
    [0211]
     The DNA sequences were obtained by using PCR followed by Sanger sequencing using Big-Dye terminator sequencing on a 3730xl capillary electrophoresis device (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific). The PCR used primers designed for amplification of specific genomic DNA fragments as disclosed below. PCR was carried out after preparation of DNA from yeast using standard protocols (DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix (2×), ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), with 1.4 ng DNA under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95° C. for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95° C. denaturation for 30 seconds, 55° C. or 60° C. annealing for 45 seconds, and 72° C. elongation for 1 minute. 
     
    
    [0212]
     Table 20 presents the scaffolds, unique sets of primers used and the six amplified genomic DNA fragments present in AF-02, AF-03, AF-04, AF-05, AF-06, AF-07, AF-08, AF-09, AF-10 and AF-11 strains. All of said strains contain the sequences as set forth in Table 20—see also the accompanying sequence listing. Mutations and point mutations of the strains of the invention are indicated in bold with underlining.

   Example 13: Genomic Markers of the Generated Yeast Strains were Analyzed 
   
    
    [0213]
     Genomic DNA was prepared for sequencing using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After processing, libraries were assessed for size using an Agilent TapeStation 2000 automated electrophoresis device (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif., and for concentration by a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Mass. DNA libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer, with paired-end 2×150 base reads. Bioinformatics analysis was done providing at least 1000 bp long contigs using coverage of at least 250×. Copy number variations were assessed individually for each genome based on coverage, looking for large-scale fluctuations from the genome-wide median. 
     
    
    [0214]
     Strains according to the invention were found to be characterized by point mutations, as described below, in all alleles. In contrast, in the yeast strain CBS6938 used in the systematic sequencing project located at the ENA database [accession ids LN483084-LN483350, (Sharma et al 2015)], there are no such point mutations in said genes. All mutations or modifications referred to herein relate to comparison with the  Phaffia rhodozyma  wild type strain.
           Gene XDEN_05955 named crtE located at scaffold 79—comprises a point mutation at position 1540450 (G to A change) leading to amino acid exchange (exchange of Proline to Serine).   Gene XDEN_04715 named erg20 located at scaffold 69—comprises a point mutation at position 2028187 in the upstream region.       
 Example 14: Percentage of Astaxanthin Out of Total Carotenoid Content 
   
    
    [0217]
     A full inoculation loop of fresh yeast was transferred from a YM agar plate to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml YM media with 1% glucose and incubated in a shaker incubator at 20° C. with agitating for 24 hours. The cell suspension was aseptically collected and concentrated approximately 3-fold (from 20 ml to 6 ml). A volume of 300 to 400 μl of concentrated cell suspension was transferred into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml fresh YM media with 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 20° C. with agitating. Seven days later, yeast cells were collected, total carotenoid (TC) content and astaxanthin amount were measured. The percentage of astaxanthin out of TC content (w/w) was calculated according to the formula: 
       % Astaxanthin=Astaxanthin amount/ TC  content*100 
     
    
    [0218]
     The results are summarized in Table 21.

    [0220]
     A full inoculation loop of fresh yeast was transferred from a YM agar plate to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml YM media with 1% glucose and incubated in a shaker incubator at 20° C. with agitating for 24 hours. The cell suspension was aseptically collected and concentrated approximately 3-fold (from 20 ml to 6 ml). A volume of 300-400 μl of concentrated cell suspension was transferred into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml fresh YE media (containing yeast extract 4 g/L and glucose) with either 1% (w/v) or 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 20° C. with agitating. Six days later, yeast cells were collected and the yield of astaxanthin production (mg) per gram glucose (Y P/S ) was measured. The ratio between Y P/S  in YE 3% (w/v) vs in YE 1% (w/v) glucose is presented in Table 22.

     As illustrated above, the improved strains of the invention, when grown in media comprising 3% glucose concentration compared to media comprising 1% glucose concentration, have an increased Y P/S  (astaxanthin production (mg) per g glucose), unlike the wild-type and reference strains, which have a decreased Y P/S . The increased ratio of astaxanthin production (Y P/S ) in YE media with 3% (w/v) glucose compared to in YE media with 1% (w/v) glucose for the strains according to the invention is at least 1.2 (see e.g. AF-03), and for some strains at least 1.3 (see e.g. AF-02, AF-04 and AF-06), and for some strains at least 1.8 (see e.g. AF-05, AF-07, AF-08, AF-09, AF-10 and AF-11).

     As illustrated above, the improved strains of the invention, when grown in media comprising 3% fructose concentration compared to media comprising 1% fructose concentration have an increased Y P/S  (astaxanthin production (mg) per g fructose) of at least 1.2, unlike the wild-type and reference strains, which have a decreased Y P/S  of 0.7 and less. 
   Example 17: Measurement of Ethanol Concentration Produced by Novel AF  Phaffia rhodozyma  Mutants Under Anaerobic Fermentation Conditions 
   
    
    [0224]
     A full inoculation loop of fresh yeast was transferred from a YM agar plate to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 ml YM media with 1% (w/v) glucose and incubated in a shaker incubator at 20° C. with agitating for 24 hours, for each mutant strain. The cell suspensions were aseptically collected and a volume of 18 ml cell suspension was transferred into 5000 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 220 ml of YM media with 3% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 20° C. for 2 days with agitating. After the cells has been incubated in the YM medium, they were submitted to a fermentation step. 10 ml of the cell suspensions were aseptically collected and centrifuged and after discarding the supernatant, cell pellets were resuspended in a volume of 10 ml of YM media with 2% (w/v) sucrose. A volume of 5 ml of cell suspension was then transferred to anaerobic fermentation in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask sealed by silicon stopper with valve and containing 50 ml of YM media with 2% (w/v) sucrose. After 2 days the fermentation was stopped, and the yeast cells were dissociated from the liquid portion of the fermented medium using centrifugation. Ethanol concentrations in the fermented medium samples (g/i) were determined using HPLC, and cell propagation was determined by comparing the biomass (g/l d.m.) at the end of fermentation to the cell biomass at start of fermentation (g/l d.m.).
