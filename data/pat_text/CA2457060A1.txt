This pathogen is endemic to Korea. This novel biopesticide has more effective properties, such as improved resistance to plant disease, promotion of plant growth, and insect repellency as compared to those of HrpN, a hypersensitive response inducing protein, isolated from Erwinia anZylovora (ATCC15580T), which does not exist in Korea. Thus, it can be utilized as a biopesticide effective to prevent plant diseases caused by pathogens and insects and to enhance plant growth as well as a fertilizer.      BACKGOUND ART    The food shortage has been emerged as one of the most serious problems that the people are suffering around the world at present. However, the yields of crop production have been greatly decreasing due to the outbreak of harmful pests, such as pathogens and insects. Currently, chemical pesticides have been mostly used to prevent or control the spread of harmful pests. But their excessive and continued applications become responsible for inducing resistance to those chemical pesticides in pests, although rapid pesticidal effects can be demonstrated by killing the pests directly by using an easier spraying method. In addition, most effective pesticides, which are strongly toxic, have caused social problems due to serious soil and water pollution. Therefore, it is very urgent for the development of an environmently-friendly biopesticides which do not induce any resistance to pests while having effective pesticidal activities.      The general purpose of using a biopesticide is to control pests through a direct application of antagonistic microorganism itself to plants but this is not considered very effective in controlling of the pests. Therefore, recent researches have been progressing to control harmful pests by stimulating the self-defensive system of plants using products of antagonistic microorganisms instead of using microorganisms themselves. In other words, an essential aim of biological control is to decrease or prevent of pests by activating the self-immunological function of a plant via treatment of microorganism-derived materials to plants. The plant disease resistance is primarily conducted by the defense system of a plant ~ via structural barriers such as cutin in epidermal cells, a wax layer and types of porosity. When plant pathogens infiltrate into plant cells, chemicals, such as saponin or lectin, secreted by the plant can prevent the increase of pathogens population [Agrios, G. N. 1997. Plant Pathology.4th Bd. Academic Press, New York; Dong, X. 1998. SA. JA, ethylene, and disease resistance in plants. Curr. Opin.  Plant. Biol.1:316-323; Feys, B. J. & Parker, J. E. 2000. Interplay of signaling pathways in plant disease resistance. Trends Genet.16:339-455].    More essential plant disease resistance refers to a hypersensitive response (HR), i-s a rapid, localized necrosis for preventing spread of pathogens that is associated with the active defense of plants against many pathogens to stimulate their self-defensive system using some microorganism-derived materials.  [Richberg, M. H., Aviv, D. H. & Dangl, J. L. 1998. Dead cells do tell tales. Curr. Poin.  PlantBiol. 1:480-485]. The first method for plant disease resistance associated with HR  induction is that plants mobilize their early alert system to adjacent Bells infected with bacterial pathogens so that these adjacent cells can increase the resistance to pathogens. This defense system is called as 'LAR' (local acquired resistance).      The second method is that through the activation of defense system in non-infected parts of a plant, more potent defense system is activated against the secondary infection. Consequently, the whole plant may exert a more strongly defense system against pathogens. This defense system is called as "SAR"  (systemic acquired resistance). The SAR may be sustained for several weeks or more and the plants exhibit some resistance to a variety of other unrelated pathogens [Hunt, M. D., Neuenschwander, LT. H., Delaney, T. P., Weymann, K. B., Friedrich, L. B., Lawton, K. A., Steiner, H. Y. and Ryals, J. A. 1996. Recent advances in systemic acquired resistance research a review. Gene 19:89-95].      In addition, ISR (induced systemic resistance) and wound response to harmful insects were reported as the types of another plant resistance [Pieterse, C. M., van Wees, S. C., van Pelt, J. A., Knoester, M., Laan, R., Gerrits, H., Weisbeek, P. J. and van Loon, L. C. 1998. A novel signaling pathway controlling induced systemic resistance in Arabidopsis. Plant Cell 10:1571-1580; Ryan, C. A. and Pearce, G.  1998. SYSTEMIN: a polypeptide signal for plant defensive genes. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.  Biol. 14:1-17].   The mechanism of the plant disease resistance is triggered by elicitors that induce the plant defense system [Kessmann, H., Staub, T., Hofmann, C., Maetzke, T., Herzog, J., Ward, E., Uknes, S. and Ryals, J. 1994. Induction of systemic acquired disease resistance in plants by chemicals. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 32:439-459]. The typical elicitors of SAR include a phenolic signaling compound SA (salicylic acid) produced by plants, elicitin and harpin that are isolated from pathogens [Ponchet, M., Panabieres, F., Milat, M. L., Mikes, V., Montillet, J. L., Suty, L., Triantaphylides, C., Tirilly, Y. and Blein, J. P. 1999. Are elicitins cryptograms in plant-oomycete communications. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 56:1020-1047].      Harpin is a common name for proteins produced from hrp gene island of plant pathogenic bacteria and one of Harpins, called HrpN, is a protein produced from l2rpN gene located at hYp gene island of about 40kb of EYZViYIiIZ  anzylov~ra which is not existing in Korea. When the HrpN is inoculated to host plants, such as an apple, it acts as a pathogenic factor. In contrast, when HrpN is given to non-host plants, it is recognized as a foreign compound in plants and HR is elicited. HrpN is an acidic, heat-stable (100 °C ) protein with a molecular weight of 44 kDa [The molecular weight was measured in a manner such that after electrophoresis on acrylamide gel, the protein was stained with 0.025 % Coomassie Blue R-250 and compared with Molecular Weight Standard of Bio-Rad Co. (Catalog# 161-0305, Bio-Rad Laboratories, 2000 Alfred Nobel Drive Hercules, CA 94547, USA)] with glycine-rich but without cysteine [thong-Min, W., Laby, R. J., Zumoff, C. H., Bauer, D. W., He, S. Y., Collmer, A. and Beer, S. V. 1992. harpin, elicitor of the hypersensitive response produced by the plant pathogen Erwiyiia a~nylovora.  Science 257:85-88; US Pat. Nos. 6,001,959, 5,850,015, 6,172,184-B1, 6,174,717-B1, 5,849,868, 6,977,060, 5,859,324, and5,776,889; Korea Examined Pat. Appl. Nos. 1999-02257, 2000-075771, 2000-070495, and 2000-057395].     These plant defense elicitors have been sold in a variety of formulations.      Since SA (Salicylic acid) has been reported as SAR elicitor, INA (2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid) and BTH (benzothiadiazole) having a similar structure to SA were found to induce SAR and successfully registered as plant activators.      Currently, ActigardTM and BION~, have been sold in US and Europe for the protection of diseases of foliage plants, tomato and tobacco. In Japan, PBZ (probenazole) under the trade name Oryzemate~ has been also marketed for controlling rice blight and bacterial leaf blight [Yoshioka, K., Nakashita, H., Klessig, D. F. and yamaguchi, I. 2001. Probenazole induces systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis with a novel type of action. Plant J. 25:149-157].   HrpN, a non-chemical protein, was first discovered in Erzainia anZylovora, a gram-negative bacteria that cause fire blight of rosaceous plants. When it is directly sprayed to plants, it acts as the SAR elicitor which controls a variety of a plant diseases, several insects, mites and nematodes and exhibits a plant growth prompting effect by enhancing photosynthesis and nutritional absorption [bong, H. S., Delaney, T. P., Bauer, D. W. and Beer, S. V. 1999. HrpN induces disease resistance in Arabidopsis through the systemic acquired resistance pathway mediated by salicylic acid and the NIM1 gene. Plant J. 20:207-215]. Also, HrpN has little toxicity and it does not cause ~-any environmental pollution as it is biologically degradable and it is easy to formulate due to heat-resistance even after boiling at 100 °C [thong-Min, W., Laby, R. J., Zumoff, C. H., Bauer, D. W., He, S. Y., Collmer, A. and Beer, S. V. 1992. Harpin, elicitor of the hypersensitive response produced by the plant pathogen Erzvinia amylovora. Science 257:85-88].      Therefore, HrpN derived from Erzvinia anaylovora was successfully commercialized in 2000 by Eden Bioscience in the trade marker Messenger~ in USA for controlling the diseases of crops, such as cotton, tomato, tobacco, pepper, cucumber, strawberry, and wheat. It has been effectively utilized as fungicide, bactericide, pesticide, and plant growth facilitator [US Pat. Nos. 6,174,717 B1, 5,849,868, 6,977,060, 5,859,324, and 5,776,889; Korea Examined Pat. Appl. Nos. 1999-02257, 2000-075771, 2000-070495, and 2000-057395].      DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION  The inventor et al. isolated and identified some bacterial pathogens from the infected lesions of a plant showing necrosis in pear growing orchards in Chunchon, Korea and found novel species, Erwinia py~~ifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) which is morphologically different from recently reported Erzuinia pyrifoliae by German researchers: that is, Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) does not have flagella, while Erzuinia pyrifoliae, which was reported by a German research team has peritrichous flagella. Also, it was different from the well-known Erzuinia arnylovora causing fire blight.    After isolating a gene and a protein which induce a hypersensitive response in non-host plants from novel species, Erzuis2ia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283), it was noted that the protein was proven to be more effective in imparting plant disease resistance against pathogens and insects, and in enhancing plant growth than HrpN from Erzuinia amylovora causing fire blight. Thus, the present invention was completed.    Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel species Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) and a protein derived from the pathogen as an effective biopesticide, a plant growth activator, a seed-treating agent, an insect repllent, and a fertilizer.    A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a gene (KCCM 10282) encoding a protein or polypeptide of Erzuinia pyrifoliae in a non-infectious form to plants, which induces a hypersensitive reaction to non-hosts or resistance to pathogens in plants when plant cells are in contact with or treated with the gene.      A further aspect of the present invention is to provide transformants containing a gene (KCCM 10282) encoding a protein or polypeptide in a 5, non-infectious form to plants from Erwinia pyrifolie~e WT#3 (KCCM 10283).      A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a biopesticidal composition containing the protein or polypeptide and a carrier.  A further aspect of the present invention is to provide the composition which can be applied to plants as a pesticide, a plant growth activator, a seed-treating agent, insect repellent, and a fertilizer.      A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a protein or polypeptide that induces a hypersensitive response or resistance on a mass-scale by isolating and purifying a protein or a polypeptide from a cultures of Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) and transformants containing a plant HR-inducing gene of the strain (KCCM 10282) from Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283).      The novel Erzvinin pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) of the present invention was isolated from the affected stem of a plant showing necrosis of pears orchard in Chunchon (Kangwon Province, Korea). The strain was identified as the genus Erzvinia, the same genus of the causal pathogen of fire blight, Erzvinia amylovorcz and necrotic disease, Erzvinia pyrifoliae (necrotic disease of Asian pears;  Erwinia pyrifoliae reported by a German research team in 1999). Erwinia amylovora and Erwir2ia pyrifoliae are peritrichous flagella, while our pathogen Ea~zvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM  10283) is non-flagellated, showing a great morphological difference from Erzvinia pyrifolir~e which is oWy found in Korea. We designated the novel strain as Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) and deposited it to the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on June 11, 2001 and was assigned with Accession No. KCCM 10283.      Especially, an isolated gene encoding a protein which induces a hypersensitive response in non-host plants from Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was compared with a hrpN gene encoding a HrpN protein, which was discovered by Cornell University of the US and sold by Eden Bioscience co. As a result, our novel gene showed less similarity to hrpN gene encoding a HrpN. Notably, several insertions of nucleotide sequences fragments were found in the gene encoding a protein which induces a hypersensitive response in non-host plants from Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 which are not present in hrpN gene from E. anaylovora. More specifically, those nucleotide sequences fragments were inserted at the sites of 222-230 bp, 249-263 bp, 348-371 by and 397-411 bp. Therefore, the protein or polypeptide produced by the gene has a different amino acid sequence and molecular weight from those of HrpN peptide.      A recombinant pKEP3 for higher expression containing the gene derived from the Erzoinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was constructed and transformed to Escherichia coli. This transformant was deposited to the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on June 11, 2001, and was assigned with Accession No. KCCM 10282. The high yield of a protein or a polypeptide to elicit hypersensitive response and disease resistance can be produced by mass cultivation of the E. coli transformant containing the expression vector having more effective properties, such as improved resistance to plant disease, promotion of a plant growth, and repellence of insect in compared to that of HrpN from E. amylovo~~a. As a result, evaluation of biological activities of the protein or polypeptide inducing hypersensitive response or plant disease resistance proved its improved effectiveness than those of HrpN in the powdery mildew of cucumber, anthracnose on pepper, blight of pepper, downy mildew of oriental melon, blight of sweet pepper, leaf blight of rice. Further, yield of harvesting showed higher cucumber, pepper, sweet pepper, and strawberry than HrpN protein. Also, the protein or polypeptide which induces a hypersensitive response in non-host plants from Erzuinia ~yrifoliae WT#3 showed an excellent in increasing the photosynthesis and the content of chlorophylls in cucumbers and peppers. Therefore, the protein or polypeptide from Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 can be applied to plants as a pesticide, a plant growth activator, and a fertilizer.    In addition, the protein or polypeptide of this invention can be applied to plants as an insect repellent (e.g., aphid) in a conventional procedure to treat stems and leaves of a plant. Further, the seeds of rice treated with a protein or a polypeptide of this invention showed fast growth during the seeding culture period. Thus, the protein or polypeptide of this invention can be applied to plants as an insect repellent and seed-treating agent in a conventional procedure.

Overall, the analytical results showed that the physiological tests on the strain (e.g., liquefaction of gelatin, motility in 3% agar, and decomposition of pectate) were close to those of type strain Epl6T of Erzvinia pyrifoliae. In contrast, the biochemical tests for the utilization of carbon source revealed different results, especially trehalose and L-arabinose, suggesting that the physiological and biochemical properties of the isolated strain according to the present invention were different from those of type strain Erzvinia pyrifoliae Epl6Tand Erzuinia anaylovora ATCC 15580T. 2) Morphological property of strain WT#3 The morphological property of the strain WT#3 was observed by TEM (Transmitted Electro Microscope), was different from that of recently reported Erzvinia pyrifoliae EP16T causing necrotic disease in Asian pear trees and Erwinia amylovoz~a ATCC 15580T causing fire blight on apples and pears [Fig.1].      As a result, Erzvinia spp. including Erwinia pyrifoliae EP16T and Erwinia anaylovora ATCC 15580T were rod shaped with peritrichous flagella whereas the novel strain Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was a slight oval rod shaped "without flagella". 3) Growth of the strain WT#3 at different temperatures To investigate the physiological and biological properties, growth curve of Es~zvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 at different temperatures was performed and the growth was measured by turbidity using Bioscreen C.      The temperatures ranging from 12 C to 39 C were measured at intervals of 3 C and doubling time and specific growth rate at different temperatures of Erzvinia pyYifoliae WT#3 and Erzvinia ar~zylovora ATCC 15580T were calculated [Fig. 2].  The results showed Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 has higher growth rate (2~-30 C ) with short doubling time than that of Erzvinia anrylovora. The optimal temperature was 27 C for the strain WT#3.      At lower temperatures below 20 C, Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 also showed a better growth compared to Erzvinia a~nylovos~a ATCC15580T, suggesting that Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 is a cold tolerant because this pathogen is well adapted in the vicinity of Chunchon. Chunchon is a relatively cold area in the winter season and has different environmental conditions from that of EPZUirlia arrrylovora ATCC15580T. 4) Growth of the strain WT#3 at different pH levels To investigate the effects of pH on the growth of Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 the growth at different pH levels was measured by turbidity using Bioscreen C. The pH  
  ranging from pH 5.5 to 9.5 was measured at intervals of 0.5 at a constant temperature of 28 C and doubling time and specific growth rate at different pH levels of Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 and Erzuinia amylovora ATCC15580T were calculated [Fig. 3].      The results showed that the optimal pH range for the growth of Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was between pH 7.0 and 8.0 and its rapid growth was observed in an alkaline condition of pH 7.5 which was different from that of Erwinia amylovora ATCC15580T. 5 Property of strain WT#3 usin Bg- iolog-system ~ Biolog system [BIOLOG, Hayward, CA 94545, USA] designed to monitor the utilization of 96 different carbon and nitrogen sources was applied to investigate the biochemical property of strain WT#3 in detail.   After incubatiomin TSA (triptic soy agar) at 28 C for ~4 hours, the isolated strain was suspended to the turbidity of 63% in a solution containing 0.4%  sodium chloride, 0.03 % pluronic F=68, and 0.01 % gellan gum and inoculated to the wells containing 96 different carbon and nitrogen sources.  Then, the strain WT#3 was further cultivated in an incubator at 35-37 C . The violet-turned as utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources were recorded using a reader and their values were numerically divided.      As shown in Fig. 4, strains ATCC15580, LMG2068, LMG1877, LMG1946 and ea246 strains (USA), which belong to Erzuinia aa~iylovora, were showed to be in the same group. In contrast, the strain WT#3 was in the group as Erzuinia pyrifoliae (Ep4, EpB, Epl6T). Therefore, it was clear that the strain WT#3 is different from the source of fire blight pathogen, E. amylovora. 6) Analysis of 16S rRNA gene from strain WT#3 To investigate the phylogenetic analysis of the strain WT#3, the nucleotide sequence of its 16S rRNA gene was analyzed considering the fact that it is an essential component to manage a life where its nucleotide sequence is well conserved and can be readily placed for phylogenetic analysis.  
  The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using fD1 primer (SEQ. ID. No. 1) and rP2 primer (SEQ. ID. No. 2) and then cloned into pGEM-T vector to analyze its nucleotide sequence.      Fig. 5 shows a phylogenic tree prepared by a mega program [Kumar, S., Tamura, K. and Nei, M. 1993. MEGA: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis, version 1Ø The Pennsylvania State University, University Park] based on the rRNA nucleotide sequence.     The strain WT#3 had similarities to Erzvinia pyrifoliae Epl6T and Erzvinia arnylovora 15580T with 98.9% and 97.5% sequence identity, respectively, being more closer to Erzvinia pyrifoliae than to Erzuinia amylovora. Table 2 shows the similarity of 16S rRNA gene of each strain.

  Analysis for 16S-23S ITS (Interg_enic Transcribed Spacer) re~-ion of strain WT#3 To analyze the ITS of the Korea-originated pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and foreign-originated Erwinia amylovoz~a,16S-23S ITS region was amplified by PCR  using R16-1F primer (SEQ. ID. No. 3) and R23-1R primer (SEQ. ID. No. 4), and then cloned into pGEM-T vector to analyze the nucleotide sequence of 16S-23S ITS region.      As a result, 16S-23S ITS region was divided into two groups; Erwinia aanylovora had three band patterns with about 1215, 970 and X20 by in size, whereas domestic pathogen, Erzvinia pyz~ifoliae had two band patterns with 970 and 720 by in size. ~ Currently, all strains were showed two groups; the band pattern of 970 by had about 70 by region of tRNAAIa, whereas the band pattern of 720bp had a region of tRNAolu, respectively.      Fig. 6 shows a phylogenic tree prepared by analyzing the nucleotide sequences of 16S-23S ITS region of both the strain Erwir~ia pyrifoliae WT#3 and Erzuinia amylovora ATCC15580T.    As a result of analyzing the nucleotide sequences of a 970 by band encoding 70bp regions of tRNAAIa, it was revealed that the strain WT#3 is different from Erzvinia amylovora group and had a similarity of 47.4 % to Erzvinia asnylovora. However, we could not compare with tRNA~a region of Erzainia pyrifoliae, which was designated by German researchers because it was not registered in GenBank.     The analysis of the nucleotide sequences of a 720 by band encoding tRNAGiu region showed that the strain Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 has 85.2%- 92.7% of sequence identity to that of Erwinia pyrifoliae reported by ~ German researchers, thus being suggested as the same group [Fig. 7]. ~) Analysis of Erzvinia ~~/ri foliae WT#3 according to plasmid profiles The Korea-originated Ez~zvinia pyrifoliae and foreign-originated Erwinia amylovora were divided into the following two groups [Fig. 8].      Group I: Erzvinia amylovora (ATCC15580, LMG1877, 10296) (a plasmid > 29 kb) Group II: Erwinia pyrifoliae (WT#3, Epl, Epl6) (a plasmid > 29 kb, a plasmid 5 kb, and three plasmids 2-4 kb in size) That is, the necrotic disease pathogens, Erzuinia pyrifoliae, on Asian pear trees including the strain WT#3 have five plasmids, whereas fire blight pathogens, Erwinia amylovora, have only one plasmid, respectively. 9) Analysis for DNA relatedness according to DNA-DNA hybridization The relatedness in whole genome between the Korea-originated Erzuinia ~yrifoliae and foreign-originated Erwinia amylovora were was investigated.      The purely isolated total DNA was dissolved in 100,tc.~ TE buffer to a concentration 1ng/,cc~, added with 10N NaOH, and then denatured by boiling at for 10 min. Denatured DNA was applied to Hybond-N~ nylon membrane using a slot-blot apparatus. Native DNA to be used as a probe was labeled with DIG 11-dUTP by Dig-High Prime [Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sandhofer Strasse 116, Germany], prehybridized at 49 C for 3 hours in the presence of DNA already fixed to a nylon membrane, and then hybridized for 16 hours at the same temperature.    Development of the membranes was conducted by DIG Luminescent Detection Kit [Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sandhofer Strasse 116, Germany]. The result showed that the foreign-originated Erzuinia arnylovora (ATCC15580T, LMG1877, LMG1946, LMG2068) belong to group I while Korea-originated Erwinia ~yrifoliae (WT#3, Epl6T) belong to group lI .      More specifically, the foreign-originated pathogens, Erzuinia amylovora belonged to group I but the Korea-originated pathogens, Erzuinia pyrifoliae belonged to group II. This result clearly indicates that the Korean pathogens, Erzuinia pyrifoliae including strain WT#3 and the foreign pathogens, Erwinia amylovora were distinct, suggesting that Erzuinia pyrifoliae is native to Korea. The following table 3 shows the similarities of related strains.     Table 3 Source of unlabeledDNA hybridization (%) DNA from:       Ea~zuinia amylovoraErzuinia pyrifoliaeErzuinia pyrifoliae ATCC 15580T     WT#3            Epl6T     Erzuinia amylovora LMG1946         102             11       1 ~     Erwinia pyrifoliae Epl6T           61      88              100 WT#3            45              100 102 From the above physiological, biochemical and genetic properties of the strain WT#3, it was noted that, in terms of physiological and biochemical properties based on Schaad's laboratory guide and Bergey's manual, temperature and pH level-related properties, Biolog system,16S rRNA gene,16S-23S ITS, plasmid profiles, and relatedness by DNA-DNA hybridization, the strain WT#3 was in the group of Erzuisiia pyrifoliae, which was present only in Korea in 1999, although there were a few other different properties between Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 and Epl6T.      However, since the strain WT#3 does not have flagella in morphology which is first reported in genus Erzuinia, it appears to be different from those of pathogen, Erzuinia pyrifoliae, which was reported by German researchers and Erwinia amylovora.     We designated the strain WT#3 as Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) and deposited to the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on June 11, 2001. The accession number is KCCM 10283. Also; a recombinant pKEP3 for higher expression containing the gene derived from the Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was constructed and transformed to Escherichia coli. This transformant was deposited to the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on June 11, 2001, and was assigned with Accession No. KCCM 10282.     Example 2: Properties of specific protein triggering a plant hypersensitive reaction from Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 and a gene encoding it 1 Analysis of a plant HR-inducin~~~ene from Erzvinia p~rifoliae WT#3 To analyze a gene encoding specific protein eliciting a plant hypersensitive response, total DNA of Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was 'incubated at 3~ C to ensure that it was partially digested with Sau3AI. The DNA (1 ,u,~) was then examined for appropriate digestion on an electrophoresis at the .intervals of 1 hr, and the result revealed that about 6 hours of digestion was most appropriate. Total DNA, so manipulated, was ~ prepared as an insertion DNA and ligated into the BamHI polylinker site of cloning vector pLAFR3 using DNA ligase by incubating at 14 C for 12 hours. A complete plasmid DNA ligated with the insertion DNA and a vector was transformed to E. coli (HB101) via CaCl2 transformation. Then, E.coli strains were cultivated on Luria agar medium containing tetracycline (30 mg/ m.~) at 37 C  for 24 hours and 2,000 genomic library clones were generated. To select clones encoding the specific protein eliciting a plant hypersensitive reaction from the 2,000 genomic DNA library clones of Erzoinia pyrifoliae WT#3, total protein was extracted from each clone as follows. The solution, so cultured in LB medium for 12 hours, was centrifuged to obtain a pellet and after suspending the pellet in the mixture containing 5 mM MES buffer and 0.1 mM PMSF, the mixture was lysed by sonication and boiled at 100 C for 10 min. Then, the supernatant only, so centrifuged, was collected and injected to the reverse sides of tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum L. Samsun) using a syringe, which were grown with more than four true leaves with each leaf having a diameter of more than 15 cm. The necrosis of tobacco leaves 24 hours after injection was regarded as the HR and then genomic DNA library clones showing HR were selected [Fig. 9].      From the selected clone pCEP33, an ~.5 kb DNA fragment containing the HR-inducing gene was cloned to pUCl9 vector and a physical map was constructed using a restriction endonuclease [Fig.10].     Fig. 11 compares a gene (KCCM 10282) encoding the plant HR-inducing protein from Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) of the present invention with the HR-inducing gene (hrpN)~ from Erzvinia amylovora ATCC15580T by analyzing the nucleotide sequences from the selected gene.      From Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 of this invention, a 128 by gene encoding a protein of plant hypersensitive response can be obtained. The 1287 by gene was designated as "a plant HR-inducing gene from WT#3" and its similarity to hrpN  gene of Erztinia amylovora ATCC15580T (1212 bp) was investigated.      As a result, it WaS ShOWl1 that five novel nucleotide sequences fragments were inserted to the plant HR-inducing gene of WT#3 at the sites of 222-230 by (TTTAACGGG), 249-263 by (TGGCGGCGGTCTGCT), 327-333 by (TCTGGGT), 348-371 by (CGGCATTGGCGGCGGCATTGGTGG), and 397-411 by (ACCGTGGGGACCTCT), thus resulting in the increase in the molecular weight of the gene. The plant HR-inducing gene from WT#3 had a low sequences similarity of 83.2% homology to l2rpN gene of Erzvinia amylovora.  Therefore, it demonstrated that the gene encoding the plant HR-inducing protein of Erzvinia pyrifoliae WT#3 has a different nucleotide sequences from hrpN gene of Erzvinia anzylovora and also has the insertions of novel nucleotide sequences fragments, thus showing that the plant HR-inducing gene from WT#3 has a novel gene structure which is not found in hrpN gene of Erzvinia amylovora.     The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the plant HR-inducing protein of Erzc~inia pyrifoliae WT#3 was denoted as SEQ. ID. No. 5.  Construction of expression vector of a plant HR-inducing-protein from Erwinia p~/rifoliae WT#3 To extract and purify a plant hypersensitive response eliciting protein on a large scale from the plant HR inducing gene of Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3, an expression vector pKEP3 containing the gene was constructed as follows:      Recombinant protein expression system in E.coli (Novagen, Inc. Madison, WI53711 USA) was employed so as to construct the expression vector pKEP3. This system was derived from pBR322 plasmid, where T7 promoter and operator can bind to lac repressor before the insertion site of a foreign gene. This structure can easily facilitate the expression of an inserted gene in a larger volume by T7 RNA polymerase produced in a host E.coli genome. Notably, when a substrate IPTG 3 hours after incubation is added, the combination of both lac repressor produced from lacl gene and IPTG does not repress the expression of T7 RNA polymerase and thus, a larger amount of protein is synthesized. For the selection of complete transformants, pKEP3 was constructed to contain an ampicillin-resistance gene and ampicillin can be used to the medium as a selective marker.    The gene encoding a plant HR-inducing protein from Erzainia pyrifoliae WT#3 and the plasmid of recombinant protein expression system were digested at 3'7 C for 12 hrs in the presence of the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI to generate the same 5'- and 3'-end. They were then ligated into the restriction sites using DNA ligase at 14 C for 16 hrs and transferred into E.coli via CaCl2transformation. pKEP3 has many advantages that (1) ampicillin-resistant gene can be used as a selected marker, (2) its possession with His tag may make an easier purification, and (3) its possession of a strong T7 lac promoter may ensures a larger volume of protein production from ligated insertion DNA.      The E. coli transformant containing the expression vector pKEP3 was deposited to the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on June 11, 2001 and was assigned with the Accession No. KCCM 10282.      In the present invention, hrpN gene of Erzvi~ia amylovora ATCC15580T was cloned by using the same recombinant protein expression system (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI 53711, USA) and used as a control for the biological test of pKEP3, which contains novel plant HR-inducing gene from Erzoinia pyrifoliae WT#3. 3) Expression of a plant HR-inducing_protein To produce a large-scale protein from E. coli transformants containing pKEP3 (KCCM 10282) bacterial cells were inoculated to a LB broth by adding ampicillin (50 ~tg/ m.~) as a selective marker and chloramphenicol (33 ~tg/ m.~) for inhibiting the synthesis of other proteins produced from E.coli genome, and subcultured at 37 C     for 12 hours. Then, the bacterial transformant (KCCM 10282) of the present invention was cultured at 30 C for ~ hours using the same medium. When the O.D. of the transformant (KCCM 10282) reached 0.6 about 3 hours after the cultivation, the culture was added with 0.4 mM IPTG and cooled down to 30 C and then cultured again for 4 hours. After a total of 7 hours cultivation, the mixture was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 15 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded and a pellet was suspended in a solution containing 5 rnM MES buffer and 0.1 mM PMSF. The suspension of transformant (KCCM 10282) was lysed by sonication until the suspension became transparent and then boiled for 10 min at 100 C . Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded. After adding a protein inhibitory cocktail at the ratio of 1/1,000, the mixture was filtrated by using a 0.45 ~m filter and weighed the extract amount of protein.      Through the above-mentioned process, the plant HR-inducing protein producing from transformant encoding the plant HR-inducing gene (KCCM 10282) of Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 was named as'Pioneer'.      According to the present invention, ha~pN gene of Erwinia amylovora ATCC15580T was cloned by the same recombinant protein expression system (Novagen, Inc. Madison, WI53~11 USA) and used as a control for the biological test of Pioneer. As shown in Fig. 12, it was demonstrated that both genes of Erzuinia pyrifoliae WT#3 and Erzuinia amylovora ATCC15580T encoding plant HR-inducing protein were successfully expressed by the recombinant protein expression system and were synthesized a large volume of a plant HR-inducing proteins. ~ Analysis for the similarity of plant HR-inducing_protein (Pioneer The similarity of Pioneer was compared with the HR-inducing protein of Erzuinia amylovora ATCC15580T by analyzing the amino acid sequence of purified Pioneer [Fig.13].      As a result, it was noted that novel protein domains of Pioneer were produced from the N-terminal at the sites of 76-79 (Thr-Gly-Leu-Leu), 8 8 - 9 2 ( L a a - G 1 y - G 1 y - G 1 y - S a r ) , 1 0 2 - 1 1 3 (Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Gly-Asp-Leu-Gly-Ser-Thr), and 131-137 ( G 1 y - A 1 a - T h r - V a 1 - G 1 y - T h r - S a r ) .      The Pioneer had a low amino acid sequence identity of 85.9% homology to that of HrpN. The molecular weight of Pioneer was 41.1 kD as compared with 39.7 kD of HrpN. The molecular weight of both Pioneer and HrpN was not compared with the molecular weight standards on an acrylamide gel but a molecular weight of each amino acid deduced from. the nucleotide sequence of gene using Winstar program.     Therefore, Pioneer has a novel type of a protein by the insertion of novel peptide domains and such difference is expected to bring about much improved biological activity, which cannot be found in that of HrpN. 51 Hvnersensitive response of a plant HR-inducing protein (Pioneer Until recently, the plant HR-inducing protein is known as a pathogenic factor in host plants but induces the HR in non-host plants.      Pioneer from Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 and HrpN from Erwinia amylo~ora ATCC15580T were inoculated onto tobacco (non-host plants) leaves using a syringe, together with MES buffer (protein lysis buffer) as a control [Fig.14].   As shown in Fig. 14, it was noted that Pioneer and HrpN exhibited a clear HR in the front tobacco leaf at the dose of 10 ,ug/ m.~ and 20 ~tg/ m.~, respectively; in the same reverse tobacco leaf, Pioneer and HrpN exhibited a clear HR at the dose of 5 fig/ m.~ and 10 ~cg/ m~, respectively. This reflected that Pioneer induces HR  at a relatively lower concentration than that of HrpN.      As shown in the following table 4, it revealed that when Pioneer was inoculated at the dose of 5 ~cg/ m.~ and 10 ~tg/ m.~, a clear HR was observed at 24 hours and 14 hours after inoculation, respectively, whereas HrpN induced a clear HR  at 48 hours and 18 hours after inoculation at same concentration, respectively. ~  This demonstrates that Pioneer exhibited more rapid HR than HrpN by 24 hours at of ~tg/ m.~ while Pioneer exhibited more rapid HR than HrpN by 4 hours at 10 ~tg/  m.~     respectively.    This test was repeatedly performed three times and the result suggests that Pioneer induces the immune system of a plant at a lower dose and faster than HrpN.

As shown in Fig. 15, the surface of the immature fruit turned black as a 10 progressive symptom 4 days after treatment, compared with that of a control. Therefore, Pioneer might have a potent pathogenicity on pears although it needs a further investigation.    As mentioned above, the properties of Pioneer and a gene encoding it can be summarized as follows. (1) The gene encoding Pioneer showed that several novel nucleotide sequences fragments are inserted to the several sites of Pioneer gene, which are not found in hrpN gene; the size of Pioneer gene was 1,27 by as compared with that of the gene of hrpN (1,212 bp). (2) In the protein structure, the molecular weight of Pioneer (41.1 kD) with novel peptide domains was larger than HrpN (39.7 kD) [The molecular weight of both Pioneer and HrpN were not compared with molecular weight standards on an acrylamide gel but their molecular weight for each amino acid were deduced from the nucleotide sequences of a gene using Winstar program].     (3) In the HR observed in tobacco leaves, it was noted that Pioneer induces the immune system of a plants at a lower dose and faster than HrpN.   Therefore, it is clear that Pioneer is more suitable than HrpN from Erzvinia am~loz~ora for the development of a better biopesticide eliciting the excellent HR.    Example 3: The study of biological activity using plant HR-inducing protein (Pioneer) Control effect against powdery mildew S;ahaerotheca ,-~cli i~ nea) of cucumbers To evaluate the control effect of Pioneer against powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea), a gene encoding the plant HR-inducing protein was cloned into pKEP3 vector to purify tile protein.      Cucumbers were cultivated by the conventional "rain-protecting" method prevailing in agr icultural farms. The test materials were applied based on the 3-time repeated randomized complete block design. The stems and leaves of cucumbers were treated with the HR-inducing protein, Pioneer, at a dose of 20 ~tg/m~  according to the recommended dose by EDEN Bioscience corporation.     EDEN Bioscience's Messenger~ was used as a control at the same dose above, together with locally produced Fenarimol (chemical pesticide) based on the instruction in use. The treatment methods are as follows: 0 Treatment by three times: Pioneer, Messenger~ and Fenarimol were sprayed to the stems and leaves of cucumber three times each at intervals of 10 days after early stage of powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea). ~2 Treatment by four times: Pioneer, Messenger~ and Fenarimol were sprayed to the stems and leaves of cucumber three times each at the implantation of day 7, 21, 35, and 49.      The disease severity of powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) from the upper 8 leaves to the bottom 3 leaves of cucumbers was measured 7 days after treatment based on the following criteria (0: no disease, 1: 1-5 %, 2: 5.1-20 %, 3: 20.1-40%, 4: more than 40%).

HrpN, a control, was also given to the stems and leaves of cucumbers at the same dose as aforementioned.    The cucumbers for this experiment were harvested at the implantation of day 8,10,12,14,16,18, 21, 23, 25, and 30. Under the judgment that the cucumbers with 20 cm in length can be commercialized, the results are indicated as a marketable rate as follows.

Therefore, Pioneer can be more effectively used as a plant growth activator and a fertilizer than HrpN. 3~Increase of contents in photosynthesis and chlorophyll of cucumbers To ascertain the physiological reaction of cucumbers, namely, the increase of contents in photosynthesis and chlorophyll of cucumbers, when treated with Pioneer, the stems and leaves of cucumbers were treated with Pioneer at a dose of 20 ,ug/ m.~ 5 times each at intervals of 14 days from day 7 before implantation. HrpN, a control, was also given to the stems and leaves of cucumbers at the same dose as aforementioned.    The cucumbers for this experiment were harvested at the implantation of day 34, 42 and 56 and investigated using a portable photosynthesis device (LCA-4 system, ADC BioScientific Ltd., UNK; light source: 1,500 umole) and a chlorophyll device (Chlorophyll meter SPAD-502, Minolta, Japan).

Therefore, Pioneer can be more effectively used as a repellent than HrpN.     14) Enhancement effect of growth in seeding culture of rice To ascertain the enhancement effect of growth in seeding culture of rice treated with Pioneer, a gene encoding the plant HR-inducing protein was cloned into pKEP3 vector to purify the protein. The sterns and leaves of rice were treated with Pioneer at the doses of 10, 20 and 40 ~tg/m.~, diluted at MES buffer and immerged at 28 C for 24 hrs. Rice seeds were sowed to a seedbed, grown for 16 days and implanted to a test field.  HrpN, a control, was also given to the stems and leaves of rice at the same dose and method as aforementioned. As a result, better growth in seeding culture of rice treated with Pioneer was observed by about 3~4 cm vs. non-treatment and 1 cm higher than HrpN.  A higher dose (40 ~tg/ m.~) of Pioneer was required for better enhancement of rice's growth.      Therefore, Pioneer can be more effectively used as a seed-treating agent which can promote the growth of rice seeds than HrpN.  INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY      As mentioned above, a novel Erzvinia ~yrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) according to the present invention is isolated and identified, and a novel protein (Pioneer) or a polypeptide translated from a plant HR-inducing gene (KCCM  10282) of this strain shows that Pioneer has improved properties in inducing plant resistance, plant growth promotion, insect repellent effect, increase of photosynthesis and chlorophyll, and seed treatment effect than a HrpN from E~~wi~~ia arnylovora ATCC15580T. The former readily elicits the plant hypersensitive response at a lower 35 dose and faster than HrpN, thus, the protein from Erzvivia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) is quite suitable for the development of a novel and better plant hypersensitive reaction eliciting biopesticide.      Therefore, this invention is advantageous in developing a novel and improved biopesticide and a fertilizer.
