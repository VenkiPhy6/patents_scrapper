    [0001]
     The present invention relates to recombinant
microorganisms expressing small rubber particle-associated
protein("SRPP"), more specifically, cDNA encoding the SRPP
derived from the latex of  Hevea brasiliensis,  recombinant
SRPP deduced from the cDNA, recombinant expression vectors
comprising the cDNA, recombinant microorganisms transformed
with the recombinant expression vectors and method for
synthesis of rubber using the recombinant SRPP. 
   
 Background of the Invention 
 
   
    
    [0002]
     Rubber( cis -1,4-polyisoprene), an isoprenoid polymer
with no known physiological function to the plant, is
produced in about 2,000 plant species with varying degrees
of quality and quantity ( see : Backhaus, R.A., Israel Journal
of Botany, 34:283-293(1985)). The rubber is a raw material
of choice for heavy-duty tires and other industrial uses
requiring elasticity, flexibility and resilience.  Hevea
brasiliensis  (" H. brasiliensis")  has been regarded as the
only commercial source of natural rubber mainly due to its
abundance in the tree, its quality and the ease with
harvesting. Diminishing acreage of rubber plantation and
life-threatening latex allergy to  Hevea  rubber, coupled 
with increasing demand, have concentrated research
interests in the area of rubber synthesis and development
of an alternative rubber source. 
     
    
    [0003]
     In  H. brasiliensis,  rubber synthesis takes place on
the surface of rubber particles suspended in the latex(the
cytoplasm of laticifers). The laticifers are specialized
vessels that are located adjacent to the phloem of the
rubber tree. When severed during tapping, the high tugor
pressure inside the laticifers expels latex containing 30-50%(wt/wt)
of  cis -1,4-polyisoprene. The latex may be
fractionated by centrifugation into three phases: the top
fraction containing mostly rubber particles; the middle
fraction (called C-serum) which is metabolically active
fraction; and, the bottom fraction with mainly vacuoles
called lutoids. 
     
    
    [0004]
     More than 200 expressed sequence tags have been
identified from the latex of  H. brasiliensis.  Kush et al.
have shown differential expression of several rubber
biosynthesis-related genes in latex ( see : Kush, A. et al.,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 87:1787-1790(1990)). The
rubber elongation factor("REF"), an enzyme involved rubber
biosynthesis, is highly expressed in laticifers ( see : Dennis,
M.S. and Light, D.R., J. Biol. Chem., 264:18608-17(1989);
Goyvaerts, E. et al., Plant Physiol., 97:317-321(1991)).
Laticiferous cells actively translate the transcribed genes
into proteins. Tupy et al. reported the presence of
ribosomes and polysomes in these specialised cells ( see :
Tupy et al., Plant Science, 55:137-144(1988)). Arokiaraj et 
al. observed that β-glucuronidase reporter gene introduced
by  Agrobacterium -mediated transformation was expressed in
the latex of transgenic  Hevea  plant ( see : Arokiaraj et al.,
Plant Cell Reports, 17:621-625(1998)). 
     
    
    [0005]
     Genes expressed in the latex of  Hevea  can be divided
into three groups based on their encoding proteins: 1)
Defense-related proteins such as hevein, chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase,
and  HEVER  ( see : Broeckaert et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 87:7633-7637(1990); Martin, M.N., Plant
Physiology, 95:469-476(1991); Chye, M.L. and Cheung, K.Y.,
Plan Mol. Biol., 29:397-402(1995); Sivasubramanism, S. et
al., Plant Mol. Biol., 29:173-178(1995)); 2) Rubber
biosynthesis-related proteins such as REF, HMGCoA reductase,
and farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( see : Goyvaerts, E. et al.,
Plant Physiol., 97:317-321(1991); Chye, M.L. et al., Plant
Mol. Biol., 19:473-484(1992); Adiwilaga, K. and Kush, A.,
Plant Mol. Biol., 30:935-946(1996)); and, 3) Latex
allergens (proteins) such as Hev  b  3, Hev b 4, Hev  b  5 and
Hev b 7( see : Yeang, H.Y. et al., Journal of Allergy and
clinical Immunology, 98:628-639(1996); Akasawa, A. et al.,
J. Biol. Chem., 271:25389-93(1996); Slater, J.E. et al., J.
Biol. Chem., 271:25394-9(1996); Sowka, S. et al., Eur. J.
Biochem., 255:213-9(1998)). 
     
    
    [0006]
     Rubber particles are essential components in rubber
synthesis  in vitro  ( see : Lynen, F., J. Rub. Res. Inst.
Malaya, 21:389-406(1969)). So far, most of the experiments
showing  in vitro  rubber synthesis with labeled isopentenyl
pyrophosphate ("IPP") have always required the presence of 
rubber particles. Dennis and Light had shown that REF, a
kind of rubber particle-associated protein("RPP"), was
necessary for rubber elongation  in vitro ( see : Dennis, M.S.
and Light, D.R., J. Biol. Chem., 264:18608-17(1989)). Yeang
et al. identified a 24kDa RPP(Hev b 3) tightly bound on
small rubber particles smaller than 10µm in diameter as
another latex allergen( see : Yeang, H.Y. et al., Journal of
allergy and clinical immunology, 98:628-639(1996); Yeang,
H.Y. et al., 53:513-519(1998)). In addition, Pan et al.
identified the most abundant RPP(53kDa) in guayule, another
rubber-producing plant, as a cytochrome P450 known as
allene oxide synthase ( see : Pan, Z. et al., J. Biol. Chem.,
279:8487-8494(1995)), which is also reported as an
essential protein for rubber biosynthesis( see : USP
5,633,433). 
     
    
    [0007]
     In light of these observations, it is plausible that
the surface of rubber particle is the appropriate location
for a rubber polymerase, which plays a role in polymerizing
a hydrophobic polymer into the particle interior while
obtaining hydrophilic substrates from the cytosol. As major
RPPs, both REF and SRPP could be the integral components of
the rubber biosynthesis machinery. 
     
    
    [0008]
     SRPP causes allergenic response in spina bifida
patients and only its partial amino acid sequence has been
determined( see : Yeang, H.Y. et al., Journal of allergy and
Clinical Immunology, 98:628-639(1996); Yeang, H.Y. et al.,
Allergy, 53:513-519(1998)), while the gene encoding this
protein has not been cloned yet. Isolation and 
characterization of the SRPP gene have accelerated further
study on the functions and industrial uses of SRPP. 
   
 Summary of the Invention 
 
   
    
    [0009]
     In accordance with the present invention, the

SRPP related to rubber synthesis, and cloned full length
cDNA coding for SRPP from latex cDNA library of  H.
brasiliensis  and determined the amino acid sequence deduced
from the genes. Further, the inventors constructed
expression vectors comprising the SRPP cDNA and recombinant
microorganisms transformed therewith, finally to confirm a

 Detailed Description of the Invention 
 
   
    
    [0016]
     The present inventors isolated a cDNA clone encoding
24kDa of small rubber particle-associated protein("SRPP"),
known as Hev b3 protein, from latex cDNA library of  H.
brasiliensis,  where the SRPP tightly binds on small rubber
particle whose size is less than 10µm in diameter. Then,
the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA was
determined, which revealed that: SRPP cDNA is 910bp long,
and contains 83bp 5'-UTR(untranslated region), 615bp
ORF(open reading frame) and 212bp 3'-UTR including 18bp
poly A tail. A putative polyadenylation signal(AATAA)
beginning at 794 th  position was also identified. The ORF
encodes 204 amino acids of protein with a predicted
molecular mass of approximately 22.4kDa. Analysis of the
SRPP revealed that it is a hydrophobic and acidic protein
with an isoelectric point of 4.8 and located in cytoplasm.
The SRPP exhibits 72% sequence similarity to REF(GenBank
Accession No. P15252), 68% sequence similarity to stress-related
protein of  P .  vulgaris (PvSRP, GenBank Accession No.
1326163) and 48% sequence similarity to  Arabidopsis
thaliana  FIN21.4(GenBank Accession No. 2670320), Sequence
alignment indicates that there is highly conserved regions
from amino acid number 38 to 65 with no match to any known
functional domains. 
     
    
    [0017]
     Recombinant expression vectors pGEX-SRPP and pRSET-SRPP
provided by this invention were constructed by cloning
of the 910bp SRPP cDNA either in the  EcoR I- Xho I site of 
pGEX or in the  BamH I- Pvu II site of pRSET, In the pGEX-SRPP,
glutathione S-transferase(GST)-SRPP fusion protein is
expressed under the control of isopropyl-β-thiogalacto
pyranoside(IPTG)-inducible  tac  promoter; and, in the pRSET-SRPP,
SRPP is independently expressed under the control of
T7 promoter. Each of transformants thus prepared was
designated as  'Escherichia coli  XL1 Blue/pGEX-SRPP' and
 'Escherichia coli  XL1 Blue/pRSET-SRPP', and deposited with
the Korean Collection for Type Cultures(KCTC, #52, Oun-dong,
Yusong-gu, Taejon 305-333, Republic of Korea), an
international depository authority as accession No. KCTC
0595BP and KCTC 0596BP on March 30, 1999. 
     
    
    [0018]
     In accordance with the conventional method, the
recombinant  E .  coli  XL1 Blue/pGEX-SRPP or XL1 Blue/pRSET-SRPP
was grown in Luria Broth("LB") media containing
ampicillin, homogenated after IPTG induction, centrifuged
and the supernatant containing recombinant SRPP was
collected. 
     
    
    [0019]
     Rubber can be easily produced  in vitro  by the
addition of the recombinant SRPP thus obtained to a rubber
synthesis reaction mixture containing rubber particles.
Preferably, rubber can be manufactured by adding  Hevea
brasiliensis  latex or washed rubber particle(WRP) and the
recombinant SRPP to a reaction buffer solution where
protein degradation is inhibited, and incubating at 20 to
37°C for 2 to 12 hours. Under the consideration of
manufacturing efficiency, the addition of concentrated
recombinant SRPP is more preferable since productivity is 
highly dependent on the concentration of recombinant SRPP.
The recombinant SRPP can be expressed in a host cell of a
plant, a bacteria, a yeast or a fungus which is transformed
with the expression vectors comprising a cDNA encoding
SRPP(SEQ ID NO:2) in a form of fusion protein with another
protein or non-fusion protein. Both SRPP fusion protein and
non-fusion protein may be used for rubber synthesis
reaction. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the
host cell homogenate may directly be used for the rubber
synthesis without further purification. 
     
    
    [0020]
     The present invention is further illustrated by the
following examples, which should not be taken to limit the
scope of the invention. 
     Example 1 : Construction of cDNA library of  H .  brasiliensis 
latex 
   Example 1-1 : Construction of cDNA library 
   
    
    [0021]
     Latex and leaves were obtained from mature rubber
plants( H .  brasiliensis  RRIM600) growing at the Rubber
Research Institute of Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia. Latex
exuding from the tapped trees was collected while
continuously mixing it with an equal volume of 2X RNA
extraction buffer(0.1M Tris HCl, pH 9.5, containing 0.3M
LiCl, 0.01M EDTA, 10% SDS) either at ambient temperature or
on ice. The collected samples were frozen in liquid 
nitrogen. 
     
    
    [0022]
     RNA extraction from latex was performed analogously as
in Kush et al's method ( see : Kush, A. et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 87:1787-1790(1990)) using the Qiagen
RNeasy Plant Minikit(Qiagen Inc., U.S.A.). Poly (A) +  RNA
was isolated using Oligotex-dT™ mRNA Kit(Qiagen Inc.,
U.S.A.). The cDNA library was constructed in an Uni-ZAP II
phage vector according to the supplier's instructions
(Stratagene, U.S.A.) using Poly(A) +  RNA prepared from the
latex. As a result, the cDNA library containing about 5 ×
10 7  recombinant phages was constructed. 
     Example 1-2 : Screening of cDNA library 
   
    
    [0023]
     In a subtracted cDNA library(latex leaf), the
inventors identified an expressed sequence tag(EST) whose
deduced amino acid matches with the known partial sequence
of  Hev b  3. From the sequence of the EST, a PCR primer( see :
SEQ ID NO:1) corresponding to the sequences from +185 to
+211 bp in SRPP was designed. This primer(upstream) and T7
primer(downstream) were used to amplify SRPP genes from the
cDNA library obtained from Example 1-1. PCR was performed
for 30 cycles of 30sec at 94°C, 30sec at 50°C, and 2min at
72°C, with a 5min pre-heat and 10min final extension at 72°C.
The 500bp-SRPP DNA fragment obtained from the PCR was
employed as a probe for the screening of cDNA library which
is diluted by a factor of 10 2 . From the screening, 10
positive clones containing about 0.8 to 1.0kb insert DNA 
were detected from agarose gel electrophoresis after
digestion with  EcoR I. One clone carrying approximately
1.0Kb DNA insert was selected for subcloning. According to
the supplier's instruction of cDNA library kit(Stratagene,
U.S.A.) used in Example 1-1, phagemid containing 1.0kb DNA
was excised from the Uni-ZAP II phage vector. The phagemid
was designated as "pSRPP". 
     Example 1-3 : Sequence analysis of cDNA clone 
   
    
    [0024]
     For the cDNA sequence analysis of the pSRPP, plasmid
DNA of  E .  coli  XL-1 Blue/pSRPP was prepared by the alkaline
lysis method ( see : Sambrook J. et al., Molecular cloning, A
laboratory manual, 2 nd  edition: Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory Press(1989)) using Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA
Purification System kit(Promega, U.S.A.). The sequencing
reaction was performed with the ALFexpress AutoRead
Sequencing kit(Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) using the
fluorescent dye-labeled M13 universal or reverse
primer(provided by the kit). The nucleotide sequences were
obtained by electrophoresis on an ALF automatic
sequencer(Perkin-Elmer, U.S.A.). The sequence analysis
showed that DNA fragment inserted to pSRPP is 910bp
long(SEQ ID NO:2) and contains 83bp 5'-UTR, 615bp ORF and
212bp 3'-UTR including poly A tail of 18bp. A putative
polyadenylation signal (AATAA) beginning at bp 794 th  position
was also identified ( see : Figure 1) . 
     
    
    [0025]
     The nucleotide sequence(SEQ ID NO:2) encodes 204-amino 
acids( see : SEQ ID NO:3) with a predicted molecular mass of
22.4kDa ( see : Figure 1). The deduced protein is acidic with
an isoelectric point of 4.8 which is similar to that of
REF(pI=5.04). Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid
sequence revealed that SRPP has a hydrophobic nature( see :
Figure 2). Transmembrane region analysis using TMpred
algorithm indicated that the SRPP does not have
transmembrane helices large enough to span the lipid
bilayers. A computer analysis by the PSORT program(K. Nakai,
Osaka University, Japan) for protein localization sites
suggests that the SRPP is localized in cytoplasm
(certainty=0.65). 
     
    
    [0026]
     The computer analysis using Clustal W program shows
that the predicted amino acid sequence of the SRPP has a
high similarity to those of REF(72% in the paired sequence
region, accession No. P15252),  P .  vulgaris  stress-related
protein(PvSRP, 68% in the paired sequence region, accession
No. 1326163), and  A. thaliana  FIN21.4(48% in the paired
sequence region, accession No. 2670320). PvSRP is believed
to be involved in defense mechanism and induced by stress
or wounding. The function of the  Arabidopsis  gene FIN21 is
not known. Sequence alignment indicates that there is a
highly conserved region from the amino acid number 38 to 65
with no match to any known functional domains( see : Figure
3).  
     Example 2 : Expression of recombinant SRPP 
   
    
    [0027]
     The cDNA of SRPP was excised from the pSRPP of Example
1-3 with  EcoR I and  Xho I for construction of SRPP expression
vector. Recombinant expression vector pGEX-SRPP or pRSET-SRPP
was constructed by cloning of the SRPP cDNA either in
the  EcoR I- Xho I site of pGEX(Pharmacia, Sweden) or in the
 BamH I- Pvu II site of pRSET(Invitrogen, U.S.A.)( see : Figures
4a and 4b). In the pGEX-SRPP, glutathione S-transferase(GST)-SRPP
fusion protein is expressed under the
control of isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG)-inducible
 tac  promoter and in the pRSET-SRPP, SRPP is independently
expressed under the control of T7 promoter. Each of
transformants thus prepared was designated as  'Escherichia
coli  XL1 Blue/pGEX-SRPP' and  'Escherichia coli  XL1
Blue/pRSET-SRRPP', and deposited with the Korean Collection
for Type Cultures(KCTC, #52, Oun-dong, Yusong-gu, Taejon
305-333, Republic of Korea), an International depository
authority as accession No. KCTC 0595BP and KCTC 0596BP on
March 30, 1999. 
     
    
    [0028]
       E. coli  XL1-Blue transformed with either pGEX-SRPP or
pRSET-SRPP was grown to mid-stationary phase in LB
containing 50mg/L ampicillin at 30°C with vigorous aeration;
induced by adding IPTG to reach a concentration of 0.1mM;
and, incubated for another 4hrs. All subsequent steps were
carried out at 4°C. The cells were harvested, washed with
0.1M potassium phosphate(pH 7.4) by centrifugation (5000×g,
10min), and then disrupted by sonication. The cell 
homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10min and the
supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE according to
Laemmli's method( see : Laemmii, U.K., Nature, 277:680-685(1970)),
and the proteins were stained by Coomassie
Brilliant Blue R-250. Hereinafter, the supernatant
separated from the cell homogenates is referred to as "cell
extracts". 
     
    
    [0029]
     As a result, approximately 48kDa GST-SRPP fusion
protein from  E.coli  XL-1 Blue/pGEX-SRPP and approximately
24kDa recombinant SRPP from  E.coli  XL-1 Blue/pRSET-SRPP
were expressed, respectively. 
     Example 3 : Synthesis of rubber using recombinant SRPP 
   
    
    [0030]
     To investigate whether SRPP is related to rubber
synthesis,  in vitro  rubber synthesis was performed using
 Hevea  C-serum and washed rubber particle(WRP): WRPs were
first prepared by repeating centrifugation/floatation
procedure( see : Cornish, K. and Backhaus, R.A.,
Phytochemistry, 29:3809-3813(1990); Siler, D.J. and Cornish,
K., Phytochemistry, 32:1097-1102(1993)). The whole latex
from  H. brasiliensis  was mixed with equal volume of a
washing buffer solution(100mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing
5mM MgSO 4 , 10mM DTT and 0.1mM PMSF) and centrifuged at
40,000×g for 2hrs. The clear fluid was collected as a C-serum,
and the rubber particles at top layer were recovered
and washes several times with the same buffer to obtain WRP.
Then, rubber was synthesized  in vitro  by the conventional 
method in the art( see : Cornish, K. and Backhaus, R.A.,
Phytochemistry, 29:3809-3813(1990); Siler, D.J. and Cornish,
K., Phytochemistry, 32:1097-1102(1993)). 10mg of WRP and
cell extracts prepared from recombinant  E .  coli  XL-1
Blue/pGEX-SRPP expressing GST-SRPP fusion protein in
Example 2 were added in a reaction buffer(100mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, containing 80µM [ 14 C]-isopentenyl pyrophosphate(IPP,
55mCi mmol -1 ), 20µM farnesyl pyrophosphate(FPP), 1mM MgSO 4 ,
and 1mM dithiothreitol(DTT)) to reach a reaction volume of
50 µl, and incubated at 25 °C for 6hrs. As a control,
either the same cell extracts without IPTG induction or the
culture of  E .  coli  harboring pGEX expressing the GST
protein was used. The reaction was stopped by adding 25mM
of EDTA. 
     
    
    [0031]
     The resulting [ 14 C]IPP-incorporated rubber was
quantified by the aid of filtration or benzene extraction
method: For filtration method, the reaction mixture was
filtered through anodisc membrane having a pore size of
0.02 to 0.1µm(Whatman, U.S.A.), the filter was subjected to
repeated washing with 1M HCl and 95% ethanol( see : Cornish,
K. and Backhaus, R.A., Phytochemistry, 29:3809-3813(1990)),
and the remaining-radioactivity on the washed filters was
quantified by a liquid scintillation counter(Beckman,
U.S.A.). For benzene extraction method, the reaction
mixture was extracted three times with two volumes of
benzene, the benzene extract was mixed with a Ready Solv HP
scintillation cocktail (Beckman, U.S.A.) and the
radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation 
counter. The [ 14 C] IPP-incorporated rubber was increased
depending on the concentration of SRPP( see : Figure 5a). In
Figure 5a, (▪) represents cell extracts of recombinant  E .
 coli  expressing GST-SRPP; (◆) represents cell extracts of
recombinant  E .  coli  without IPTG induction; and, (▴)
represents cell extracts of recombinant  E .  coli  expressing
only the GST protein. 
     Example 4:  Inhibition of rubber synthesis by anti-SRPP
antibody 
   
    
    [0032]
     To further confirm that SRPP plays a critical role in
rubber synthesis, polyclonal antibody from SRPP-challenged
rabbit serum and monoclonal antibody from mouse were
prepared, respectively, and their ability to inhibit rubber
synthesis in C-serum was tested, while employing a control
of the untreated blood serum. The rubber synthesis was
carried out in an analogous manner as in Example 3 with the
exception of adding 5µl C-serum instead of  E .  coli  cell
extracts and supplementing with antibody or serum indicated
in Figure 5b. Figure 5b shows that the polyclonal
monoclonal antibodies generated against SRPP protein
inhibited rubber synthesis to a much greater extent than
the control serum. More severe reduction in rubber
synthesis was observed with polyclonal antibody than
monoclonal antibody. In Figure 5b, each value is the mean
of experiments for control rabbit(◆) and mouse() serum
without antibody formation, monoclonal antibody (▴) and 
polyclonal antibody (▪). This differential inhibitory
effect may be due to the immuno-cross reactivity of the
polyclonal antibody with REF, based on a high sequence
homology to SRPP. The results of Examples 3 and 4 suggest
that SRPP be involved in rubber synthesis. 
     
    
    [0033]
     As clearly illustrated and demonstrated as aboves, the
present invention provides cDNA encoding small rubber
particle-associated protein(SRPP) which binds to small
rubber particle derived from the latex of Hevea
 brasiliensis,  recombinant SRPP deduced from the cDNA,
recombinant expression vectors comprising the cDNA,
recombinant microorganisms transformed with the recombinant
expression vectors and method for synthesis of rubber using
the recombinant SRPP. The recombinant SRPP expressed in the
recombinant microorganisms can be applied for the rubber
synthesis in the presence of rubber particle.
