 Detailed Description 
 Thraustochytrids are single celled protists, which are currently classified as heterokonts or stramenopiles. The standard taxon hierarchy in relation to stramenopiles is in a 
 -Îperiod of flux, and is not settled but is subject to ongoing revision. Within the Stramenopiles, thraustochytrids belong to the Labyrinthulomycetes. The Thraustochytriidae form one of three main groupings within this taxon. However, due to the current uncertainties over the precise taxonomy of the Labyrinthulomycetes, it is 5 currently common to refer to protists having the defining features of both members of the Thraustochytrids and Aplanochytrids as âthraustochytridsâ. The terms âthraustochytridâ and âthraustochytridsâ are used throughout the present specification to include both Thraustochytrids and Aplanochytrids. 
 The present specification discloses a novel group of thraustochytrids, which has been given the proposed name of Caledochytrium aldermanii. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids have a number genotypic and phenotypic features which have not previously been observed in thraustochytrids or related species of microorganisms. 
 Initial observations showed the disclosed thraustochytrids to contain many cellular inclusions, including highly refractile vacuoles. These features are typically indicative of high levels of oil production, and subsequent analysis confirmed this. Indeed, the 20 disclosed thraustochytrids have been found to have properties which make them potentially useful in a number of biotechnological applications, in particular, as a source of carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA. 
 Deposited Strains 
 Examples of the disclosed thraustochytrids have been deposited under the Budapest Treaty prior to the filing date of the present application. 
 Each of the deposited strains is derived from a single thraustochytrid isolate that was obtained as long as 40 years ago. The disclosed thraustochytrids have been sub30 cultured approximately every 6 months throughout the intervening period (see Example 1 for details). 
 In the time that the disclosed thraustochytrids have been in culture it is estimated that they have undergone in excess of 30,000 generations (rounds of cell division). 
 -8Thraustochytrids, like other living organisms, experience mutations in their genome over time, but they have no form of sexual reproduction to remix the genetic changes, which, as a result, accumulate in the genome. Thraustochytrids are generally understood not to reproduce sexually and sexual stages have not been observed in the 5 disclosed thraustochytrids. Mutation is therefore essential for thraustochytrids to produce variability in these protists. 
 As a direct result of this extended period of isolated culturing conditions, in which mutations have accumulated, each of the deposited strains may differ to a greater or 10 lesser extent from the isolated strain from which it was originally derived.

 Characterisation of the disclosed thraustochytrids 
 The present disclosure is directed towards a novel group of thraustochytrids, which is exemplified by, but not limited to, the deposited thraustochytrid strains. 
 The disclosure includes thraustochytrid strains that are, or can be, derived from one of 15 the deposited strains, by any suitable method such as mutation, genetic modification, chemical mutagenesis, fermentative adaptation. 
 The disclosure also includes thraustochytrid strains that have genetic or morphological and functional features substantially the same as those of the deposited thraustochytrids. 
 The disclosed new group of thraustochytrids can be characterised and identified in a number of ways. The characterising features are listed here and discussed in more detail in the sections below. 
 Firstly, the disclosed thraustochytrids are thraustochytrids and therefore possess all of the features that are used and known in the art for the identification and characterisation of thraustochytrids. 
 Unlike any other known thraustochytrids, however, the disclosed thraustochytrids can be identified, and distinguished from other similar microorganisms, by means of utilising a novel method of cell division that has not previously been observed or reported in thraustochytrids. The method by which the cells of the disclosed thraustochytrids are observed to divide has not been observed in relation to other similar microorganisms, including other thraustochytrid strains. 
 - 10 The disclosed thraustochytrids can also be identified and distinguished by means of having an ITS2-28S ribosomal RNA sequence which differs from that of other thraustochytrids. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids also possess a unique profile of fatty acid production, including, in particular, a high percentage of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA. 
 Any of these forms of identification and characterisation, such as morphology, reproductive method, genotype, etc, can be used to characterise and identify the disclosed thraustochytrids. The deposited thraustochytrid strains are provided as examples for comparative purposes, in conjunction with the present disclosure, to assist the skilled person to identify the disclosed new group of thraustochytrids. 
 Thraustochytrids 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids have all of the features that are conventionally used in the art to uniquely characterise and classify microorganisms as thraustochytrids. 
 That the disclosed thraustochytrids have all of these characterising features can be determined using either or both light and electron microscopic techniques. Various suitable microscopic methods will be known to the skilled person and example methods are described in Examples 2 and 3. 
 Morphological features which are commonly used to characterise thraustochytrids, and which are observed in the disclosed thraustochytrids include: 
 Â· A sagenogenetosome (also known as a bothrosome). This is a sub-cellular organelle unique to the Labyrinthulomycetes, to which both thraustochytrids and aplanochytrids belong, which produces a characteristic âroot-likeâ, branching ectoplasmic net (see figures 12 and 13); 
 â¢ A non-cellulosic cell wall coated with circular scales (0.5-ÎÎ¼Î¹Î· in diameter, 2-3 30 nm thick) produced in the golgi apparatus (see figures 9,10, and 11); 
 â¢ A single stack of membranes in the golgi apparatus (see figure 9); 
 â¢ Mitochondria with tubular cristae (see figure 14); 
 â¢ Membranous paranuclear bodies (see figure 8); 
 â¢ Conspicuous centrioles (see figures 15-17); and, Â· Characteristic biflagellated zoospores (2-5pm). The longer of the two flagellae is covered in hair-like mastigonemes, while the shorter (Whiplash) flagellum is smooth. 
 - 11 Cell Division 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids can be identified by the fact that they are capable of reproducing by means of a novel mechanism that has never before been observed in 5 thraustochytrids. 
 In pollen culture, the disclosed thraustochytrids are most commonly observed to divide by binary fission to form diads, tetrads and clusters of vegetative cells (see figures 2a and 2b). Mature cells often become sporangia, undergoing internal division to form the io bi-flagellated, motile zoospores characteristic of thraustochytrids (see figures 3 and 4). 
 Alternatively, they release small immature cells which move slowly away on their ectoplasmic net in the manner of aplanospores (see figure 4). 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids are also unusual in that addition of low levels of B complex vitamins with Vitamin C to the seawater supplying the microscope chamber triggered the cytoplasm of a number of maturing cells rounding up to produce Umax amoebae (see figure 4), which are observed to emerge through the ruptured cell wall of the original (parent) cell and to subsequently glide away. This behaviour is not unique to the disclosed thraustochytrids, but is not regularly observed in thraustochytrids, and 20 may, therefore, be used in conjunction with some or all of the other described identifying features to assist the skilled person in identifying the disclosed thraustochytrids. 
 Electron micrographs of examples of the disclosed thraustochytrids are shown in figures 5a, 5b, 6, and 7, and these studies and others have revealed that the disclosed thraustochytrids utilise a method of cell division that no other thraustochytrids have been found to employ. 
 Specifically, in this novel method of cell division, the cytoplasm of the mother-cell vacuolates (see figure 6) until a large space is created, which, in older cells, can occupy the majority of the cell volume. Within this vacuole, small, new, secondary cells are created from mother cell cytoplasm, producing a cell or cells within a cell (see figure 7). The secondary (daughter) cells then grow within the mother cell until either the cell wall of the mother cell breaks, releasing the daughter cells, or until the daughter cells are expelled explosively. These rapidly expelled daughter cells are observed under light microscopy to apparently appear âfrom nowhereâ, however this method of cell division 
 - 12 cannot be observed using light microscopy because the daughter cells are screened by the mother cell cytoplasm. 
 This form of reproduction is known to occur in Paramixids, in which up to five or even six nested cells can be observed, and in Mixozoans, which commonly contain three generations within a single cell. However, this mode of reproduction has never previously been found to occur in thraustochytrids. This finding is significant because although this form of reproduction is known to be used in other groups of protozoa, such as the paramixids and mixozoa, these organisms are not closely related to the thraustochytrids, and no other thraustochytrid has been observed to use this form of reproduction. 
 The main component of cell membranes and also the ectoplasmic net of the thraustochytrids (which is essentially a tube made of unit membrane) are phospholipids. Thraustochytrids are exceptional in the amount of membranes they produce over the course of their lifetime, both within the cell body and the ectoplasmic net. One cell of around 10 pm diameter can be seen to produce 10s of net elements extending out from the cell for distances of more than 10 times the diameter of the cell (as shown in figure la) and these are constantly renewed. These membrane lipids add to the lipids stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, sometimes occupying more than half the cell (as shown in figure lb) to give the substantial amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids for which thraustochytrids are now known. In addition, uniquely in the disclosed thraustochytrids, because the tertiary, secondary and occasionally quaternary generations of cells within a mother cell have further extensive membranous structures (although not fully developed ectoplasmic net within the mother cell), this adds to the total lipid content that is available for extraction. Thus, it is believed that the unique mode of reproduction employed by the disclosed thraustochytrids is, at least in part, a contributing factor to the observed high levels of lipids produced by the disclosed thraustochytrids. 
 This mode of reproduction, which has not previously been found to occur in thraustochytrids, has been termed âbabushka dollâ reproduction. The ability to undergo cell division using this babushka doll method has been found to be characteristic of the disclosed thraustochytrids, and it can be used to identify and distinguish the thraustochytrids of the present disclosure from other known thraustochytrids. 
 -13The disclosed thraustochytrids are frequently observed to include cells in which the daughter cells themselves contain tertiary (i.e. granddaughter) cells (highlighted using a white arrow in figure 5a). Occasionally a fourth generation of cells can also be observed. 
 When the disclosed thraustochytrids are cultured in heterotrophic medium, such as MCBHB medium or Pandey and Bhathenaâs Broth, cells can be observed (for example, using electron microscopy) which include both daughter and granddaughter cells. In contrast, when other known thraustochytrids are treated in the same way and visualised by electron microscopy, cells have never been observed which include both daughter and granddaughter cells. It is important that cells comprising both daughter and granddaughter cells are considered because various artefacts may give rise to cells which appear to comprise a daughter cell only, such as, for example, zoospores. It must be noted, however, that the observation of internal granddaughter cells is merely a requirement for clarity of identification and in fact other thraustochytrids have not been observed to include internal granddaughter cells. 
 Thus, one method by which the disclosed thraustochytrids can be unambiguously distinguished from other thraustochytrids, is that the disclosed thraustochytrids, when 20 cultured in heterotrophic medium, such as MCBHB medium or Mumbai Broth, can be observed (for example, using electron microscopy) to comprise cells including an internal daughter cell, wherein that daughter cell also comprises an internal daughter cell (i.e. granddaughter cell) within it. The proportion of the disclosed thraustochytrids, when cultured in heterotrophic medium, which maybe observed (for example by electron microscopy) to include both daughter and granddaughter cells may be at least 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.1% of the total cell population (or in any given electron micrographic study or field of view comprising more than 10,000 cells, such as more than 5000 or more than 1000 cells). In some cases, at least 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, or 1% of the cells may be seen to include both daughter and granddaughter cells. 
 Due to this unique mode of reproduction, the disclosure includes a method for identifying a strain of thraustochytrid which is capable of producing high levels of fatty acids. The method comprises culturing the thraustochytrid strain in heterotrophic medium and determining whether the thraustochytrid culture comprises a cell having an internal daughter cell, wherein that daughter cell comprises a granddaughter cell within it. The presence of a cell comprising internal daughter and granddaughter cells 
 -14is indicative that the thraustochytrid strain is capable of producing high levels of fatty acids. 
 Sequence Identity 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids can be identified by means of having above a specific level of sequence identity to a defined ITS2-28S ribosome RNA genetic sequence. 
 SEQ ID NO. 1 is an approximately 600 base pair sequence encompassing a portion of the 3â end of the ITS2 sequence and a portion of the 5â end of the 28S ribosome RNA 10 genetic sequence of the disclosed thraustochytrids, specifically, of the strain CAi. For clarity, the region of genetic sequence encompassed by SEQ ID NO. 1 is referred to herein as an ITS2-28S ribosome RNA sequence. 
 This portion of the ribosome RNA genetic sequence to which the sequence of SEQ ID 
 NO. 1 corresponds is known to be highly variable, and has, therefore, been selected in order to provide the maximum degree of discrimination between thraustochytrid strains, allowing the skilled person to determine whether or not a given strain is a thraustochytrid strain of the present disclosure. Details of PCR primers and conditions that may be used to amplify the ITS2-28S ribosome RNA sequence are described below. 
 The skilled person will be able to use knowledge of the forward and reverse primer sequences to determine the exact region of genetic sequence that corresponds to SEQ ID NO. 1. 
 References in the present disclosure to the level of sequence identity that a given sequence has to SEQ ID NO. 1 are to be interpreted specifically as referring to the level of sequence identity between SEQ ID NO. 1 and the corresponding portion of the ITS228S ribosomal RNA sequence in question. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids may have at least 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 93%, 30 or 94% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:1. Specifically, the disclosed thraustochytrids may have at least 85%, 92%, or 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:i. 
 For example, the disclosed thraustochytrids may have at least 95.5, 96, 96.5, 97, 97.5, 98, 98.5, or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:1. The disclosed thraustochytrid may 35 have more than 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:1, such as at least 99.1, 99.2, 99.4, 
 99-5? 99-6, 99.8% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:1. 
 -Î¹ 5 In some embodiments, the disclosed thraustochytrids have a corresponding ITS2-28S ribosome RNA gene sequence which differs from the sequence set out in SEQ ID NO:1 in less than 30 positions (i.e. nucleotides, bases, etc), such as less than 25, 20,15,12, 
 10, 7, or 5, positions. 
 Suitable methods of extracting DNA from thraustochytrids and determining the ITS228S rRNA sequence will be known to the skilled person. An example of a suitable method is set out in Example 6. 
 For the purposes of the present specification, the terms âsequence identityâ, âsequence homologyâ, âsequence similarityâ, and similar terms, are to be interpreted as referring to the degree of similarity or relatedness between two nucleic acid sequences. Thus, for example, if the use of the word âhomologyâ is used between two non-natural sequences 15 it is understood that this is not necessarily indicating an evolutionary relationship between these two sequences, but rather is looking at the similarity or relatedness between their nucleic acid sequences. Many of the methods for determining homology between two evolutionarily related molecules are routinely applied to any two or more nucleic acids for the purpose of measuring sequence similarity regardless of whether 20 they are evolutionarily related or not. 
 The terms â% sequence identityâ, â% identicalâ, â% identityâ, â% homologyâ, â% similarityâ and similar terms, are to be understood to refer to the percentage of nucleotides that two or more sequences contain that are the same in corresponding 25 positions when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. A specified percentage of nucleotides can be referred to as having, for example, at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% sequence identity or homology over a specified region when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. Unless otherwise stated, the determination of % sequence identity/homology is based on a comparison of the 30 sequence in question with the entire sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, and not on a selected portion of SEQ ID NO. 1. Thus, in the case that a given sequence has only 50% of the length of SEQ ID NO. 1, the maximum possible percentage of sequence identity is 50%. 
 The skilled person will understand that various means for comparing sequences are 35 available. For example, one non-limiting example of a computer sequence alignment 
 -16program which may be used for determining the percent sequence identity/ homology between sequences is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). 
 Fatty Acids 
 Thraustochytrids are known to be able to produce compounds that are potentially valuable for use in biotechnology. In particular, thraustochytrids have been found to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). 
 PUFAs are classified based on the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid: omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids contain a first double bond at the third carbon, while omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids contain a first double bond at the sixth carbon. For example, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) with a chain length of 22 carbons and 6 double bonds, often designated as 22:6 n-3. Other omega-3 LC-PUFAs include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), designated as 20:5 n-3, and omega-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA n-3), designated as 22:5 n-3. DHA and EPA have been termed essential fatty acids. Omega-6 LC-PUFAs include arachidonic acid (ARA), designated as 20:4 n-6, and omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA n-6), designated as 22:5 n-6. Thraustochytrids are known to produce all of the above listed fatty acids. 
 Omega-3 fatty acids are biologically important molecules that have been found to affect cellular physiology due to their presence in cell membranes, regulate production and gene expression of biologically active compounds, and serve as biosynthetic substrates. 
 DHA accounts for approximately 15%-2O% of lipids in the human cerebral cortex, 30%60% of lipids in the retina. DHA also accounts for about 97% of the omega-3 fatty acids in the brain and up to 93% of the omega-3 fatty acids in the retina, and is an important component of breast milk. DHA is essential for both fetal and infant development as well as maintenance of cognitive functions in adults. 
 Omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, have also been found to possess antiinflammatory properties. Omega-3 fatty acids are not synthesized in the human (or mammalian) body, however, and must, therefore, be obtained from nutritional sources. 
 Fish oils, for example, are considered to be a good dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids. However, fish oils vary considerably in the type and level of fatty acid composition 
 -17depending on the particular fish species and their diets. For example, fish raised by aquaculture tend to have a lower level of omega-3 fatty acids than those in the wild. The supply of wild fish is becoming increasingly limited. Furthermore, fish oils carry the risk of containing environmental contaminants and can be associated with stability 5 problems and a fishy taste. Thus, there is a need for alternative, sustainable sources of omega-3 fatty acids. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids can clearly be seen using light or electron microscopy to comprise major lipid inclusions, as shown in figure lb. 
 Subsequent analysis of the lipids has shown that the disclosed thraustochytrids produce fatty acids, including omega-3 fatty acids, and in particular, DHA in significant quantities. In particular, the disclosed thraustochytrids have been found to produce significant quantities of fatty acids when cultured using heterotrophic medium, such as, 15 for example, MCBHB medium or Pandey and Bhathenaâs Broth. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids are capable of producing fatty acids, of which at least 30%, 35%, 40%, 43%, 48%, 53%, 57%, or even 60%, such as 45-75%, such as 50-70%, or 55-65% comprises omega-3 fatty acids. 
 In addition, the disclosed thraustochytrids are capable of producing fatty acids, of which at least 20%, 25%, 30%, 33%, 38%, 40%, 43%, 47%, 50%, 53%, 57% or even 60%, such as 35-70%, such as 45-67%, or 55-65% comprises DHA. 
 When the disclosed thraustochytrids are cultured in heterotrophic media such as MCBHB medium or Mumbai Broth, the concentrations of DHA in the culture medium maybe at least 1, 2, 3,4, 6, 8, 9,11,12,13,14, or 15 mgL- 1 , such as 5-20 mgLÂ· 1 , such as 718 mgL-Î¹, or 10-17 mgL-i. 
 Carotenoids 
 Oxygen is required for metabolic functions, but it also presents challenges to cells. This oxidative stress is believed to be a contributing factor in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic heart disease and stroke, Alzheimer's dementia, cancer and ageing. Therefore, compounds with antioxidant properties have the potential to protect against 35 a wide spectrum of diseases. 
 -18Several antioxidant compounds are known to be produced by thraustochytrids, and these include astaxanthin, beta-carotene and other carotenoids. The disclosed thraustochytrids have been found to produce carotenoids (see Example 2). Specifically, when grown in MCBHB medium the disclosed thraustochytrids have been found to produce carotenoids in a total amount of greater than 200, 300, or 400 pg/kg dry weight of sample, such as 50-1100,100-1000, or 150-900 pg/kg dry weight of sample. In particular, the disclosed thraustochytrids have been found to produce beta-carotene, astaxanthin, and/or canthaxanthin when grown in MCBHB medium. The amount of beta-carotene produced may be greater than 40,50, or 60 pg/kg dry weight of sample, such as 10-200, 20-150, or 30-120 pg/kg dry weight of sample. The amount of Astaxanthin produced may be greater than 200, 300, or 400 pg/kg dry weight of sample, such as 50-1000,100-900, or 150-850 pg/kg dry weight of sample. The amount of canthaxanthin produced maybe greater than 4, 5, or 6 pg/kg dry weight of sample, such as 1-30, 2-27, or 3-24 pg/kg dry weight of sample. 
 Carotenoids are important natural pigments which are usually red, orange or yellow in colour. Traditionally, carotenoids have been used in the feed, food and nutraceutical industries. They are known to be essential for plant growth and photosynthesis, and are a main dietary source of vitamin A in humans. Carotenoids are potent biological antioxidants that can absorb the excited energy of singlet oxygen onto the carotenoid chain, leading to the degradation of the carotenoid molecule but preventing other molecules or tissues from being damaged. 
 Carotenoids are a widely distributed group of naturally occurring pigments, with astaxanthin and its derivatives being of particular interest commercially. Astaxanthin is an extremely effective antioxidant protector. Yet, unlike beta-carotene, astaxanthin readily crosses the blood-brain/retina barrier, and therefore also has potential to protect from diseases of the brain and the eyes. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids may be used in the production of carotenoids including carotene (such as beta-carotene), the xanthophyll compounds astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and echinenone, lycopene, and others, including phoenicoxanthin, capsanthin, lutein, annatto, beta-apo-8-carotenal, and beta-apo-8-carotenal- ester. The carotenoids may be used in the treatment of any oxidative stress-related conditions, including those discussed above. 
 -19Squalene 
 Squalene is most commonly obtained from the livers of sharks as the concentration of the material is highest in those animals. Estimated demand for squalene is between 1,000-2,000 tons per annum. The livers of approximately 3,000 sharks are typically required to produce just 1 ton. Due to the excessive killing of sharks, growing environmental concerns and government regulation have created difficulties in getting raw material. 
 Squalene is also extracted from vegetable sources such as olive oil, sugarcanes, and 10 from other sources such as wheat germ oil, and rice bran oil. The vegetable sources have low concentration of squalene and large acreage sites are required to make the whole operation feasible. 
 Thraustochytrids are known to produce squalene, and the disclosed thraustochytrids 15 may be used as an eco-friendly alternative source of squalene. 
 Exopolysaccharides 
 Thraustochytrids are known to produce an extracellular composition comprising polysaccharides (up to about 53% of the composition), proteins, lipids, uronic acids, 20 and sulphates. These compositions are known as âexopolysaccharidesâ (EPS) and are produced around the thraustochytrid cells, particularly as the cells age. The major polysaccharide component of the EPS is glucose, with some galactose, mannose, and arabinose. 
 EPS are believed to protect the cells from desiccation and other environmental factors and to assist with adherence. Thraustochytrid-derived EPS has also been found to exhibit a broad spectrum of anti-viral activities. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrid has been found to produce large quantities of exopolysaccharide, as shown in figure 3c. 
 Enzymes for Oil Breakdown 
 Thraustochytrids are heterotrophic microorganisms and are, therefore, capable of utilising organic compounds in their environment including hydrocarbons for their 35 nutrition, and converting these to their cell biomass and to carbon dioxide through 
 - 20 respiration. Thraustochytrids have been found to be capable of degrading and removing organic pollutants. 
 Hydrocarbons are one of the major pollutants in the marine environment. Sources of this pollutant are crude oils, as well as products of their distillation, such as gasolines, heating fuels, diesels, and heavy fuel oils. Once introduced into the water, hydrocarbons undergo a rapid process of weathering and biodegradation, whereby the volatile aromatics and small molecular aliphatics are removed. More complex components of the hydrocarbons, in the form of tar balls, persist for a longer time and continue to induce toxic effects. Such tar balls consist of long chain aliphatics, complex polyaromatics and asphaltenes. 
 Thraustochytrids have been found to be capable of degrading and thereby removing hydrocarbon pollutants, including tar balls, in marine sediments. 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids may be used in a method of removal of hydrocarbon pollutants, including tar ball pollutants. For use in the disclosed method, thraustochytrids as disclosed can be grown in large quantities in any suitable nutrient medium. Thraustochytrids for use in the process can be obtained by culture in seawater/peptone broth containing autoclaved crude oil, but may be obtained by growing thraustochytrids in any standard nutrient broth containing seawater. Autoclaved crude oil has been found to support excellent growth of thraustochytrids. The thraustochytrids can be applied directly to the polluted sediments. No supplementary addition of nutrients is necessary; the thraustochytrids degrade the tar ball components. 
 For analytical purposes, tar balls may be dissolved in a small quantity of hexane and mixed with a marine sediment sample. After addition of thraustochytrids as disclosed to such a sediment, degradation of tar balls can be monitored periodically using gas chromatography. 
 Thus, the disclosed thraustochytrids may be used in a method for removal of hydrocarbon pollutants, including tar ball pollutants. For example, a method may comprise contacting hydrocarbon (such as tar ball)-polluted sediments with the disclosed thraustochytrid for an incubation period, and separating the thraustochytrids and sediments from the residual pollutants. The incubation period maybe a period 
 - 21 until the desired level of degradation of the pollutant (such as the tar ball) has been achieved, or it may be a fixed time period, such as for example, 5-200 days, such as, for example, 10-100 or 20-30 days. Extracting the sediment grown culture may comprise using hexane to remove the residual tar ball.

 Genetics 
 A new approach for the production of oils has been to transfer a set of genes involved in omega-3 and/or omega-6 synthesis into plants in order to produce high levels of PUFA in oilseed. Thus, the unique ability of thraustochytrids to produce high amounts of 25 DHA and other LC-PUFA has generated interest in metabolic engineering using thraustochytrid enzymes involved in PUFA synthesis. The first example of transfer of thraustochytrid genes into plants for the production of PUFA was patented by Kinney et al. (2004) using an elongase from Thraustochytrium aureum, among other genes. 
 The authors showed maximum level of 19.6% of EPA and 3.3% of DHA in genetically 30 modified Glycine max embryos and seeds. Similarly, Wu et al. (2005) engineered a 9gene construct, of which 4 genes came from Thraustochytrium sp. 26185, and showed a maximum level (wt%) of ARA, EPA and DHA (7.3%, 15% and 1.5%, respectively) in seeds of the transgenic Brassica j uncea breeding line 1424. The Rothamsted Institute in the UK carried out extensive work on EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana and Camelina sativa using delta-4 and/or delta-5 desaturases from Thraustochytrium sp., in combination with genes from other microorganisms (Ruiz 
 -30Lopez et al., 2014, 2013). However, the resulting seeds are genetically modified and as a result their use is presently restricted or banned in some countries. 
 Nevertheless, in some embodiments, the disclosure is directed to genes obtained or derived from the disclosed thraustochytrids. Such genes may include, in particular, genes involved in the synthesis of PUFAs, which may include any genes corresponding to the thraustochytrid-derived genes used in the studies discussed above. 
 In some embodiments, the disclosure is also directed to a recombinant thraustochytrid derived from an isolated thraustochytrid strain referred to herein as CAi, CA2, CA3, CA4, CA5, or CA8 (corresponding Accession Numbers as set out above), wherein the recombinant thraustochytrid expresses an exogenous gene, or has altered levels of expression or activity of an endogenous gene.

 Methods of Obtaining Products 
 Methods of obtaining the products disclosed above, including fatty acids, carotenoids, squalene, etc from the disclosed thraustochytrids comprise culturing a thraustochytrid as disclosed and isolating the desired product. 
 Various suitable procedures can be employed in the recovery of the cellular biomass from the culture media, such as by filtration or centrifugation, and these methods will be familiar to the skilled person. The cells and/or media can then be prepared for further use or for storage as appropriate. For example, the cells can be washed, frozen, lyophilized, or spray dried, as appropriate, using any suitable known method. 
 For the production of fatty acids specifically, thraustochytrids as disclosed may be grown in a heterotrophic culture medium (as described above). The supply of nitrogen 
 -33is limited after about 24 to about 48 hours, while the supply of carbon remains in abundance. The thraustochytrid continues to assimilate the carbon but the lack of nitrogen prevents protein and nucleic acid synthesis, causing the organisms to cease cell division. The result is that the sugars within the medium are converted to lipids by 5 the thraustochytrids. 
 Lipids, for example, containing DHA and other PUFAs, can be extracted from the cellular biomass produced from the disclosed thraustochytrids using methods known to the skilled person. These include supercritical fluid extraction, or extraction with solvents such as chloroform, hexane, methylene chloride, or methanol. The resulting extract can then be evaporated under negative pressure to produce a sample of concentrated lipid material. 
 The omega-3 PUFAs, for example, may be further concentrated by hydrolyzing the lipids and concentrating the highly unsaturated fraction by employing traditional methods such as urea adduction or fractional distillation, column chromatography, or by supercritical fluid fractionation. The cells can also be broken or lysed and the lipids extracted into vegetable or animal oils. The extracted oils can be refined by well-known processes routinely employed to refine vegetable oils (e.g. by chemical or physical refining). These refining processes remove impurities from extracted oils. After refining, the oils can be used directly, for example, as a feed or food additive to produce omega-3 enriched products. Alternatively, the oil can be further processed and purified and then used in the above applications and also in pharmaceutical applications. 
 Concentrated omega-3 may also be produced from the disclosed thraustochytrids by rupturing or permeabilising the harvested cellular biomass by well-known techniques such as sonication, liquid-shear disruption methods, bead milling, pressing under high pressure, freeze-thawing, or enzymatic digestion of the cell wall. The lipids from the ruptured cells may be extracted using a solvent or mixture of solvents such as hexane, chloroform, ether, or methanol. The solvent may be removed and the lipids hydrolyzed using any of the well-known methods. After hydrolysis, the nonsaponifiable compounds may be extracted into a solvent such as ether, hexane or chloroform and removed. The remaining solution may then be acidified by addition of an acid, and the free fatty acid extracted into a solvent such as hexane, ether or chloroform. The solvent solution containing the free fatty acids may then be cooled to a temperature low enough for crystallization of the non-PUFA compounds, which can then be removed via filtration, 
 -34centrifugation or settling. This results in a concentrated preparation of the remaining PUFA compounds which may be used, for example, as nutritional supplements for humans, as food additive, or in pharmaceutical applications.

 Examples 
 The invention will now be explained in further detail in the following Examples. 
 1._____Isolation and Culture of the Disclosed Thraustochytrids 
 The thraustochytrid strains referred to herein as CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, CA5, and CA8 20 (corresponding Accession Numbers as set out above) are part of a large collection of thraustochytrid strains which have been isolated and accumulated in the UK over the last 40 years. The thraustochytrid strains in the collection, including the deposited strains, have never been cryopreserved, but have been maintained in slow-growing, live, pure culture since their original isolation. 
 The isolates were grown at either 7Â°C, ioÂ°C, or 15Â°C in flasks containing 20ml of sterile seawater, with 80ml of air space above to provide an oxygen supply. After inoculating the seawater with three standard bacteriology loops of an actively growing culture, approximately o.25gms of pine pollen, which had previously been twice dry air heated 30 at 103-106 0  for 8 hours in an oven to sterilise it, was added. The pine pollen provides a rich supply of nutrients for the thraustochytrids which can penetrate the tough wall of the pollen grain using their ectoplasmic net. Pollen grains which are not colonised by the thraustochytrids retain their nutrient value for many months. Therefore, the cultures only require to be subbed every three to six months. 
 -39When required for further study, colonized pollen grains were plated on to agar produced using heterotrophic medium, such as, for example, MCBHB agar or Pandey and Bathenâa agar, and single colonies were isolated and transferred into heterotrophic medium, such as MCBHB or Pandey and Bathenaâs Broth in flask culture. 
 Each thraustochytrid isolate in the collection, including the deposited strains, was created by inoculating an original culture with one pollen grain, colonised by one thraustochytrid from a culture which had itself been inoculated with a single colony from an agar plate (0.03% peptone, 0.003% yeast extract (Difco Germany) 0.3% malt 10 extract (Biomaltz, Germany) 2% pre-soaked Fadenagar in seawater to make a moist agar, 0.2% bacteriological agar (Difco, Germany)). The agar plates had been inoculated with pollen grains, which came from seawater pollen flasks, which had previously been inoculated with small amounts of sample material from which thraustochytrids were observed to have grown. Each isolate was therefore originally an axenic culture of one thraustochytrid. 
 2. Light Microscopy and Carotenoid Production 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids were investigated using light microscopy. 
 Individual axenic cultures, grown on pollen, were examined in a specially adapted chamber for use with a high-powered Leitz or Zeiss microscope equipped with a camera and/or video capacity. The adapted chamber was arranged to provide slowly flowing, sterile sea water, which allowed individual cells to be viewed at a range of magnifications (up to tooox) and followed over a complete cycle(s) of growth and division over 2-4 days. 
 A mature cell, which is a typical example of the disclosed thraustochytrids, is shown in figure 1. Ectoplasmic net elements can be seen extending from the cell. The body at the edge of the image is a pine pollen grain. 
 In addition, when observed as colonies grown on agar plates, the disclosed thraustochytrids demonstrate variations in colour from translucent to white, cream, or pale yellow. Subsequent analysis has shown that the disclosed thraustochytrids produce significant quantities of carotenoids and the observed colours correlate with the levels of carotenoids produced by the disclosed thraustochytrids. 
 -40Analysis of the strains for the production of carotenoids was carried out by the commercial Nutrition Analytical Service (NAS) of the Institute of Aquaculture, the University of Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA. The Nutrition Analytical Service (NAS) were supplied with a wet pellet of the total cells from mature cultures, grown in MCBHB 5 medium. The cells were centrifuged gently (3000 rpm) and then re-suspended twice in filtered sterile seawater to remove the medium in which they had been grown. All samples were then freeze-dried, prior to carotenoid analysis. 
 The following methodology was then followed: 
 1) Accurate weights of the freeze-dried samples were obtained. 
 2) 5mls of acetone was added directly to the freeze-dried samples, mixed thoroughly and homogenised using a small ultra-turrax. 
 3) The sample tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatants transferred to a clean tube. 
 4) 5mls of dichloromethane was added to the pelleted materials from step 3. The tubes were mixed thoroughly, centrifuged at 4ooorpm for 5 minutes and the supernatants combined with that from step 3. 
 5) tml of DMSO was added to the pelleted materials from step 4) and the sample tubes were placed in a sonicating water bath for 10 minutes to ensure that the cells were fully disrupted for complete extraction of the carotenoids. 
 6) Following removal from the water bath, 1ml of 20% sodium sulphate anhydrous was added and the tubes mixed thoroughly. The sample volume was made up to 7ml with distilled water and mixed again before adding a further 5mls of dichloromethane followed by thorough mixing for 2 minutes in order to disperse the carotenoids into the lower DCM layer. 
 7) The sample tubes were centrifuged at 4ooorpm for 1 minute and the volume of the upper aqueous layer was reduced to the 7ml mark by aspiration. 
 8) Sufficient distilled water was added to the sample tubes to bring the volume back to the 12ml mark before mixing thoroughly, centrifuging at 4ooorpm for 1 minute and reducing the aqueous layer back to 7ml by aspiration. 
 9) Step 8 was repeated a further twice to give a total of 4 washes in order to completely remove the DMSO. 
 10) After the final wash, the entire aqueous layer was removed by aspiration and the remaining solvent layer, containing the carotenoids, combined with that from step 3. 
 11) The combined supernatants were then evaporated under oxygen free nitrogen to leave the carotenoid residues which were then re-suspended in known volumes of isohexane: acetone (82:18) ready for HPLC analysis 
 The following are the details of the HPLC methodology used: 
 Column: stainless steel, length 125 mm, diameter 4.0 mm, stationary phase ROC 5 Î¼ Silica. 
 Mobile phase: iso-hexane: acetone (82:18, v/v), flow rate 1.2 ml/min, at room temperature, maximum pressure 5000 psi. 
 Injection by: auto sampler, injection volume 50 Î¼Î. 
 Detection: absorbance at 47onm or 450nm, as detailed below. 
 The carotenoid concentrations were calculated against the appropriate standards, detailed below, which were injected externally to the samples. Where a specific carotenoid standard was unavailable (e.g adonirubin) the astaxanthin standard was used for calculation. 
 The following formula was applied: 
 Cone pg/g sample = (cone of standard (pg/ml) x sample area x volume) / (standard area x sample wt (g)) 
 Carotenoid standards: 
 The following carotenoid standards were used: 
 Astaxanthin (all E, >98% reference material) 
 Canthaxanthin (Sigma 11775 - 1 nig) 
 Xanthophyll (Lutein) (Sigma 95507 - 1 mg) 
 Beta carotene (Sigma C9750 - 25G) 
 Preparation of Astaxanthin Standard: 
 1) Approximately 2 mg of crystalline astaxanthin (all E, reference material >98%) were added to a 100ml volumetric flask. 
 2) lg butylhydroxytoluene and 25 ml chloroform were added to the flask and the contents sonicated in an ultrasonic water bath for 15 minutes. The flask was then made up to full volume with chloroform. 
 3) An aliquot of 10 ml of the resulting solution was transferred into a 100 ml volumetric flask and combined with approximately 85 ml of iso-hexane. 
 4) The solution was allowed to come to room temperature and the flask was then filled to volume with iso-hexane. 3.5 ml of this stock astaxanthin solution was transferred 7 ml glass vials, to which 3.5 ml of iso-hexane were then added. The resulting mixture was stored refrigerated until required. 
 5) The concentration of astaxanthin was calculated according to the following equation: 
 C = (absorption (at 470nm) x 10000) / 2100 
 Preparation of Canthaxanthin Standard: 
 The methodology above was repeated, except using canthaxanthin crystals. 
 The concentration of canthaxanthin is calculated according to the following equation: C = (absorption (at 470nm) x 10000) / 2200 
 Preparation of Lutein Standard: 
 1) 5 ml of chloroform and 1 g butylhydroxytoluene were added to a standard vial containing 1 mg of xanthophyll standard, and mixed well on the whirlimixer. The mixture was transferred to a 100 ml volumetric flask and made to the mark with isohexane. 
 2) Approximately 1 ml aliquots of this solution were measured into individual 7 ml 20 glass vials, to which 5ml of iso-hexane were then added. 
 3) The concentration of lutein was then calculated according to the following equation: 
 C = (absorption (at 450nm) x 10000) / 2450 
 Preparation of BetaCarotene Standard: 
 1) 5 ml of chloroform and lg butylhydroxytoluene were added to approximately lmg of beta carotene standard, and mixed well on the whirlimixer. The mixture was then transferred to a 100 ml volumetric flask and made to the mark with iso-hexane. 
 2) Approximately 1 ml aliquots of the mixture were then decanted into individual 7 30 ml glass vials to which 5ml of iso-hexane were also added. 
 3) The concentration of beta carotene is calculated according to the following equation: 
 C = (absorption (at 450nm) x 10000) / 2300

 These results show that all of the isolates tested (CA1-5) have the potential to produce carotenoids, particularly beta-carotene, astaxanthin, and canthaxanthin, when grown in MCBHB medium. 
 3,_____Transmission Electron Microscopy 
 The disclosed thraustochytrids were investigated using light microscopy. 
 One isolate, CA2 (corresponding Accession Number as set out above), was grown in a rich nutrient medium at 20Â°C for 3-4 days, with the aim of harvesting the cultures in 25 their most actively growing phase, when all life stages should be present. 
 Cells were prepared by the methodology recommended by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science Laboratory (CEFAS), Weymouth, UK. Briefly, the method used involved: 
 1. concentrating the cells by gentle centrifugation (i28g for 3 minutes); 
 2. washing the cells twice with phosphate buffered saline pH 7.0 (i37mM NaCl, 3mM KCl,iomM Na2HP04, 2mM KH2PO4) to remove any adhering medium; and 
 3. fixing the cells in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2M sodium cacodylate buffer. 
 Samples were stored at 4Â°C and sent to CEFAS for further processing. 
 -44The cells were subsequently washed twice in 0.2M sodium cacodylate buffer before being post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.2M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 hr. A final rinse in 0.2M sodium cacodylate buffer then preceded dehydration in a graded acetone series (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%) with each step taking 10 minutes. 
 The rinse in 100% acetone was performed three times to ensure complete dehydration before the sample went through a graded resin series over 2 hours to replace the acetone. The resin was then polymerised in an oven in a fume cupboard overnight. 
 The resulting resin blocks were trimmed and sectioned using a glass knife in an ultramicrotome, to produce both semi-thin (approximately lpm) and thin (7O-9Onm) sections. The semi-thin sections were stained with 1% aqueous toluidine blue with 1% carmine and 1% borax for 1 minute. The thin sections, taken from areas of interest, were stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution and then in Reynolds lead citrate solution (in a carbon dioxide free container), with two rinse steps in distilled water between each stain. 
 After drying, the sections were examined with a JOEL 1210 transmission electron microscope at the CEFAS Laboratory. 
 4. Morphological Analysis 
 No sexual reproduction has been observed in the disclosed thraustochytrids, as is also typical of thraustochytrids. 
 However, in heterotrophic culture medium, such as MCBHB culture medium, the disclosed thraustochytrids are capable of a mode of reproduction which has not previously been reported in a thraustochytrid. This form of reproduction is known in other groups of protozoa, such as the paramixids and mixozoa, however these groups of protozoa are not closely related to the thraustochytrids. 
 In order to observe this novel mechanism of cell division, the disclosed thraustochytrids may be cultured in heterotrophic culture medium, such as MCBHB medium, as described above, and then prepared in semi-thin sections and visualised by electron microscopy, as described above. 
 -45Examples of the resulting electron micrographs are shown in figures 5a, 5b, 6, 7. In any given field of view a proportion of the cells (generally in the region of 0.1-1% of the total number of cells visualised) were observed to include both daughter and granddaughter cells (as indicated, for example, with a white arrow in figure 5a). When other known thraustochytrid strains were cultured and visualised in the same way, no cells were observed to include both daughter and granddaughter cells. 
 5. Fatty Acid Composition 
 In order to investigate the production of fatty acids by the disclosed thraustochytrid microorganisms, colonised pollen grains were plated on agar produced from heterotrophic medium (in this case, MCBHB Agar) and single colonies were then transferred into heterotrophic medium (in this case, MCBHB medium) in flask culture. 50% natural seawater was used for both agar and medium, diluted with distilled water, rather than artificial sea salts made up in distilled water. 
 Each isolate to be tested was then innoculated at 3% v/v into conical flasks and incubated on a rotary shaker at 2iÂ°C, toorpm. At the end of the exponential phase of growth, one half of the flasks were processed further, while the remainder were incubated for a further four days, taking the cultures to late stationary phase. Cells 20 were centrifuged, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.2 and the resulting pellets were stored at -20Â°C and then freeze dried before fatty acid analysis. 
 For analysis of the fatty acids, samples were prepared and analysed in triplicate. Briefly, cell pellets were transesterified to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), using well 25 known methods. The resulting FAME were analysed using gas chromatography to determine the composition of fatty acids. Confirmation was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
 All of the samples of the disclosed thraustochytrids that were tested, including all of the 30 deposited strains, were found to produce high levels of fatty acids, including omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and in particular, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), relative to levels previously reported to be produced by thraustochytrids. 
 The mean amount of omega-3 fatty acids produced as a percentage of the total fatty 35 acid production by each strain was 61%. The highest amount of omega-3 fatty acids 
 -46produced as a percentage of the total fatty acid production was 71% (CA2 corresponding Accession Number as set out above). 
 The DHA fatty acid composition of the deposited strains was found to be between 37% (CA5 - corresponding Accession Number as set out above) and 65% (CA2 corresponding Accession Number as set out above) as a percentage of the total fatty acids produced. This level of DHA production is understood to be the highest level found to be produced by thraustochytrids. 
 Concentrations of DHA in the culture medium were observed to be in the range of 10i7mg L 1 ., with the highest levels observed to be produced by the strains CAi and CA3 (corresponding Accession Numbers as set out above). 
 6.____DNA Extraction and ITS2-28S Ribosomal RNA Gene Sequencing 
 For molecular characterisation of the strains, 2 ml of culture was harvested and genomic DNA extracted according to Mo and Rinkevich (Mar Biotechnol (NY). 2001 Mar; 3(2):100-2). 
 Multiple copies of ribosomal RNA gene units are present in clusters in the genome, and 20 each copy of the RNA gene unit comprises the following portions, in order: ETS; 18S; 
 ITSi; 5.8S; ITS2; and 28S. Genomic DNA was used as template for PCR amplification using conserved eukaryotic primers (see below). Specifically, the forward primer was specific for a sequence near the 3â end of the 18S gene, and the reverse primer was specific for a sequence near the 5â end of the 28S gene. 
 The PCR reaction was carried out as follows: 5 pl Dreamtaq buffer, 0.2 pl Dreamtaq DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher UK), 8 pl 1.25 mM dNTPs, 1 pl each primer at 10 pMol per microliter, 5 pl genomic DNA template were added to water to a final volume of 50 ul. The PCR programme consisted of a 3 minute denaturation at 94Â°C followed by 35 30 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 5OÂ°C annealing for 30 seconds and 72Â°C extension for 60 seconds, followed by a final extension at 72Â°C for 7 minutes. 
 The PCR reaction products were purified using a commercial kit from Qiagen before being sent for Sanger sequencing at Edinburgh Genomics (UK). The reverse primer was 35 used for sequencing. Five of the deposited strains were sequenced (the strains referred to as CAi, CA2, CA3, CA5, and CA8). The sequences obtained were approximately 600 
 -47base pairs each, starting from the 5â end of the 28S rRNA gene and extending into the ITS2 sequence. 
 The sequences obtained were as follows:

 The primers used were as follows: 
 UNUP18S42 (Forward): 5â-GGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAAC-3â (SEQ ID NO. 6); UNLO28S576B (Reverse): 5â-CTCCTTGGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACG-3â (SEQ ID NO. 7) 
 The sequences from strains CAi and CA2 were found to have 99% sequence identity. 
 The sequence from strain CA3 was found to have 93% sequence identity to the sequence from strain CAi. The sequence from strain CA5 was found to have 98% 
 -49sequence identity to the sequence from strain CAi. The sequence from strain CA8 was found to have 92% sequence identity to the sequence from strain CAi. 
 The sequence from strain CAi was compared with known rRNA genetic sequences in the NCBI databank using the BLAST alignment tool. In terms of thraustochytrid-like organisms, the CAi sequence was found to be 78% identical to a 425bp region of Japonochytrium 28S rRNA gene (Accession FJ030887), 76% identical to a 423bp region of Thraustochytrium aureum (FJ030888), and 70% identical to a 397bp region of Labyrinthula terrestris (KP996006). Homologous sequences were used to construct 10 a phylogenetic tree (shown in figure 18), in which two yeast 28S rRNA sequences (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used to root the tree (www.Phylogeny.fr: Dereeper A.,et al. (2008) âPhylogeny.fr: robust phylogenetic analysis for the non-specialistâ Nucleic Acids Res. 36 (Web Server issue): W465-9). 
 7. Exopolvsaccharide (EPS) production 
 The disclosed thraustochytrid has been observed by microscopy to produce large quantities of exopolysaccharide (see figure 3c). 
 For the production of EPS, the disclosed thraustochytrids are cultured in MCBHB or other suitable heterotrophic medium for a period of 2-10 days, or until significant quantities of EPS can be seen to have to accumulated, for example by light microscopy of individual cells. 
 The cell biomass is then separated from the culture medium by any suitable method, such as by means of centrifugation and filtration. If necessary, the level of EPS in the culture medium filtrate may be concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the skilled person will be aware of suitable methods. 
 The concentrated EPS may be precipitated by any suitable technique, for example, by 30 means of the addition of 70 % isopropyl alcohol, and freezing the culture filtrate to precipitate the EPS. 
 The precipitated EPS maybe further purified to obtain a specific pure fraction of the EPS. For example, a solution of the EPS may be separated using column chromatography.
