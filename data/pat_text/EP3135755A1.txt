 Background Art 
 
   
    
    [0002]
     Human growth occurs in a period up to adolescence, in which most growth plates are still open. Growth can be medically defined as a change in size accompanying maturation, and particularly, the term "growth of children" is intended to encompass not only an increase in height, but also increases in the size and function of each organ of the body. 
     
    
    [0003]
     It is generally recognized that human growth is most influenced by genetic factors. However, in fact, genetic factors have only about 23% of an influence on human growth, and the remaining 77% is determined by postnatal factors. In recent years, due to continued economic growth, westernized eating habits, improved nutritive conditions, etc., the growth and development of children and teenagers has greatly increased. In addition, with the emphasis of a social atmosphere where external appearances and heights are considered important, growth has been of increasing interest. 
     
    
    [0004]
     Methods for promoting growth, known to date, include methods of administering growth hormone agents. However, the use of growth hormones is very costly and may cause adverse effects, including various symptoms such as pruritus of injection sites, seizures, lipoatrophy, hypertension, glucose intolerance, pancreatitis, systemic allergic responses, growth hormone antibody-positive responses, cancer development, and gynaecomastia in males. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for the development of safe and effective food materials that can essentially assist in growth.

     Korean Patent No.    0887377    (entitled "Health supplement food for babies and teenagers"), Korean Patent No.    10530211    (entitled "Functional health food composition for improving learning ability and preparation method thereof"), Korean Patent No.    0561286    (entitled "Health functional composition for promotion of growth and development containing dried yeast, natural extract powder and mixed powder of nutritive components"), etc., suggest foods for promotion of growth. However, these foods have insufficient effects on growth promotion.

     Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in greater detail. 
     
    
    [0014]
     One aspect of the present invention is directed to a  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 Bifidobacterium, which has an excellent growth promoting effect and was internationally deposited with the Korean Collection for Type Culture (KCTC) of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology under accession number KCTC 12201BP. 
     
    
    [0015]
     The  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention can promote growth by digesting human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are not digested by human enzymes and are difficult to industrially produce in large amounts due to their very complex structure, and supplying human milk oligosaccharides to infants or young children who take this strain. 
     
    
    [0016]
     It is known that human milk contains 200 or more kinds of oligosaccharides having useful functions. It is known that human milk oligosaccharides promote the proliferation and propagation of beneficial intestinal microbial flora, inhibit the proliferation of harmful bacteria, function as regulator of cell responses, regulate the immune system, and contribute to the brain development of neonates and infants by supplying brain activity energy as a component essential for the brain growth and development of neonates and infants. 
     
    
    [0017]
     The human milk oligosaccharides have resistance to enzymatic digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and in the small intestines, and thus reach the colon without being damaged and function as a substrate for fermentation in the colon. It is thought that human milk contains several factors that promote the proliferation of beneficial intestinal microbial flora that inhibit the proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms. A process of enabling human milk oligosaccharides to increase the number of beneficial bacteria and reduce the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria occurs through competition for cell surface receptors, competition for essential nutrients, production of antibacterial agents, and production of inhibitory compounds such as single-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can lower the pH of excrement and inhibit potentially pathogenic bacteria. Human milk oligosaccharides are fermented to produce SCFAs such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid. It is thought that such SCFAs contribute to calories, function as a major energy source for the intestinal epithelium, stimulate the absorption of sodium and water in the colon, and enhance digestion and absorption in the small intestines. In addition, SCFAs contribute to general gastrointestinal health by regulating gastrointestinal development and immune functions. 
     
    
    [0018]
     Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are composed of various oligosaccharides, mainly five monosaccharides: D-glucose (Glc), D-galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), L-fucose (Fuc), and sialic acid (Sia; N-acetylneuraminic acid [Neu5Ac]). 
     
    
    [0019]
     The genome of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention includes various kinds of genes encoding enzymes that digest human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). The genome of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention includes genes that encode α-mannosidase, β-mannosidase, endo-β- N -acetylglucosaminidase, sialidase, and α-fucosidase. 
     
    
    [0020]
     The  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention includes genes that encode deacetylase, glucoside hydrolase,  family  1, β-glucosidase, β-1,3-exoglucanase, thermostable β-glucosidase B, D-allulose-6-phosphate 3-epimerase, sialidase A, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine diphosphorylase, 1,6-α-glucosidase, nucleoside-diphosphate-sugar epimerase, and amylo-α-1,6-glucosidase. 
     
    
    [0021]
     In addition, the genome of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention has genes that synthesize vitamins, particularly vitamins of group B. In the genome of the  Bi fidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention, genes capable of synthesizing two kinds of vitamins exist. Folate (B9) can be synthesized from chorismate, and nicotinic acid (B3) can be synthesized from L-aspartate. 
     
    
    [0022]
     As shown in  Fig. 7 , the  Bi fidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention has a gene for biosynthesis of bacteriocin. 
     
    
    [0023]
     According to another aspect of the present invention, the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention may be used as probiotic Bifidobacteria or may be used in various milk products and other fermentation products. 
     
    
    [0024]
     Still another aspect of the present invention is directed to a nutraceutical composition for promotion of growth, which contains the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention. Currently, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) cannot be produced in large amounts or are not commercially available, and thus are not contained in most formula milk or formula food products. Although human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are essential nutrient sources for infants, these oligosaccharides are not digested by human enzymes, and are excreted as feces if these are not digested. The nutraceutical composition for promotion of growth according to the present invention can promote the brain development and growth of neonates and infants by digesting and supplying human milk oligosaccharides. The food composition is a food, a nutraceutical, a supplement, a probiotic or a symbiotic. The term "probiotic" used herein refers to live microorganisms that are beneficial for the health of the host organism when they supplied in suitable amounts. The term "symbiotic" used herein refers to foods containing a mixture of prebiotic and probiotic.

    [0035]
     Hereinafter, the present invention will be described with reference to examples. It is to be understood, however, that these examples are only for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. 
   
 
 Examples 
 
 
 
 
 Example 1: Isolation and Identification of  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 Strain 
 
 
 
 
 1-1: Selection of Strain 
 
 
   
    
    [0036]
     1 g of human feces was serially diluted in sterile anaerobic water, and 1 ml of each of the dilutions was poured on Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS. BD. USA) solid medium and cultured for 3 days under anaerobic conditions. The produced colonies were transferred to a lactic acid bacteria selective medium (BL solid medium) obtained by adding BCP (Bromocresol purple, 0.17 g/L) to MRS, and then cultured for 3 days under the same conditions. The BCP indicator changes from purple to yellow when lactic acid bacteria form lactic acid to lower the surrounding pH. Colonies, the color around which changed to yellow, were selected, and then biochemical and molecular biological identification of the selected colonies was performed. Thereafter, one strain having the best functionality and stability was selected. 
   
 
 1-2: Identification of Selected Strain 
 
 
 
 
 1) Biochemical Identification Using API Kilt 
 
 
   
    
    [0037]
     In order to examine the sugar utilization of the selected strain, API 50 CHL Carbohydrate Test Kit (bioMerieux Co., France) was used. The strain was cultured in 10 ml of MRS (Man-Rogosa-Sharpe) liquid medium at 37°C for 17 hours, and then 1 ml of the culture was recovered and washed twice with CHL solution. Next, the cells were collected by centrifugation (MICRO-17, Hanil, Korea) and resuspended in 9 ml of CHL solution. 150 µl of the strain suspension was placed in each well of the API 50 CHL kit, and then autoclaved paraffin oil was dispensed onto the strain suspension in each well. After culture at 37°C for 3 days, the utilization of each sugar was analyzed. Whether the strain would utilize each of 49 carbon sources was determined by observing whether the color was changed by microbial proliferation. The results of identification were analyzed using the program API web for identification, and the results of the analysis are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below:

 2) Identification by 16s rDNA Gene Sequencing 
 
 
   
    
    [0038]
     Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolated strain and subjected to 16s rRNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from 1 ml of the pure culture of the strain (isolated from feces) by use of an Accuprep genomic extraction kit (Bioneer, Korea). Using the extracted DNA as a template, the 16s rRNA region was amplified by PCR (MyCycler, BIO-RAD, USA) using primer F (5'-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3') 3  and primer R (5'- AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3') 3 . 
     
    
    [0039]
     The PCR product was ligated to a pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, USA) and transformed into an  E. coli  DH5α strain, after which it was plated on an LB/x-gal/amp plate and cultured overnight at 37°C. A recombinant plasmid containing the insert was isolated from the transformant by screening, followed by DNA sequencing. In the DNA sequencing, the homology of the isolated strain to  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700) was analyzed using the Cluster V method of DNA star program. As shown in  Fig. 1 , the 16s rRNA sequence of the isolated strain showed a homology of 99.3% to  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700). 
   
 
 3) DNA Fingerprint Analysis by RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) 
 
 
   
    
    [0040]
     For RAPD analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from the strain isolated from feces. Using the isolated DNA as a template, PCR-RAPD (MyCycler, BIO-RAD, USA) was performed using a (GTG)s (5'-GTGGTGGTGGTGGTG-3') primer. The resulting PCR product was stained with EtBr (ethidium bromide), and then observed with G:BOX (SYNGENE, UK). As can be seen in  Fig. 2 , the result of RAPD indicated that the isolated strain showed a band pattern different from that of  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700). Accordingly, from the above result, it was found that the strain isolated from feces is a strain different from  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700). In  Fig. 2 ,  lane  1 indicates the result for  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700), and  lane  2 indicates the result for the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain (KCTC 12201BP). 
   
 
 4) DNA Fingerprint Analysis by PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis) 
 
 
   
    
    [0041]
     The O.D. of each of  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 and  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700), purely cultured in MRS broth, was measured, and then each strain was adjusted to a final O.D. of O.D 600 =4 using 2% low melting agarose, thereby constructing plugs. The constructed plug was placed in 1 ml of lysozyme buffer (2 mg/ml Lysozyme (Sigma), 0.05% N-lauorylsarcosine (Sigma)), and 10 µl of 4 mg/ml lysostaphin (Sigma) was added thereto, followed by incubation overnight at 37°C. The plug was carefully taken out and was added to 4 ml of NDS buffer (1 ml 1M Tris-HCl (pH=8.0), 10  ml  100% SDS, 89 ml 0.5M EDTA (pH=8.5)), followed by incubation overnight at 50°C. Next, the plug was washed six times with 10 ml of 50 mM EDTA (pH 8.5) with mild shaking, and then was carefully transferred to 400 µl of an enzyme buffer to be treated, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes. The plug was transferred to 400 µl of fresh enzyme buffer and a restriction enzyme (20 U) was added thereto, followed by incubation overnight at 37°C. As the restriction enzyme, NotI was used. Electrophoresis was performed using a CHEF system (BIO-RAD, USA) in 0.5X TBE at 5.3 cm/V and a pulse time of 1s to 15s for 20 hours. 
     
    
    [0042]
     After completion of electrophoresis, each plug was stained with EtBr solution, and the band pattern thereof was observed with G:BOX (SYNGENE, UK). The results of the PFGE performed using NotI indicated that the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain isolated from feces was a novel strain showing a band pattern different from that of  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700). In  Fig. 3 ,  lane  1 indicates the result for  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700), and  lane  2 indicates the result for the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain (KCTC 12201BP).

    [0044]
     Based on the above-described results, the isolated strain was named  "Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3" strain, deposited with the Korean Collection for Type Culture (KCTC), which is an international depository authority, on May 7, 2012, and assigned accession number KCTC 12201BP. 
   
 
 1-3: Functionality and Stability 
 
 
 
 
 1) Antibiotic Resistance Test 
 
 
   
    
    [0045]
     In order to verify the safety of the isolated  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain (KCTC 12201BP), the antibiotic resistance of the isolated strain was analyzed. The antibiotic resistance test was performed using the micro-dilution method recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and 10 kinds of antibiotics, including ampicillin (AMP), vancomycin (VAN), gentamicin (GEN), kanamycin (KAN), streptomycin (STM), erythromycin (ERM), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), clindamycin (CLM), tetracycline (TET) and chloramphenicol (CP), were used in the test. 
     
    
    [0046]
     For the antibiotics excluding clindamycin, each antibiotic was added to a mixture of 10% ISO-sensitest broth and 90% MRS broth at concentrations of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 µg/ml. Clindamycin was added at concentrations of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625 and 0.03125 µg/ml because the EFSA break point value of the lactobacillus group is 0.25 µg/ml or less. In addition, the test for quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) was performed using an E-test strip (BioMeriux). 
     
    
    [0047]
     Microplates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours under anaerobic conditions, and then MIC was measured as the minimum antibiotic concentration at which no visible growth was observed. 
     
    
    [0048]
     Whether  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 would have resistance to each antibiotic was analyzed, and the results of the analysis are shown in Table 4 below:
   Table 4       Strain   Antibiotic (µg/ml)       AMP   VAN   GEN   KAN   STM   ERM   CLM   QU+DA   TET   CP           Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3   <0.5   <0.5   <8   <64   <32   <0.5   <0.06   <0.38   <4   <2         EFSA break point     2   2   64   nr   128   0.5   0.25   1   8   4           
     
    
    [0049]
     It was shown that the resistances of the isolated  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain to all the antibiotics used in the test were lower than the EFSA antibiotic resistance standards, indicating that the isolated strain satisfies the stability standards for EFSA antibiotics. Since it was reported that Bifidobacteria have resistance to aminoglycosides such as kanamycin due to the absence of a cytochrome-mediated drug transport system, EFSA does not require the MIC value of the drug for Bifidobacteria. 
   
 
 2) Test for Intestinal Colonization 
 
 
   
    
    [0050]
     The measurement of intestinal colonization of  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 was performed in the HT-29 cell line derived from human colon epithelial cells while  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700) was used as a control. The HT-29 cell line was treated with each of the strains for 1 hour, and gram staining and viable cell counting were performed to compare the intestinal colonization ability between the strains. The results of the measurement are shown in Table 5 below:
   Table 5             Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3     Bifidobacterium breve   T           Intestinal colonization rate (%)   91.25   77.24           
     
    
    [0051]
     The results of measurement of the intestinal colonization indicated that the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain showed excellent intestinal colonization ability compared to the  Bifidobacterium breve   T  (ATCC 15700) strain. These results suggest that the strain of the present invention can adhere to intestinal epithelial cells to improve the intestinal environment. 
   
 
 3) Hemolysis Test 
 
 
   
    
    [0052]
     A hemolysis test was performed in order to confirm that Bifidobacteria had no hemolytic toxicity in the human body, and in the present invention, whether erythrocytes would be destroyed or degraded (hemolysis) was examined. According to the method of Baumgartner et al., the test strain was grown in 5% horse blood-supplemented MRS medium and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37°C for 48 hours. Whether the strain was hemolytic was determined based on whether a transparent ring was produced around the cells.  Fig. 4  shows the results of examining whether the strain of the present invention is hemolytic. As can be seen in  Fig. 4 , the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain was not hemolytic for horse blood, indicating that the strain was harmless to the human body. 
   
 
 4) Acute Toxicity Test 
 
 
   
    
    [0053]
     In order to verify the safety of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention, an acute toxicity test was performed on test animals. The lyophilized strain of the present invention was administered orally to 6-week-old male and female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in an amount of 1.0 × 10 11  cfu/kg. For a control group, 0.85% saline was administered intragastrically. Clinical symptoms in all the test animals were observed once a day for 14 days (a period ranging from 1 day after sample administration to the day of autopsy). The results of the observations are shown in Table 5 below. 
     
    
    [0054]
     After administration of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain, no death could not be observed in all the control group and the administered group, and an animal showing specific clinical symptoms could not be found. In addition, the intake of feed and water and the body temperature were observed for 14 days after administration, and, as a result, a statistically significant difference between the administered group and the control group could not be found.

 Example 2: Analysis of Genes of  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 Strain 
 
 
   
    
    [0055]
     Genome sequencing of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain (KCTC 12201BP) was performed using a PacBio RS II System (DNA Link, Republic of Korea). For the genome of the strain, a 10-kb library was constructed, and genome sequencing was performed using one of SMRT cells with C2-P4 chemistry. By the genome sequencing, a sequence having a length of 337,655,282 bp was obtained.  De novo  assembly was performed using SMRTpipe HGAP, and scaffolding and gap filling were performed using SMRTpipe AHA. Prediction of structural genes was performed using Glimmer3, and gene annotation was performed by AutoFACT (Koski et al. 2005) using the results obtained by BLASTP for Pfam, Uniref100, KEGG, COG and GenBank NR databases. Transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA were performed using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy 1997) and RNAmmer (Lagesen et al. 2007), respectively. The functional classification of genes by Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) category was performed using RPS-BLAST at an e-value cutoff of less than 1e-2 (Mavromatis et al. 2009). 
     
    
    [0056]
     The presence of specific genes on the genome was determined using BLASTP with a parameter of sequence homology ≥ 50% for a collected data set. Metabolic pathway analysis of the genome was performed using a KEGG automatic annotation server (Moriya et al. 2007). Analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes was performed using antiSMASH version 3.0.0 (Blin et al. 2013; Blin et al. 2014) ( http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/ ). 
   
 
 2-1: HOMO (Human Milk Oligosaccharide) Metabolism-Related Genes 
 
 
   
    
    [0057]
     The gene contents of the genome of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain according to the present invention were analyzed. As a result, it was found that the genome of the strain contains genes that encoded α-mannosidase, β-mannosidase, endo-β- N -acetylglucosaminidase, sialidase, and α-fucosidase, among human milk oligosaccharide metabolism-related genes. This suggests that the strain of the present invention can digest and supply human milk oligosaccharides that are not digested by human enzymes.

 2-2: Vitamin Biosynthetic Genes 
 
 
   
    
    [0058]
     The results of the gene analysis indicated that the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention had all genes for biosynthesis of vitamins, particularly vitamins of group B. In the genome of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention, genes capable of synthesizing two kinds of vitamins existed. It was found that the genome of the strain had genes that synthesized folate (B9) from chorismate and synthesized nicotinate (B3) from L-aspartate.

 2-3: Absence of Pathogenic Gene 
 
 
   
    
    [0060]
     Analysis of PAIs (pathogenicity islands) and REIs (antimicrobial resistance islands) was performed using the PAI finder of the PAI database (Yoon et al. 2007; Yoon et al. 2015). The results of the analysis indicated that PAI (pathogenicity islands) and a PAI-like region were not present in the genome of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention. 
   
 
 Example 3: Growth Promoting Effect of  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 Strain 
 
 
   
    
    [0061]
     The following example demonstrates the characteristics and growth promoting effect of the strain of the present invention. All the experimental results obtained in the Example were expressed as mean ± SD, and statistical processing of the experimental results was performed using GraphPad Prism™ 6.0. In addition, the significance of difference in means between the test groups was determined by one-way ANOVA, and then the Post Hoc test was performed using Tukey's multiple range test. 
   
 
 3-1: Preparation of Culture of Strain of the Present Invention and Composition Containing the Same 
 
 
   
    
    [0062]
     The  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain (KCTC 12201BP) was cultured in BL broth (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) at 37°C for 24 hours, and diluted to 10 11  CFU/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 130 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4). The dilution was sonicated and centrifuged to separate the supernatant, followed by filtration through a filter having a pore size of 0.45 µm. The filtrate was freeze-dried, and then stored at -20°C until use in  in vivo  experiments. 
   
 
 3-2: Obesity Animal Model and Sampling 
 
 
   
    
    [0063]
     Animal tests were carried out in accordance with the Animal use and Care Protocol of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). As test animals, 6-week-old SD rats (10 rats per group, consisting of five male rats and five female rats) were purchased from Saeron Bio Inc. (Uiwang, Korea) and acclimated for 24 hours. Then, the rats were raised for 17 days at a temperature of 24±2°C and a humidity of 55±15% with a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle. For elemental diets, the rats were allowed to take barley feed (A04, UAR, Vilemoisson-sur-Orge, France) for 17 days, and were also allowed to take drinking water alone or drinking water containing  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 (10 7  CFU/head/day) freely. 
   
 
 3-3: Growth Promoting Effect of Strain of the Present Invention 
 
 
   
    
    [0064]
     In order to observe the growth promoting effect of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention, the rats were fed with barley feed for 17 days to induce elemental diets, and the body weight and the intake of drinking water and feed were measured each day until  day  17 after the start of the experiment. The gain in the body weight was calculated by subtracting the body weight on the day of start of the experiment from the body weight on the day of measurement. The intake of each of drinking water and feed was calculated as the total intake until  day  17 by measuring the intake for each cage and then calculating the intake for each rat. The efficiency of the gain in the body weight was calculated by dividing the gain in the body weight by the total intake of feed. 
     
    
    [0065]
     It was observed that, in the case of the group (CBT BR3) fed with drinking water containing  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3, the body weight significantly increased from  day  12 compared to that of the group (NC) normally fed with general drinking water (12 days; p<0.05, 13 to 17 days; p<0.01) ( Fig. 7(A) ). However, the total intake of feed (FI) for 17 days and the total intake of drinking water (WI) for 17 days showed no significant difference between the two groups ( Fig. 7(B) ). It can be seen that administration of the strain of the present invention did not influence the feed intake and that the weight gain (WG) was not attributable to the difference in the feed intake (FI). The ratio of weight gain to weight gain (WG/FI) was more significant in the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3-fed group than in the normal group, indicating that the growth of the rats was promoted by administration of the  Bifidobacterium breve  CBT BR3 strain of the present invention.
