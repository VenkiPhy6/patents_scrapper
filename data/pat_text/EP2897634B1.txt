 BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE DISCLOSURE 
 
 
   
    
    [0002]
     Hemophilia A is a congenital or acquired disorder of coagulation that usually involves quantitative or functional disorder of a single coagulation protein. The available treatment for hemophilia A is the administration of plasma derived factor VIII or the infusion of recombinant factor VIII. 
     
    
    [0003]
     Factor VIII (FVIII) has 26 exons, encoding a polypeptide chain of 2351 amino acids (19 amino acids signal peptide and 2332 amino acids mature protein). It is a large multimeric protein with heavy (A1-A2-B domains) and light chains (A3-C1-C2 domains). The domain structure of factor VIII is arranged in order as (NH2)-A1-a1-A2-a2-B-a3-A3-C1-C2-(COOH) (a1, a2 and a3 indicate the spacers containing clusters of acidic amino acids). The molecular weight of heavy chain spans between 90 and 210 kDa due to the limited processing of several proteolytic sites in B domain. The molecular weight of light chain is 80 kDa as this is not processed (Kaufman et al, 1988, Bovenschen et al, 2005). Heavy and light chains remain associated with each other with the non-covalent linkage of metal ion. (Vehar et al, 1984, Fass et al, 1982, Fay et al, 1986, Fay et al, 1992). 
     
    
    [0004]
     The expression level of factor VIII in heterologous systems is lower than that of other similar proteins expressed (Kaufman, et al. 1997). The reasons behind the limited expression of factor VIII in heterologous systems are: inefficient expression of factor VIII mRNA, ineffective transport of translated product from endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, interaction of misfolded proteins with chaperons in the ER etc. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Marquette et al identified a 110 amino acid region within the A1 domain of factor VIII which inhibited factor VIII secretion from the ER (Marquette, et al. 1995). Further to this, the structural analysis revealed the presence of a hydrophobic β-sheet within this region (Swaroop, et al. 1997). Measures were taken to reduce the interaction of factor VIII with immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) by mutating the potential amino acids to hydrophilic amino acids (Swaroop, et al. 1997). 
     
    
    [0006]
     In the prior art, different mutations (single, double and triple) are reported pertaining to improve a single feature/trait. The mutations generated are aimed to improve the stability of the recombinant Factor VIII molecule by single [single mutations at the sites 519, 665 (A2 domain), and 1984 (A3 domain)], double [eleven double mutations in different combinations at the sites of 519, 665, and 1984] and triple [three triple mutations at the sites of 519, 665, and 1984 sites]. Further, the prior art also deals with the mutations aiming to improve the secretion of recombinant Factor VIII and concerned only about the amino acids in the A1 domain which interact with the proteins in the ER secretory pathway. The mutations generated are single [nine single mutations at the positions 293, 294, 300, 309, 310, 306, and 299 (present in the 110 amino acid stretch in A1 domain which interacts with chaperons)], double [five double mutations with different combinations of double mutations at the positions 293, 294, 300, 309, 310, 306, and 299], and triple mutations. 
     
    
    [0007]
         US20120190623    discloses a truncated B-domain FVIII carrying the mutation F309S. 
     
    
    [0008]
         US2012065136    discloses a mutant FVIII with multiple mutations e.g. D519V. 
     
    
    [0009]
     The point 'synergism' is applicable only if the mutations considered are pertaining to a single character. The activity of the recombinant Factor VIII is ultimately decided by the amount of protein successfully secreted with significant stability. The prior art so far has not reported any studies which tried to combine the two features- secretion and stability. Thus, the present disclosure aims at overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art by disclosing double mutant showing improved activity due to the combined features of increased stability and secretion.

     In an embodiment of the present invention, the double mutant recombinant Factor VIII of the present disclosure results in higher secretion, stability and activity. I. The double mutant F309S + D519V show an increased activity when compared to the wild type, single mutant F309S and D519V. The increased activity of the double mutant is explained by the synergistic effect of this combination (F309S + D519V) over the individual mutations F309S and D519V, wherein the functional roles of amino acids at these positions improve the secretion, stability and activity. 
     
    
    [0071]
     In an embodiment of the present disclosure, addition of Calcium ion in the formulation/composition comprising double mutant recombinant factor VIII increases the unit activity of double mutant recombinant Factor VIII (ΔBDD-FVIII). The increased activity observed with Ca 2+  is due to the effect of this specific combination of F309S and D519V mutations together in a single construct. Serine at 309 position is important in metal ion interaction over phenylalanine when the next position is occupied by Cysteine (Cys310). A mutation at 519 changes the conformational positioning of A1 and A3 and makes more amenable to Factor IXa binding through metal ion interaction. So putting this together, the double mutant of the present disclosure shows more stability compared to wild type BDD-FVIII. Further, reconstitution buffer combinations with calcium increases the activity of this double mutant. 
     
    
    [0072]
     Addition of divalent metal ions to the recombinant preparations used for therapeutic purposes is not a common practice. The structural elucidation of Factor VIII molecule, its interaction between different domains reveal that metal ions play a vital role in maintaining its functional integrity. It is shown that when heavy chain and light chain of Factor VIII reconstitutes in the presence of divalent metal ions they regain coagulation activity.

    [0103]
     One day before transfection, CHO cells are seeded onto 6 well plates. Each well has 0.5-2×10 5  cells in 500µl growth medium without antibiotics. Prior to transfection, the complexes are prepared separately. 4µg of DNA is diluted in 50µl of optimum medium (media without FBS). The mixture is gently mixed. 10µl of lipofectamine 2000 is diluted in 50µl optimum medium and is incubated for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes incubation, diluted DNA and diluted Lipofectamine 2000 are combined (total volume 100µl). It is mixed gently and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Medium is aspirated from plates and fresh medium is added without FBS and antibiotics before adding the complexes. 100µl of complexes are added to each well containing cells and medium. It is mixed gently so that the complex is distributed evenly and incubated at 37°C in CO 2  incubator. Complete medium is added after 6 hours of transfection. The cells are allowed to grow for 24 hours. Expression level is determined using GFP protein as control. 
     Selection of Stable Clones Expressing mutated recombinant FVIII Protein  (ΔBDD-FVIII)  in CHO Cell Line:

 Procedure 
 
   
    
    [0105]
     After transfection, cells are allowed to grow under non-selective conditions for 24 hours. After 24 hours, selection media is added with 560µg/ml of Geniticin. The cells are allowed to grow in selection media for 72 hours, after which fresh selection media is added. The clones are allowed to grow till it reached 90-100% confluency. Once the clones reached sufficient confluency, it is transferred to 96 well plate with same selection media. Clones are allowed to attach to surface and grow for 15 days or more. Passaging is done to 24 well plates, 12 well plates and 6 well plates with selection media. 
   
 Selection of Single Clones Producing FVIII: 
 
   
    
    [0106]
     Once the stable clones are produced, single clones are selected from stable clones. Clones are selected from 12 well plates. The cells are trypsinized and stable clones are diluted in 10 ml selection media. Dilution is made after cell counting. 100µl of selection media statistically yields between 5-10 clones per 96 well plate, thereby minimizing the probability of wells with more than one clone. Cells are incubated under standard conditions and cells are feeded after 10-14 days with fresh selection medium. Clones are analyzed or further expanded as soon as cells in the non-transfected control wells have completely died. Once the resistant clones are identified, the cells are expanded and assayed for protein of interest by using appropriate analysis method. 
     Culturing of Single Clones Expressing Mutated Factor VIII  (ΔBDD-FVIII)  in Serum Free Media:   
   
    
    [0107]
     CHO cell line is first cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Concentration of serum is decreased stepwise in every other passage. Cells are finally maintained in lower concentrations of FBS, up to 0.5%. Selected mutated single clones are cultured in DMEM-F12 supplied with 0.5% of FBS and after two passages they are transferred to serum free media. 3×10 5  cells/ml are transferred to serum free media and allowed to grow at 37°C with 5% CO 2  supply. Cell culture supernatant is collected at various time points to check the protein production. Time points selected are 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Cell culture supernatant is then subjected to ELISA and Western blot for further analysis of secreted protein. 
     Selection Of Stable Clones Expressing Mutated BDD-FVIII ( ΔBDD-FVIII)  By ELISA:   
   
    
    [0108]
     Stable CHO clones expressing mutated recombinant Factor VIII protein is analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples are collected from 96 well plate and coated onto ELISA plates for analysis. The basic principle of an ELISA is to use an enzyme to detect binding of antigen and antibody. Enzyme converts a colorless substrate to a colored product, indicating the presence of antigen: antibody complex.

     The two glass plates are assembled on a clean surface by keeping the longer glass plate containing spacers at the back and short thin plate in front. This glass plate sandwich is gently placed into the clamp assembly and tightened. This clamp assembly is placed on the casting stand, firmly against the rubber gasket at the base. The Resolving gel (8%) is prepared by mixing the appropriate concentration of the components gently, ensuring no air bubbles formation. The resolving gel is poured into the glass plate assembly. The gel is overlaid with butanol to ensure a flat surface and to exclude air. The butanol is washed off with water after the gel is set. Stacking gel (5%) is prepared and then poured on top of resolving gel. Comb (1 mm) is inserted gently and the gel is allowed to set. Then the comb is removed slowly. The gel assembly is placed in the buffer chamber and running buffer is added into the chamber. The sample is prepared by mixing the sample dye (2X) (reducing dye) with samples in the ratio of 1:1. Then the sample mixture is boiled for 5 min at 70°C, and centrifuged. 20 µl of the sample is loaded in the well and run at 100V for 90 min.

 Procedure 
 
   
    
    [0139]
     SDS-PAGE gel is run at 100V, according to the procedure explained in section SDS-PAGE procedure section, till the blue dye front reaches the bottom of the gel. To transfer proteins from gel to nitrocellulose membrane, materials used for transfer are soaked in transfer buffer for 15 min. Then they are stacked in the following order; case (clear side), sponge, Whatman paper, membrane, gel, Whatman paper, sponge case (black side) and placed in the transfer apparatus with black side facing black. The apparatus is immersed into ice filled bucket to cool the transfer buffer. Transfer is carried out at 90V for 90 min using Bio-Rad electro transfer apparatus. After transfer, the membrane is stained with 1X Ponceau S for a min, the bands marked with pencil, destained in water and rinsed in 1X PBS. Then the membrane is blocked for 1 h in 50 ml of 1X PBS + 5% non-fat dry milk + 0.1% Tween 20 on a shaker. Then the membrane is incubated with 1:3000 dilution of primary antibody in blocking buffer and incubated at RT for 1h or 4°C overnight. The membrane is incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilutions) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Between each step the membrane is washed three times with wash buffer containing PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). One tablet, dissolved in 10 ml of water, provides 10 ml of ready to use buffered substrate solution. The substrate solution contains BCIP (0.15 mg/ml), NBT (0.30 mg/ml), Tris buffer (100 mM), and MgCl2 (5 mM), pH 9.25-9.75. The membrane is incubated in the substrate solution for 5 min.

 Purification of recombinant Factor VIII 
 
 
   
    
    [0143]
     The protein of interest (wild type and double mutant recombinant Factor VIII) is purified using histidine ligand affinity chromatography (HLAC). The column is packed with 1mL of Histidine-Bisoxirine-Sepharose-4B gel. The column is equilibrated with binding buffer 20mM Tris pH 6.0. Cell culture supernatant containing the desired protein is loaded to the column after adjusting the pH of the supernatant to pH6.0 at a flow rate of 2ml per minute. After injecting the sample, all the non retained proteins are washed with the binding buffer till the baseline is achieved. The target protein is eluted with 20mM Tris containing 0.1M Glycine, 0.03M Lysine and 0.3M CaCl 2  at pH 7.0. The eluted peaks are concentrated using Amicon filters and analyzed on SDS-PAGE and the protein concentration is calculated by Bradford method. The purified fraction is confirmed by western blot analysis. 
     
    
    [0144]
     Even though HLAC has been used successfully in the purification of a number of recombinant and native proteins, high value therapeutic proteins with high molecular weight such as recombinant Factor VIII has not been reported to be purified using this technique. This is the first report which shows the purification of recombinant Factor VIII from cell culture supernatant using HLAC.

 Procedure 
 
   
    
    [0147]
     Cell culture supernatant containing BDD-FVIII and mutated BDD-FVIII protein (2 mg/ 50 ml) is loaded onto 1 ml Histidine-Bisoxirine-Sepharose 4B column, which is equilibrated with the equilibration/binding buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After injecting the sample, all the non retained proteins are washed with the binding buffer till the baseline is achieved. The target protein is eluted with elution buffer 20 mM Tris containing 0.1M Glycine, 0.03M Lysine and 0.3M CaCl 2 . Protein concentration is determined by Bradford's assay. The purity of the eluted protein is analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

    [0148]
     CHO cells are cultured in serum free media. Cell culture supernatant is collected after 48 hours. Cell culture supernatant containing mutated recombinant Factor VIII is subjected to affinity chromatography. Histidine-Bisoxirine-Sepharose-4B column is equilibrated with binding buffer 20mM Tris pH 6.0. The pH of cell culture supernatant is adjusted to 6.0 and directly injected to the column after filtration with 0.22µm filter. Flow through and elutions are collected for further analysis. The protein is eluted using 20mM Tris + 0.1M Glycine + 0.03M Lysine + 0.3M CaCl2 pH 7.0. The chromatogram shows a single peak ( Figure 3A ). SDS-PAGE analysis shows a clear band corresponding to full length FVIII ( Figure 3B , Lane 5) which is confirmed by Western analsysis ( Figure 5 ). The double arrows in  Figure 3  correspond to fragments of FVIII which is also observed in purified commercial FVIII (Lane 6).

     The heavy chain and light chain linkage of BDD-FVIII is stabilized only through metal ion. In the electrophoretic system, the electric current present will disrupt this linkage before the domain rearrangement happens. This explains the presence of the heavy chain and light chain separately due to the disruption in the linkage.

 Activity Assays 
 
 
   
    
    [0150]
     To confirm the presence of Factor VIII, one stage clotting assay and chromogenic assays are performed. 
   
 One stage clotting assay 
 
   
    
    [0151]
     Factor VIII deficient plasma is dissolved in distilled or deionized water. Before use, it is allowed to stand for at least 15 minutes at 15 to 25°C, and then mixed carefully without foam formation. Wild type recombinant BDD Factor VIII and mutated BDD-FVIII sample produced in CHO cell lines are added to FVIII deficient plasma. APTT reagents are used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.025M of CaCl 2  is added to the mixture. The mixture is incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes and the reading is taken in an automated coagulation analyzer. Normal clotting time is 30-40 seconds. 
   
 Chromogenic assay 
 
   
    
    [0152]
     For the photometric determination of Factor VIII activity, chromogenic assay is done. In the presence of Calcium and phospholipids, factor x is activated to factor Xa by factor IXa. This generation is stimulated by Factor VIII. The rate of activation of factor X solely depends on the amount of Factor VIII. Factor IXa hydrolyses the chromogenic substrate S-2765, thus liberating the chromophoric group, pNA. The color is then read photometrically at 405nm. The generated factor Xa and thus the intensity of the color are directly proportional to the Factor VIII activity in the sample. The said chromogenic assay is further detailed as follows. 
     
    
    [0153]
     Appropriate amount of BDD-FVIII and mutated BDD-FVIII sample is taken in plastic test tubes. Specific controls for plasma or Factor VIII concentrates is calibrated against the international standard of Factor VIII. The detection limit is 0.05IU/mL and low range of 0.005IU/mL is detected in case of low range. 
     
    
    [0154]
     After reconstituting the Factor (Factor VIII, Factor IX, and Factor X) reagents, chromogenic substrate along with inhibitor is reconstituted and then the buffer is prepared.
