 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to the method being prepared the carotenoid comprising astaxanthin by fermentable. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Carotenoid is the natural pigment that can be used as fodder additives, foodstuff additive, medicine etc.Carotenoid comprises: such as astaxanthin (astaxanthin), canthaxanthin (canthaxanthin), zeaxanthin (zeaxanthin),
         β -cryptoxanthin (
         β -cryptoxanthin), Lyeopene (lycopene),
         β -carotene (
         β -carotene), phoenicoxanthin (phoenicoxanthin), ADX (adonixanthin), myoxanthin (echinenone), asteroidenone and 3-hydroxyechinenon (3-hydroxyechinenone) etc.
       
 In carotenoid, astaxanthin also can be used as fodder additives such as cultivation the body colour activator of fish and salmon, trout, sea bream etc. or the yolk yellow activator of poultry etc.In addition, astaxanthin is as the natural additive for foodstuff of safety or heath food raw material, and the value in its industry is high. 
 The industrial production process of ADX and phoenicoxanthin is established, is expected to the same as with astaxanthin fodder additives, foodstuff additive, medicine etc. thus.And,
         β -carotene is used as fodder additives, foodstuff additive, medicine etc., and canthaxanthin is used as fodder additives, foodstuff additive, makeup etc., and zeaxanthin is then used as foodstuff additive, fodder additives etc.In addition, Lyeopene, myoxanthin,
         β -cryptoxanthin, 3-hydroxyechinenon, asteroidenone etc. are also expected to be used as fodder additives, food raw material etc.As the preparation method of above-mentioned carotenoid, there will be a known chemical synthesis, the method extracted from crude substance, utilize microorganism to carry out the method etc. of producing.
       
 On the other hand, as the chemical synthesis of astaxanthin, such as, there will be a known the method (non-patent literature 1) utilizing β-carotene to carry out changing and the method (non-patent literature 2) of being synthesized by C15 microcosmic salt.The astaxanthin prepared by this chemical synthesis is sold as fodder additives.In addition, because astaxanthin is present in the crustaceans such as the fish such as sea bream, salmon and shrimp, crab, krill, therefore can also extract from above-mentioned fish and crustaceans. 
 As utilizing microorganism to produce the method for astaxanthin, someone reports following methods: such as utilize green algae Haematocoocus Pluvialls (
         haematococcuspluvialis ) culture method (patent documentation 1), utilize red yeast phaffiafhodozyma (
         phaffiarhodozyma ) fermentation method (patent documentation 2) and utilization belong to paracoccus (
         paracoccus ) the fermentation method of bacterium (following, be sometimes called " paracoccus bacterium ").
       
 The example belonging to the bacterium of paracoccus producing astaxanthin has: E-396 strain and A-581-1 strain (patent documentation 3 and non-patent literature 3).As the bacterium belonging to paracoccus of other production of astaxanthin, can enumerate: the secondary coccus of geneva (
         paracoccusmarcusii ) MH1 strain (patent documentation 4),
         paracoccushaeundaensis bC74171 strain (non-patent literature 4), paracoccus bacterium N-81106 strain (patent documentation 5) and secondary coccus (
         paracoccussp. ) PC-1 strain (patent documentation 6) etc.
       
 But there is Railway Project in the preparation method of above-mentioned carotenoid.Such as, consider from the angle of security, chemical synthesis brings human consumer bad impression.In addition, the preparation cost extracted from the crude substance such as shrimp, crab is high.And, when being produced by green algae or yeast, except productivity is low, also owing to having firm cell walls, the therefore extraction difficulty of carotenoid. 
 On the other hand, the bacterium belonging to paracoccus has that rate of propagation is fast, productivity is high, extract the advantages such as easy, and someone reports several cultural methods of this bacterium.Such as, patent documentation 7 discloses in the method for cultivating midway interpolation molysite.Patent documentation 8 discloses the method for restriction carbon source concentration.But above-mentioned cultural method also exists following problem: while production astaxanthin, accumulate a large amount of canthaxanthins. 
 Canthaxanthin can be used as the color perfecting fodder additives of salmon or egg yolk, on the other hand, specify that in Europe ADI (allowing the amount of picked-up every day) is 0.03mg/kg body weight, the upper limit can adding canthaxanthin in regulation feed is as follows: be 25mg/kg in salmon class, be 8mg/kg (non-patent literature 5) in laying hen.Therefore, during by microorganisms producing astaxanthin, the content of canthaxanthin must be suppressed in low-level.Patent documentation 9 discloses the method reducing the production of canthaxanthin by controlling oxyty.But in the method, the production concentration of astaxanthin also significantly reduces, therefore to consider and impracticable from the angle of preparation cost.

 As aerobic condition, such as, can enumerate: shaking culture or aeration-agitation cultivation etc., but detrimentally affect can be produced to the growth of bacterium or the production of carotenoid producing astaxanthin when hypoxgia, therefore preferably use dissolved oxygen electrode often to monitor oxyty. 
 But cultivate after just starting, because microbe population is few, therefore oxyty demonstrates the numerical value close to saturation concentration, if but this microorganism starts growth, and zmount of oxygen consumption increases, then oxyty reduces gradually.Can by from cultivation to being defined as Initial stage of culture during oxyty is down to a certain degree, such as 0 ~ 5ppm, preferably 1 ~ 4ppm, by after this until production of astaxanthin concentration is defined as during reaching maximum and cultivates mid-term, cultivating latter stage by after reaching maximum from production of astaxanthin concentration to being defined as during cultivation terminates. 
 At Initial stage of culture, in order to make oxyty reach span of control as soon as possible, can air flow, agitation revolution, pressure setting be obtained slightly lower.But keep the agitation revolution of the minimum needed for the admixture of culture to be required well, the pressurization preventing miscellaneous bacteria to be mixed into required minimum is required. 
 Cultivating mid-term is microorganism oxygen consumption most active period.Wherein, when aeration-agitation is not enough, oxyty reaches zero, i.e. oxygen depletion, brings detrimentally affect to the production of microbial growth or carotenoid.Therefore, cultivating mid-term, preferably controlling oxyty and do not exhaust to make oxygen.The control of oxyty such as can be undertaken by the oxygen concn etc. changed in agitation revolution, air flow, interior pressure, ventilation gas. 
 In present method, in the cultivation of bacterium producing astaxanthin, the oxyty also existed in culture more raises, and relative to the tendency that the production concentration of the canthaxanthin of astaxanthin more reduces, the oxyty therefore in cultivation culture in mid-term preferably controls at more than 1ppm, more preferably more than 1.5ppm, further preferred more than 2ppm, particularly preferably more than 2.5ppm.The upper limit of span of control of oxyty in the culture cultivating mid-term is not particularly limited, but preferably below 8ppm, more preferably below 7ppm, further preferably below 6ppm, be particularly preferably below 5ppm. 
 Oxyty in cultivation culture in mid-term can control at certain level, but reaches high astaxanthin concentration in order to suppress while canthaxanthin concentration in culture, and it is also effective for periodically or continuously improving this oxyty.The number of times in stage is not particularly limited, as long as more than 1 stage, such as can raising 0.2ppm per hour, need 20 hours etc. semicontinuous or improve continuously.The lower limit of the oxyty (i.e. initial stage oxyty) before the oxyty periodically or continuously improved in culture is not limited, but preferably more than 1ppm, more preferably more than 1.5ppm, more preferably more than 2ppm, the upper limit is not also limited, but be preferably below 3.5ppm, more preferably below 3ppm, more preferably below 2.5ppm.In addition, the lower limit of the oxyty after the oxyty periodically or continuously improved in culture is not limited, but preferred more than 2.5ppm, more preferably more than 3ppm, more preferably more than 3.5ppm.Also do not limit the upper limit, but be preferably below 8ppm, be more preferably below 7ppm, preferred below 6ppm, is particularly preferably below 5ppm further. 
 Cultivating mid-term, the time starting the oxyty improved in culture periodically or is continuously not particularly limited, but be preferably from enter to cultivate mid-term 0 hour ~ 60 hours, more preferably 2 hour ~ 50 hours, further preferably 4 hours ~ 40 hours, be particularly preferably 6 hours ~ 30 hours.Do not limit from initial stage property ground or the oxyty improved in culture reaches the highest oxyty continuously time.When displacement for 1 stage, the highest oxyty can be reached within 1 hour.When for semicontinuity more than two benches or successional increase, do not limit from starting to improve the time reaching maximum concentration the oxyty in culture, but be preferably 2 hours ~ 120 hours, more preferably 4 hours ~ 100 hours, further preferably 6 hours ~ 90 hours, particularly preferably 8 hour ~ 80 hours, most preferably be 10 hours ~ 70 hours. 
 In addition, also preferably can gather culture at any time mid-term in cultivation, improve in cultivation while analysis classes carotene composition or reduce the oxyty in culture, making canthaxanthin concentration reach the numerical value of hope with the ratio of astaxanthin concentration.That is, when the ratio of canthaxanthin/astaxanthin is higher than desired value, the control set(ting)value improving the oxyty in culture is effective; And when the ratio of canthaxanthin/astaxanthin is low, the oxyty reduced in culture is effective. 
 Cultivating latter stage, the oxygen consumption activity of microorganism reduces, the increase of thalline or the production of carotenoid stop, the control of the oxyty therefore in culture need not resemble to cultivate mid-term to be carried out closely, but can continue to carry out oxyty control as cultivating the later stage in mid-term, also can cultivate under certain stirring, certain air flow. 
 Carry out according to the method described above cultivating, cultivate and terminate canthaxanthin concentration in the rear culture finally obtained and be preferably below 25 quality % with the ratio of astaxanthin concentration, more preferably below 20 quality %, further preferably below 15 quality %, further preferably below 8 quality %, particularly preferably below 6 quality %, most preferably be below 4 quality %.In addition, cultivate terminate after culture in canthaxanthin concentration can not there is lower limit especially with the ratio of astaxanthin concentration, but preferably more than 0.5 quality %, be more preferably more than 1.0 quality %.The culture that in culture after cultivation terminates, canthaxanthin and the ratio of astaxanthin are below 25 quality % is suitable for feed to be added, and the culture that canthaxanthin and the ratio of astaxanthin are below 8 quality % is adapted at using in food.
