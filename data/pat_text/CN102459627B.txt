 background of invention 
 
 Glyceryl phosphatide is the main ingredient of biological enzyme, and it comprises glycerine core, and on the sn-1 position that lipid acid is connected to glycerine core as R base and sn-2 position, and polar head-group is connected to sn-3 position place by phosphodiester bond.Concrete polar head-group (such as phosphatidic acid, choline, thanomin, glycerine, inositol, Serine, Val) decides the name to specific glyceryl phosphatide, resulting in phosphatidylcholine [" PC "], phosphoric acid acyl thanomin [" PE "], phosphatidyl glycerol [" PG "], phosphatidylinositols [" PI "], phosphatidylserine [" PS "] and Val [" CL "].Glyceryl phosphatide has huge diversity, and this is not only caused by variable phosphoryl head base, but also because the chain length of their lipid acid is different with degree of saturation.Generally speaking, saturated is esterified in sn-1 position with monounsaturated lipid acid, and polyunsaturated fatty acid is esterified in sn-2 position. 
 The biosynthesizing of glyceryl phosphatide is complicated.Following table 1 summarizes the step of the de novo synthesis described by Kennedy and Weiss (J.Biol.Chem., 222:193-214 (1956)) at first: 
 
 table 1: glyceryl phosphatide is biosynthetic General reactions from the beginning 
 
 
 
 
 After their de novo synthesis, glyceryl phosphatide can experience the quick upset of the fatty acyl composition in sn-2 position.This " reconstruct ", or " acyl group editor ", the structure and function for film, the biological answer-reply to pressure condition and be important to lipid acid composition and the manipulation of quantity in biotechnology applications.Specifically, this reconstruct de-acyl reaction that is considered to glyceryl phosphatide and the lysophospholipid that obtains subsequently again caused by acidylate. 
 In Lands circulation (Lands, W.E, J.Biol.Chem., 231:883-888 (1958)), reconstruct and occurred by following collaborative reaction: 1) Phospholipid hydrolase, such as phospholipase A
         2 , from the sn-2 position release fat acid of phosphatidylcholine; With, 2) Acyl-coenzyme A: lysophospholipid acyltransferase [" LPLAT "], such as lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase [" LPCAT "], make lyso-phosphatidylcholine [" LPC "] in sn-2 position acidylate again.Other glyceryl phosphatide also can relate to reconstruct under their corresponding lysophospholipid acyltransferase active functions, comprises and has the LPLAT enzyme that haemolysis phosphoric acid acyl thanomin acyltransferase [" LPEAT "] is active, hemolytic phosphatidylserine acyltransferase [" LPSAT "] is active, lysophosphatidyl glycerol acyltransferase [" LPGAT "] is active and LPI acyltransferase [" LPIAT "] is active.In all cases, LPLAT is responsible for from the Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse of cell, remove Acyl-coenzyme A lipid acid and the multiple lysophospholipid substrate in Acylated phosphatide storehouse, sn-2 position.Finally, LPLAT also comprises the from the beginning biosynthetic LPAAT enzyme related to from LPA to PA.The active protein families different from two structures of LPCAT is associated, and one of them belongs to LPAAT protein families and another belongs to film in conjunction with O-acyltransferase [" MBOAT "] protein families.
       
 In the other cases, the reconstruct of this sn-2 position is considered to forward and caused (Stymne S. and A.K.Stobart of backward reaction of the enzyme with LPCAT activity, Biochem J., 223 (2): 305-314 (1984)). 
 The nearest several sections of summaries of the people such as Shindou provide general introduction (J.Biol.Chem., 284 (1): 1-5 (2009) of the function to glyceryl phosphatide biosynthesizing and LPLAT; J.Lipid Res., 50:S46-S51 (2009)).The a variety of LPLAT based on multiple conservative motif have been reported in open source literature and patent documentation. 
 Biosynthesizing due to lipid acid needs the rapid exchange of carboxyl groups between Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse and phosphatide storehouse, and LPLAT is also conceived on the impact that polyunsaturated fatty acid [" PUFA "] is produced.Specifically, desaturation mainly occurs in the sn-2 position of phosphatide, and extends in Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse and occur.Such as, international application published WO 2004/076617 describes the separation of a kind of LPCAT from Caenorhabditis elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) (clone T06E8.1), and reports when this LPCAT is using 18:2 or the alpha-linolenic acid [" ALA " of external source respectively; 18:3] lipid acid raise through biotechnology transformation Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) bacterial strain in express time, the raising of the efficiency that Δ 6 desaturation and Δ 6 extend, and EDA [" EDA "; 20:2] and eicosatetraenoic acid [" ETA "; 20:4] biosynthesizing divide other to improve. 
 In addition, the embodiment 16 of international application published WO 2004/087902 describes the separation of Mortierella alpina (Mortierella alpina) LPAAT-sample protein identical except having N and hold the extension of 28 amino-acid residues in SEQ ID NO:93 (by the protein coding of SEQ ID NO:93 and SEQ ID NO:95, having 417 amino acid whose length or 389 amino acid whose length respectively).International application published WO 2004/087902 there was reported a kind of expression to those the similar methods in international application published WO 2004/076617 in these protein, expresses and result in the biosynthetic similar improvement of EDA and ETA. 
 The biosynthetic improvement that international application published WO 2004/076617 and WO 2004/087902 teaches EDA and ETA is because LPCAT reversible in some LPAAT-sample protein is active, although not every LPAAT-sample protein all has LPCAT activity.They do not instruct the expression of LPCAT not needing external source to supply improvement in the bacterial strain of fatty acid substrate or in microbial species beyond Saccharomyces cerevisiae by causing.They do not instruct LPCAT to cause the high LC-PUFA beyond EDA and ETA in the expression in genetic engineering modified microorganism yet, such as ARA, EPA and DHA, the raising of production, or the expression of LPCAT can cause the improvement of the substituting desaturation reaction beyond Δ 6 desaturation.Two parts of reference all do not instruct LPCAT or LPAAT-sample protein to extend the Δ 6 not having external source to supply lipid acid or on the desat impact of Δ 4. 
 The coexpression that many parts of other reference generally describe LPLAT and PUFA biosynthesis gene for improve in the oil of genetically modified organism desired lipid acid amount, improve total oil-contg or optionally improve the beneficial effect (such as, international application published WO2004/087902, WO 2006/069936, WO 2006/052870, WO 2009/001315, WO2009/014140) of content of desired lipid acid. 
 Although there is above-mentioned work, also nobody studied at LPAAT and LPCAT in genetic engineering modified oil-containing biology for LC-PUFA (the such as timnodonic acid [" EPA " beyond EDA and ETA so far; 20:5OMEGA-3] and/or docosahexenoic acid [" DHA "; 22:6OMEGA-3]) high level production and for the C that improves when not having external source to supply lipid acid
         18 -C
         20 extend the effect of the Δ 4 desaturation transformation efficiency of transformation efficiency and/or improvement.

 Alternatively, the LPLAT sequence that can openly obtain or their motif can be the hybridizing reagents for the identification of homologue.Hybridizing method is well known for ordinary skill in the art, as indicated above. 
 The homologue of any LPLAT nucleic acid fragment or any qualification can be used for from identical or other algae, fungi, oomycetes, class eye worm, stramenopiles, be separated the gene of encoding homologous proteins yeast or plant species.It is well known in the art for using sequence dependent code to be separated homologous gene.The example of sequence dependent code includes but not limited to: 1) nucleic acid hybridization; 2) the various application of DNA and RNA amplification method such as nucleic acid amplification technologies, such as, polymerase chain reaction [" PCR "] (United States Patent (USP) 4,683,202); Ligase chain reaction [" LCR "] (people such as Tabor, S., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A., 82:1074 (1985)); Or strand displacement amplification reaction [" SDA "] (people such as Walker, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A., 89:392 (1992); And 3) library construction and complementation method. 
 Such as, for the gene of the proteins encoded similar to the LPLAT gene that can openly obtain or their motif or polypeptide, all or part of as DNA hybridization probe by the nucleic acid fragment that can openly obtain with those, utilizes well known method screening to be directly separated them from the library of any desired biology.Based on openly obtaining nucleotide sequence, specific oligonucleotide probe is by methods known in the art (Maniatis, see above) design and synthesis.Such as, and whole sequence can be directly used in by method known to the skilled, and random primer DNA marker, nick translation or end-labelling, carry out synthesized dna probe, or use can in-vitro transcription system synthesize rna probe.In addition, can Auele Specific Primer be designed and for increase part or total length obtainable sequence or their motif are disclosed.The amplified production of gained can directly mark or mark after amplified reaction in amplified reaction process, and is used as the DNA fragmentation that probe is separated total length under suitable stringent condition. 
 Usually, in the amplification technique of PCR type, primer has different sequence and not complementary each other.Depend on required testing conditions, primer sequence should be designed to provide copying of not only effective but also reliable target nucleic acid.PCR primer method of design is common and well known (Thein and Wallace, " The use of as specific hybridization probes in the Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders ", Human Genetic Diseases:A Practical Approach, K.E.Davis edits, (1986) pp 33-50, IRL:Herndon, VA; Rychlik, W., In Methods in Molecular Biology, White, B.A. edit, (1993) Vol.15, pp 31-39, PCR Protocols:Current Methods and Applications.Humania:Totowa, NJ). 
 Usually, two short-movie sections of obtainable LPLAT sequence can be used in PCR code the longer nucleic acid fragment from DNA or RNA amplification encoding homologous genes.Also can carry out PCR to the nucleic acid fragment library of clone, the sequence of one of them primer derives from obtainable nucleic acid fragment or their motif.The polyadenylic acid sheet that other primer sequences utilize mRNA precursor coding genes 3 ' end to exist. 
 Alternatively, second primer sequence can based on the sequence deriving from cloning vector.Such as, technician can according to the RACE code (people such as Frohman, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A., 85:8998 (1988)), produce cDNA by the copy in the region between holding with pcr amplification Single locus and 3 ' or 5 ' in transcript.With 3 ' and 5 ' primer of direction orientation can from utilizing obtainable sequences Design.Use 3 ' RACE or 5 ' RACE system (such as BRL of commercially available acquisition, Gaithersburg, MD), specific 3 ' or 5 ' cDNA fragment (people such as Ohara can be separated, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A., 86:5673 (1989); The people such as Loh, Science, 243:217 (1989)). 
 Based on any one in discussed these well known methods, in any preferred eukaryote selected, qualification and/or separation LPLAT gene homolog will be possible.The activity of the LPLAT gene of any presumption can easily by being confirmed, because C at this gene of host living beings expression in vivo producing LC-PUFA

 LPCAT has been assumed to be that the accumulation for the EPA of Yarrowia lipolytica TAG component may be important before this.(U.S. Patent Publication 2006-0115881-A1).As described in this document, this hypothesis is based on following research: 1) Stymne S. and A.K.Stobart (Biochem J., 223 (2): 305-314 (1984)) exchange that, they suppose between Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse and PC storehouse may be forward due to LPCAT and backward reaction; 2) Domergue, F. people (J.Bio.Chem. is waited, 278:35115 (2003)), they propose GLA ARA in the accumulation and yeast of the sn-2 position of PC can not be because relate to the biosynthetic extension step of PUFA and occur in Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse by synthesis effectively, and Δ 5 and Δ 6 desaturation step mainly occur in the sn-2 position of PC; 3) Abbadi, A. people (The Plant Cell is waited, 16:2734-2748 (2004)), they according in transgenosis oil seed plant to the analysis of PUFA accumulation restriction, propose LPCAT and extend at Δ 6 desaturases/Δ 6 in the successful reconstruct of enzymatic pathway and play keying action; With 4) international application published WO 2004/076617A2 (Renz, A. people is waited), they provide the gene [" CeLPCAT "] of coding from the LPCAT of Caenorhabditis elegans (T06E8.1), in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the Exogenous Fatty Acid substrate supply extended with applicable Δ 6, this gene substantially increases Δ 6 desaturases/Δ 6 that genetically engineered imports and extends extension efficiency in enzymatic pathway.The people such as Renz infer; the exchange that LPCAT allows the lipid acid of new synthesis effective and lasting between phosphatide and Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse, because desaturase catalysis double bond extends the extension of the lipid acid (Acyl-coenzyme A) of enzyme ad hoc catalysis coenzyme A esterification to the introducing in the lipid acid of PC-coupling.But international application published WO 2004/076617 does not instruct CeLPCAT to extend on Δ 5 impact that transformation efficiency, Δ 4 desaturation transformation efficiency or the Δ 6 in the host cell not having exogenous supply lipid acid extend transformation efficiency. 
 Demonstrate accumulation really important of LPAAT and LPCAT for EPA and DHA in the TAG part of Yarrowia lipolytica herein.But, unexpectedly, find that the process LAN of LPLAT can cause Δ 9 to extend the improvement of enzymatic conversion efficiency and/or Δ 4 desaturase transformation efficiency.As hereinbefore defined, term " transformation efficiency " refers to specific enzyme, and such as Δ 4 desaturase or Δ 9 extend enzyme, can be the efficiency of product by substrate conversion.Therefore, transformed to produce in the bacterial strain of EPA, the improvement that Δ 9 extends enzymatic conversion efficiency is proved to be the raising causing EPA%TFA or EPA%DCW.Similarly, transformed to produce in the bacterial strain of DHA, the improvement that Δ 9 extends enzyme and/or Δ 4 desaturase transformation efficiency is proved to be the raising causing DHA%TFA or DHA%DCW. 
 PUFA desaturation occurs on phosphatide, and lipid acid extension occurs on Acyl-coenzyme A.Therefore, based on above-mentioned research, the process LAN of expection LPLAT will cause the improvement of desaturation due to the substrate availability improved in phosphatide, and expects the improvement of extension of the substrate availability that the expression of LPLAT can not cause needs to improve in coenzyme A storehouse. 
 Although there are these to suppose, embodiment 5 shows, the expression of LPLAT does not have the transformation efficiency improving whole desaturation in a comparable manner in the Ye Shi yeast strain producing DHA.Specifically, the transformation efficiency of Δ 4 desaturase is optionally improved, and similar improvement does not see in Δ 12, Δ 8, Δ 5 or Δ 17 desaturation.By inference, Δ 4 desaturase is limited due to the limited operability of DPA substrate in phosphatide. 
 In addition, embodiment 4 and 5 shows, LPLAT, based on the expression of the polynucleotide of the coding LPLAT polypeptide of at least one stable integration, significantly improves Δ 9 and extends enzymatic conversion efficiency in the Ye Shi yeast strain producing EPA and DHA respectively.But surprisingly, in DHA bacterial strain, LPLAT does not cause EPA to the C of DPA
         20/22 the comparable improvement of efficiency extended.In general, relative to those bacterial strains do not had in the bacterial strain of process LAN LPLAT, total lipid content does not change significantly.
       
 Obviously, be difficult to LPLAT at production PU 
 The effect of the process LAN in the host cell of FA carries out extensive overview.On the contrary, the effect of LPLAT activity must based on having the desaturase of given activity and extending the subclass of enzyme (that is, Δ 12 desaturase, Δ 8 desaturase, Δ 5 desaturase, Δ 17 desaturase, Δ 4 desaturase, Δ 9 extend enzyme, C
         14/16 extend enzyme, C
         16/18 extend enzyme, C
         18/20 extend enzyme [" also making Δ 6 extend enzyme "], C
         20/22 extend enzyme [" also making Δ 5 extend enzyme "]) consider.

 In general, the means being separated transformant relative to no transformed cells of the expression product of expectation, the character of host cell and proposition are depended in the concrete selection being present in the sequence in construct.Technician knows and must be present on plasmid vector successfully to transform, to select and to breed the gene of the host cell comprising mosaic gene.But usual carrier or box contain the sequence guiding the sequence of transcribing and translating of genes involved, selective marker and permission self-replicating or chromosomal integration.The carrier be applicable to comprise control transcripting starting the 5 ' region (i.e. promotor) of gene, gene coded sequence and control Transcription Termination the 3 ' region (i.e. terminator) of DNA fragmentation.Most preferably when two control regions all derive from the gene of inverting host cell, although they are natural genes without the need to deriving from production host. 
 Transcripting starting area or promotor for driving the heterologous gene in expectation host cell or part allogeneic gene expression have multiple, and well known.These control regions can comprise promotor, enhanser, son of mourning in silence, intron sequences, 3 ' UTR and/or 5 ' UTR region and albumen and/or RNA stable element.The intensity of this class component and specificity can be different.In fact, any promotor of the expression of these genes in selected host cell (namely natural, synthesis or chimeric promotor) can be instructed to be all applicable, but to be particularly useful with translated region from transcribing of host species.Expression in host cell can occur in the mode of induction type or composing type.The activity that inducible expression is operably connected to the controllable promotor of concerned LPLAT gene by induction realizes, and constitutive expression realizes by utilizing constitutive promoter. 
 3 ' non-coding sequence of encoding transcription termination area can provide in recombinant precursor, and can from 3 ' region of gene or from different genes, and wherein said 3 ' region is available from original area.A large amount of terminators is known and when the identical and different genus being used for being derived from from them and species, its function played in multiple host is satisfactory.Terminator also can come from the multiple natural gene of preferred host.Terminator is selected to be more from angle easily instead of in order to any characteristic usually. 
 With regard to the use in yeast, the terminator be particularly useful derives from yeast genes, especially saccharomyces, Schizasaccharomyces, mycocandida, Ye Shi yeast belong or genus kluyveromyces.3 ' region of the mammalian genes of encoding y-interferon and α-2 Interferon, rabbit is also known can work in yeast.3 '-district also can be synthesis, because those skilled in the art can utilize obtainable information to design and synthesize 3 '-region sequence as transcription terminator.Terminator can be nonessential, but is highly preferred. 
 The mark that carrier also can comprise optionally and/or can mark except above-mentioned controlling element.Preferably, marker gene is antibiotics resistance gene, makes the growth-inhibiting or the death that cause no transformed cells with antibiotic treatment cell, but does not suppress the growth of transformant.In order to select Yeast transformants, the any mark playing function can be used in yeast, make it the resistance had kantlex, Totomycin and amino glycoside thing G418 and also can be particularly useful lacking the mark that uridylic, Methionin, Histidine or leucic substratum grow. 
 Only gene (gene of the LPLAT that such as encodes) is inserted cloning vector and do not guarantee that it can with the expression such as speed, concentration, amount expected.In response to the needs to high expression level rate, by operating, much control is transcribed, rna stability, translation, protein stability and position, oxygen restriction and the secretion from microbial host cell different genetic elements, established many special expression vectors.Some controlled characteristics comprise: the character of relevant transcriptional promoter and terminator sequence, the copy number of institute's clone gene, and this gene is that plasmid carries or has been integrated in the genome of host cell, the final cell location of synthesized protein, the translation of protein in host living beings and correct folding efficiency, the mRNA of institute's clone gene and the protein inherent stability in host cell and the codon in institute's clone gene use, to make the preferred codon usage frequency of its frequency and host cell close.These character are often planted and all can be used in method as herein described and host cell, to optimize the expression of LPLAT gene further. 
 Such as, improve by using stronger promotor (regulation type or composing type) to cause and expressing, by removing/deleting stabilization removal sequence or by stabilizing sequences being added to mRNA (United States Patent (USP) 4 from mRNA or coded protein, 910,141), on, the expression of LPLAT can be improved on transcriptional level.Alternatively, can by the LPLAT channel genes recombinant host cell of additional copies, thus improve production and the accumulation of EPA and/or DHA, this or by cloning the gene of additional copies in single expression construct, or realize by additional copies is imported in host cell, wherein the latter is by improving plasmid copy number, or is undertaken by being integrated in genome by clone gene in multiple times. 
 Comprise the recombinant precursor of at least one mosaic gene (it comprises promotor, LPLAT open reading frame [" ORF "] and terminator) in preparation after, be placed on can in host cell self-replicating plasmid vector in, or to be directly integrated in host cell gene group.The integration of expression cassette can occur randomly in host genome, maybe can carry out target by using such construct, namely this construct contain the restructuring be enough in target host gene seat with the district of host genome homology.If construct target endogenous gene seat, then transcribe and can be provided by endogenous gene seat with the whole of translational control district or some. 
 When two or more genes are expressed from independently replicating vector, each carrier can have different selection approaches and should lack and the homology of other constructs to maintain stably express and to prevent element reprovision (reassortment) between construct.Available experimental method is determined control region, selection approach and the selecting properly of the enrichment procedure of construct introduced, so that the gene of all importings all provides the synthesis of desired product with the horizontal expression needed. 
 The construct comprising paid close attention to gene can be imported in host cell by any standard technique.These technology comprise conversion (as lithium acetate transformation (Methods in Enzymology, 194:186-187 (1991))), biolistic bombardment, electroporation, microinjection, vacuum filtration or paid close attention to gene are introduced any other method in host cell. 
 For simplicity, " conversion " or " transformant " or " recombinant chou " will be called in this article by the host cell handling to absorb DNA sequence dna (as expression cassette) by any method.The host transformed will have the copy of at least one expression construct, and can have two or more copies, this depend on this gene be integrated in genome, be amplified or be present in there is multiple copied number extra-chromosomal element on. 
 Transformed host cell is identified by selecting to import the mark that construct comprises.Alternatively, the mark construct of separation can carry out cotransformation with the construct expected, the method is the same with the multiple transformation technology multiple DNA molecular being imported host cell. 
 Typically, the ability that the host with regard to transforming grows on selective medium is selected them, and described selective medium can be mixed with microbiotic or lack the necessary factor of the host growth be not converted, such as nutritive substance or somatomedin.The marker gene imported can give antibiotics resistance, or encode required somatomedin or enzyme, thus when allowing to grow on Selective agar medium when transforming and expressing in host.Transform the selection of host also can occur in presentation markup albumen can by directly or indirectly detect time.Additional selection technique at United States Patent (USP) 7,238,482 and United States Patent (USP) 7,259, be described in 255. 
 No matter select which kind of host or expression construct, multiple transformant must be screened to obtain the bacterial strain that expression level and pattern are expected in display.Such as, the people such as Juretzek (stability that Yeast, 18:97-113 (2001) propose DNA integration fragment in Yarrowia lipolytica depends on single transformant, F-strain and target platform used.This type of screening can analyze (Southern by the Southern of southern blotting technique, J.Mol.Biol., 98:503 (1975)), the Northern of mrna expression analyzes (Kroczek, J.Chromatogr.Biomed.Appl., 618 (1-2): 133-145 (1993)), the Western of protein expression analyzes, the phenotype analytical of PUFA product or GC analyze. 
 The metabolic process that oleic acid changes into LC-PUFA wherein relates to makes carbochain extend and make molecule desaturation by adding double bond by adding carbon atom.This needs to be present in a series of special desaturase in endoplasmic reticulum and extension enzyme.But, as see in FIG and as mentioned below, there is multiple alternative route of producing for LC-PUFA. 
 Specifically, Fig. 1 describes approach hereinafter described.All approach all need by Δ 12 desaturase, oleate conversion to be become linolic acid [" LA "] (first ω-6 lipid acid) at first.Then use " Δ 9 extends enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach " and make substrate with LA, forming long-chain omega-6 lipid acid as follows: 1) extend enzyme by Δ 9 and LA is changed into eicosadienoic acid [" EDA "]; 2) by Δ 8 desaturase, EDA is changed into dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid [" DGLA "]; 3) by Δ 5 desaturase, DGLA is changed into arachidonic acid [" ARA "]; 4) C is passed through
         20/22 extend enzyme and ARA is changed into docosatetratenoic acid [" DTA "]; And, 5) by Δ 4 desaturase, DTA is changed into clupanodonic acid [" DPAn-6 "].
       
 It is as follows that " Δ 9 extends enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach " also can utilize alpha-linolenic acid [" ALA "] to produce long-chain omega-fatty acid as substrate: 1) by Δ 15 desaturase, LA is changed into ALA, first omega-fatty acid; 2) extend enzyme by Δ 9 and ALA is changed into eicosatrienoic acid [" ETrA "]; 3) by Δ 8 desaturase, ETrA is changed into eicosatetraenoic acid [" ETA "]; 4) by Δ 5 desaturase, ETA is changed into timnodonic acid [" EPA "]; 5) C is passed through
         20/22 extend enzyme and EPA is changed into clupanodonic acid [" DPA "]; And 6) by Δ 4 desaturase, DPA is changed into docosahexenoic acid [" DHA "].Optionally, Δ 6 lipid acid can change into Δ 3 lipid acid.Such as, ETA and EPA is generated by DGLA and ARA respectively by Δ 17 desaturase activity.With regard to this paper object, advantageously Δ 9 extends the EPA oil that enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach can produce the gamma-linolenic acid [" GLA "] not containing significant quantity.
       
 The alternative route of ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biological synthesis utilizes Δ 6 desaturase and C
         18/20 extend enzyme, i.e. " Δ 6 desaturases/Δ 6 extends enzymatic pathway ".More particularly, by Δ 6 desaturase, LA and ALA can be converted into GLA and therapic acid [" STA "] respectively; Then, C
         18/20 extend enzyme GLA is converted into DGLA and/or STA is converted into ETA.

 the fatty acid analysis of Yarrowia lipolytica 
 
 Lipid acid [" FA "] is analyzed, by cell by collected by centrifugation and as Bligh, E.G. and Dyer, W.J. (Can.J.Biochem.Physiol., 37:911-917 (1959)) described extraction lipid.By lipid-soluble extract and sodium methylate are carried out transesterification reaction and prepare fatty acid methyl ester [" FAME "] (Roughan, G. with Nishida I., Arch Biochem Biophys., 276th volume, 1st phase, 38-46 page (1990)) and subsequently it is analyzed with Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) being furnished with 30m × 0.25mm (internal diameter) HP-INNOWAX (Hewlett-Packard) post.Furnace temperature rises to 185 DEG C with 3.5 DEG C/min from 170 DEG C (keeping 25 minutes). 
 In order to carry out direct base-catalyzed transesterification reaction, results Ye Shi yeast cell (0.5mL culture), wash once in distilled water, and in Speed-Vac dry 5-10 minute under vacuo.By the C15:0 triacylglycerol (C15:0TAG of sodium methylate (100 μ l, concentration is 1%) and known quantity; Catalog number (Cat.No.) T-145, Nu-Check Prep, Elysian, MN) add sample, then vortex oscillation in 50 DEG C of shake samples 30 minutes.Add 3 1M NaCl and 400 μ l hexanes, then vortex oscillation rotary sample.Remove upper strata and analyze with GC. 
 The retention time of FAME peak value when comparing with known lipid acid by them via GC analytic record is identified, and is undertaken quantitatively by the peak area of the internal controls (C15:0TAG) comparing FAME and known quantity.Therefore, the approximate quantity (μ g) of any fatty acid F AME [" μ gFAME "] is calculated: (specifying the FAME peak area/standard substance FAME peak area of lipid acid) * (μ g standard substance C15:0TAG) according to following formula, the amount (μ g) of any lipid acid [" μ g FA "] is calculated: (specifying the FAME peak area/standard substance FAME peak area of lipid acid) * (μ g standard substance C15:0TAG) * 0.9503, because 1 μ g C15:0TAG equals 0.9503 μ g lipid acid according to following formula.Attention: the conversion factor of 0.9503 is the approximation of most of determination of fatty acid, its scope is between 0.95 and 0.96. 
 The lipid characteristic summarizing the amount that often kind of single lipid acid represents with TFA% weight is by being multiplied by 100 with single FAME peak area calculating divided by the sum of all FAME peak areas. 
 With regard to measure the amount of single lipid acid or total fatty acids with the per-cent of dry cell wt [" %DCW "] with regard to, by the cell of collected by centrifugation from 10mL culture, with 10mL water washing once, and again pass through collected by centrifugation.Cell is resuspended in 1-2mL water, pours into and claims in advance in overweight aluminium matter pan, and cleans with 1-2mL water, and the water of cleaning is also added in same pan.Described coiling is placed in vacuo overnight in 80 DEG C.Described dish is weighed, by deducting the Weight computation DCW of blank panel.Then, can calculate with the lipid acid (such as, FAME%DCW is calculated as μ g FAME/ μ g DCW*100) of %DCW mensuration as the part of μ g DCW based on μ gFAME or μ g FA.

 Based in table 17 and 18 about experiment 1, the data of 2 and 3, LPLAT is at EPA bacterial strain Y8406U::ScAle1S-5, Y8406U::ScAle1S-11, process LAN in Y8406U::YlAle1 and Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S result in the remarkable reduction of the LA of % by weight of TFA (18:2) concentration [" LA%TFA "] (reaching 67% or lower of contrast), the rising (reaching at least 12% of contrast) of the EPA concentration [" EPA%TFA "] in % by weight of TFA, the rising (reaching at least 16% of contrast) of enzymatic conversion efficiency is extended with Δ 9.As compared to Y8406U::ScAle1S-5 with Y8406U::ScAle1S-11, Y8406U::YlAle1 has lower LA%TFA, higher EPA%TFA, better Δ 9 and extends enzymatic conversion efficiency and lower slightly TFAs%DCW and EPA%DCW.Process LAN except MaLPAAT1S result in except lower LA%TFAs, EPA%TFAs and EPA%DCW, and Y8406U::Yl Ale1 with Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S is similar. 
 Experiment 4 display, the process LAN of LPLAT in EPA bacterial strain Y8406U::YlLPAAT1, Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S and Y8406U::CeLPCATS result in the rising (reaching at least 13% of contrast) that the remarkable reduction (reaching 67% or lower of contrast) of LA%TFA, the rising (reaching at least 9% of contrast) of EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency.Compared with Y8406U::CeLPCATS, the TFA%DCW that Y8406U::YlLPAAT1 and Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S all has lower LA%TFA, higher EPA%TFAs, higher EPA%DCW and omited.Process LAN except MaLPAAT1S result in lower LA%TFA, lower slightly EPA%TFA and EPA%DCW and lower slightly Δ 9 extends except enzymatic conversion efficiency, Y8406U::YlLPAAT1 with Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S is similar. 
 Be well known in the art, most of desaturation occurs on the sn-2 position of phosphatide, and lipid acid extension occurs on Acyl-coenzyme A.In addition, expection ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S and YlLPAAT1 only make carboxyl groups mix lysophospholipid from Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse, the such as sn-2 position of Ultrapole L [" LPA "] and lyso-phosphatidylcholine [" LPC "].Therefore, the phospholipid substrate operability owing to improving is caused desat raising by the expression of expection ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S and YlLPAAT1, and does not cause the raising of the extension needing the substrate availability improved in coenzyme A storehouse.Our data (see above) display, unexpectedly, ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S and YlLPAAT1 expression produce EPA Ye Shi yeast strain in significantly improve Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency but not improve (with Δ 12 desaturase transformation efficiency, Δ 8 desaturase transformation efficiency, Δ 5 desaturase transformation efficiency or Δ 17 desaturase transformation efficiency measure) desaturation efficiency. 
 CeLPCAT has been displayed on before this in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae of supply LA or GLA and has improved Δ 6 and extend transformation efficiency (international application published WO 2004/076617).This reversible LPCAT making lipid acid be released into coenzyme A storehouse from phosphatide owing to it is active.In international application published WO 2004/076617, and inexpectancy oil-containing microorganism is (as Yarrowia lipolytica; Through genetic engineering modified with high level production LC-PUFA) extend the improvement of transformation efficiency not supplying Δ 9 in lipid acid situation. 
 In addition, in the Ye Shi yeast strain producing EPA, the expression of ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S, YlLPAAT1 and CeLPCATS does not significantly change accumulated PUFA level or total lipid content. 
 Research formerly shows, because between phosphatide and Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse, the transfer of carboxyl groups is bad, Δ 6 extends and Δ 9 to extend be all bottleneck in long-chain PUFA biosynthesizing.Based on the raising of the A9 extension enzymatic conversion efficiency that the process LAN of shown LPCAT causes, expect that LPCAT as herein described and their ortholog thing are as Sc LPAAT, will improve Δ 6 equally and extend transformation efficiency above.

 lipid content, lipid acid composition and transformation efficiency 
 
 In each experiment, for 1,2,3 or 4 cultures [" repeat samples "] repeated of Y5037 control strain and Y5037U transformant bacterial strain, carry out quantitatively to lipid content and lipid acid composition.In addition, the data of often kind of Y5037U transformant are also shown as the per-cent accounting for Y5037 contrast.Table 19 hereafter summarizes with the concentration of often kind of lipid acid of the % weighing scale of TFA [" %TFA "].More particularly, lipid acid is accredited as 16:0 (palmitinic acid), 16:1 (Zoomeric acid), 18:0 (stearic acid), 18:1 (oleic acid), 18:2 (LA), ALA, EDA, DGLA, ARA, ETrA, ETA, EPA, DPA, DHA and EDD (adding the summation that DPA adds DHA corresponding to EPA).In addition, the ratio of DHA%TFA/DPA%TFA is additionally provided. 
 Table 20 summarize total DCW (mg/mL), cell total lipid content [" TFA%DCW "] and work in PUFA biosynthetic pathway and often kind of desaturase needed for the production of DHA and extend the transformation efficiency of enzyme.Specifically, for each Y5037 control strain and Y5037U transformant bacterial strain, provide Δ 12 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 12CE "], Δ 8 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 8CE "], Δ 5 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 5CE "], Δ 17 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 17CE "], Δ 4 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 4CE "], Δ 9 extends transformation efficiency [" Δ 9e CE "] and Δ 5 extends transformation efficiency [" Δ 5e CE "]; The data of often kind of Y5037U transformant are shown as the per-cent accounting for Y5037 contrast.Transformation efficiency calculates according to following formula: product/(product+substrate) * 100, wherein product not only comprises product but also comprise product derivative. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Based on the data in table 19 and table 20, LPLAT is at DHA bacterial strain Y5037U::CeLPCATS, process LAN in Y5037U::ScAleIS and Y5037U::MaLPAAT1S result in the reduction of the LA concentration of % by weight of TFA [" LA%TFA "], in the rising of the EPA concentration of % by weight of TFA [" EPA%TFA "], in the rising of the DHA concentration of % by weight of TFA [" DHA%TFA "], in the rising of the EPA+DPA+DHA concentration of % by weight of TFA [" EDD%TFA "] (except the bacterial strain Y5037U::ScAleIS in experiment 4), DHA%TFA is to the rising [" DHA/DPA "] of DPA%TFA ratio, Δ 9 extends the rising of enzymatic conversion efficiency and the rising of Δ 4 desaturase transformation efficiency. 
 More particularly, depend on culture condition, compared with contrast, the process LAN of CeLPCATS in Y5037U::CeLPCATS can reduce LA%TFA to 45%, raise EPA%TFA to 175%, raise DHA%TFA to 169%, raise Δ 9 extends efficiency to 124% and raises Δ 4 desaturation efficiency to 226%.Similarly, depend on culture condition, compared with contrast, the process LAN of ScAle1S in Y5037U::ScAleIS can reduce LA%TFA to 72%, raise EPA%TFA to 125%, raise DHA%TFA to 222%, raise Δ 9 extends efficiency to 113% and raises Δ 4 desaturation efficiency to 191%.Finally, compared with contrast, the process LAN of MaLPAAT1 in Y5037U::MaLPAAT1S can reduce LA%TFA to 94%, raise EPA%TFA to 115%, raise DHA%TFA to 120%, raise Δ 9 extends efficiency to 104% and raises Δ 4 desaturation efficiency to 118%. 
 Although Y5037U::CeLPCATS has significantly lower total lipid content [" TFA%DCW "] in experiment 4, in bacterial strain Y5037U::ScAleIS, total lipid content considerably improves.This raising of lipid content is the explanation possible to EDD%TFA lower in bacterial strain Y5037U::ScAleIS. 
 Two steps are related to: EPA passes through C by the DHA biosynthesizing of EPA
         20/22 extend enzyme (be also referred to as " C20 " extend enzyme or Δ 5 extends enzyme) to the extension of DPA and DPA by the desaturation of Δ 4 desaturase to DHA.The accumulation of DPA shows, from EPA to the important bottleneck the production of DHA be Δ 4 desaturation step, although the detailed mechanism of this restriction is unknown.Above result display, ScAle1S, YlAle1, YlLPAAT1, MaLPAAT1S and CeLPCATS protein expression considerably improves Δ 4 desaturation.Therefore, Δ 4 desaturation is not construed as limiting because of Δ 4 desaturase activity self.On the contrary, Δ 4 desaturation is construed as limiting because of the limited operability of the DPA substrate of phosphatide sn-2 position.The above results shows, and unexpectedly, (being different from other desaturation substrates) limited DPA can be overcome by the process LAN of Ale1, LPAAT and LPCAT protein to mixing in phosphatide.
       
 Formerly, international application published WO 2004/076617 shows, and CeLPCAT (the SEQ ID NO:2) expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae improves GLA that external source provides and extends to the Δ 6 of DGLA.It infers CeLPCAT from the sn-2 displacement of phosphatide except acyl chain, thus makes the carboxyl groups be removed be used in extension in coenzyme A storehouse.Show in this research, through genetic engineering modified with in the Yarrowia lipolytica strain of producing high-caliber EPA (embodiment 4) and DHA (embodiment 5), through the expression of codon optimized CeLPCATS under YAT1 promotor controls, the LA that improve endogenous production respectively extends to the Δ 9 of EDA.But the expression of CeLPCATS in the bacterial strain Y5037U::CeLPCATS producing DHA does not unexpectedly cause the EPA of raising to extend to the Δ 5 of DPA.On the other hand, the expression of CeLPCATS in the bacterial strain Y5037U::CeLPCATS producing DHA very substantial increases DPA and extends (see above) to the Δ 4 of DHA.This is unexpected in particular, because the sn-2 position and extending that desaturation mainly occurs in phosphatide occurs in coenzyme A storehouse. 
 Based on the raising of the Δ 4 desaturation transformation efficiency that the process LAN of shown LPCAT causes, expect that LPCAT as herein described and their ortholog thing are as ScLPAAT, will improve Δ 4 desaturation transformation efficiency equally above.

 transform and growth 
 
 Transform respectively with the uncut plasmid from embodiment 7 and understand fat Ye Shi yeast strain Y8406U (embodiment 1).Specifically, carrier pY177 (YAT1::YlLPAAT1::Lip1) [SEQ ID NO:101] and pY222 (YAT1::ScLPAATS::Lip1) [SEQ ID NO:100] has been transformed according to " general method ". 
 Each transformation mixture is laid down on MM agar plate.Several URA+ transformant obtained of picking, and be seeded to 3mL CSM-U substratum (Teknova catalog number (Cat.No.) C8140, Teknova Inc., Hollister, CA) in, wherein CSM-U substratum refers to the CM meat soup deducting uridylic containing glucose, comprises 0.13% amino acid subtracting uridylic and saves component powders, 0.17% yeast nitrogen, 0.5% (NH
         4 )
         2 sO
         4 , and 2.0% glucose.Wobbler, by collected by centrifugation culture, and is resuspended in 3mL HGM substratum (catalog number (Cat.No.) 2G2080, Teknova Inc.) after 2 days with 200rpm and 30 DEG C of growth.After wobbler grows 5 days, collect the 1mL aliquots containig of above-mentioned culture and analyzed by GC, as described in example 4 above.
       
 Lipid acid based on described 3mL culture forms, and characterizes the transformant through selecting further by flask detection method.Specifically, have selected clone #5 and #6 of the bacterial strain Y8406U transformed with expression vector pY222 (comprising ScLPAATS), and difference called after " Y8406U::ScLPAATS-5 " and " Y8406U::ScLPAATS-6 "; Have selected the clone #1 of the bacterial strain Y8406U transformed with expression vector pY177 (comprising YlLPAAT1), and called after " Y8406U::YlLPAAT1 ". 
 In addition, bacterial strain Y8406 (the Ura+ bacterial strain as the parent of bacterial strain Y8406U (Ura-)) is used as contrast. 
 Often kind of transformant through selection and contrast are rule on MM agar plate.Then, the cell of the fresh line of a transfering loop is seeded to 3mL CSM-U substratum, and in 30 DEG C with 250rpm overnight incubation.Measure OD
         600nm , in 125mL flask, add the cell of an aliquots containig, make OD final in 25mL CSM-U substratum
         600nm be 0.3 in 30 DEG C of shaking culture casees, cultivate 2 days with 250rpm after, by collected by centrifugation 6mL culture, and be resuspended in 25mL HGM in 125mL flask.After cultivating 5 days with 250rpm in 30 DEG C of shaking culture casees, use 1mL aliquots containig to carry out GC analysis (see above), and dry 10mL is used for dry cell wt [" DCW "] mensuration, as described in example 4 above.
       
 
 lipid content, lipid acid composition and transformation efficiency 
 
 For 2 cultures [" repeat samples "] repeated of Y8406 control strain and Y8406U transformant bacterial strain, the per-cent that accounts for DCW to lipid content, lipid acid composition and EPA carries out quantitatively.In addition, the data of often kind of Y8406U transformant are also shown as the per-cent accounting for Y8406 contrast.The total lipid content [" TFA%DCW "] that table 23 below summarizes cell, the concentration of often kind of lipid acid represented with the % weight of TFA [" %TFA "] and the EPA content [" EPA%DCW "] represented with the per-cent of dry cell wt.More particularly, lipid acid is accredited as 16:0 (palmitinic acid), 16:1 (Zoomeric acid), 18:0 (stearic acid), 18:1 (oleic acid), 18:2 (LA), ALA, EDA, DGLA, ARA, ETrA, ETA and EPA. 
 Table 24 works in PUFA biosynthetic pathway to summarize with the identical mode described in embodiment 4, and often kind of desaturase needed for the production of EPA and Δ 9 extend the transformation efficiency of enzyme. 
 
 
 
 Based on the data in above table 23 and table 24, the expression of ScLPAATS and YlLPAAT1 in bacterial strain Y8406U::YlLPAAT1, Y8406U::ScLPAATS-5 and Y8406U::ScLPAATS-6 of producing EPA all result in by TFA % by weight the reduction (reaching 76% or lower of contrast) of LA (18:2) concentration [" LA%TFA "], and Δ 9 extends the rising (reaching at least 7% of contrast) of enzymatic conversion efficiency.ScLPAATS with YlLPAAT1 has similar impact to lipodogramme. 
 Then, those acquisition are compared, although have employed different modes to characterize LPLAT in the result obtained above and embodiment 4.Specifically, in example 4, because carrier lacks ARS sequence, the linearizing DNA carrying LPLAT is converted by chromosomal integration.Which results in and stably integrate, and in preculture with before being ported to HGM in the growth of 2 days, bacterial strain is all grown in relative abundance, nonselective FM growth medium. 
 In embodiment 8, functionally carry out on the plasmid being characterized in self-replacation of YlLPAAT1 and ScLPAATS.Therefore, understanding fat Ye Shi yeast strain Y8406 is transformed with the cyclic DNA carrying often kind of LPAAT and ARS sequence.In order to maintain these plasmids and detect the expression of gene not have to integrate, in preculture and the growth of 2 days before being ported to HGM, transformant must be made to grow Selective agar medium (that is, CSM-U substratum) is upper. 
 These differences above-described can facilitate the difference of lipodogramme and lipid content, as in embodiment 4 and 8 by as shown in the expression of YlLPAAT1.In example 4, based on the expression of YlLPAAT, LA%TFA, EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency and are respectively 63%, 115% and 115% relative to the change of contrast, and in embodiment 8, based on the expression of YlLPAAT, LA%TFA, EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency and are respectively 76%, 101% and 107% relative to the change of contrast.Therefore, compared with viewed in embodiment 4, in embodiment 8, Δ 9 extension and the biosynthetic improvement of LC-PUFA are minimized.These differences can owing to " position effect " of chromosomal integration and/or different growth conditionss. 
 With regard to ScLPAATS and YlLPAAT with regard to being transferred into Yarrowia lipolytica strain Y8406 on autonomously replicating plasmid, LC-PUFA is biosynthetic, and to improve (being measured as the rising that the reduction of LA%TFA, the rising of EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency) be similar, expects that these two kinds of LPLAAT will play similar function equally when stable integration enters host chromosome.Therefore, ScLPAATS probably will be improved lipodogramme to be stably integrated into viewed similar mode in the embodiment 4 and 5 of host chromosome to YlLPAAT1.
