Background of the Invention Microbes represent an invaluable source of novel genes and compounds that have the potential to be utilised in a range of industrial sectors. Scientific literature gives numerous accounts of microbes being the primary source of antibiotics, immune-suppressants, anticancer agents and cholesterol-lowering drugs, in addition to their use in environmental decontamination and in the production of food and cosmetics. A relatively unexplored group of microbes known as endophytes, which reside in the tissues of living plants, offer a particularly diverse source of novel compounds and genes that may provide important benefits to society, and in particular, agriculture. Endophytes often form mutualistic relationships with their hosts, with the endophyte conferring increased fitness to the host, often through the production of defence compounds. At the same time, the host plant offers the benefits of a protected environment and nutriment to the endophyte. Other microbes, such as bacteria which can reside in the tissues of living plants, are also relatively unexplored in this setting. Plant-borne bacteria offer similar benefits. The Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex is a component of the grass family Poaceae, with representatives distributed throughout tropical regions, particularly in Africa.    Genetic diversity analysis based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nuclear ribosomal DNA  sequence data indicates a strong affinity between Urochloa and Brachiaria, supporting morphological and anatomical studies that show a continuous gradation between these grass genera. Some Brachiaria-Urochloa species are economically significant tropical forage grasses that have been released as commercial cultivars and include B.  brizantha, B. decumbens, B. humidicola, and B. ruziziensis, as well as corresponding interspecific and intraspecific hybrids. Methods for the identification and characterization of novel endophytes and their deployment in Brachiaria-Urochloa plant improvement programs have been discussed in W02012/174585, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.  Strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from Brachiaria-Urochloa species.  These brachiaria fungal endophytes were genetically diverse. Some of these endophytes exhibited broad spectrum anti-fungal activity and may play a role in protecting Brachiaria-Urochloa from fungal pathogens, such as Drechslera spp., which cause leaf spots. There remains a general lack of information and knowledge of the fungal endophytes of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex as well as of methods for the identification and characterisation of novel endophytes and their deployment in Brachiaria-Urochloa plant improvement programs. There is also a general lack of information and knowledge of the bacterial endophytes of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex as well as of methods for the identification and characterisation of novel bacterial organisms and their deployment in Brachiaria-Urochloa plant improvement programs. Furthermore, although widely used for pasture-based agriculture in tropical regions of South America, Asia and Australia, Brachiaria-Urochloa exhibits a number of shortcomings that constrain both its use and genetic enhancement. Forage grasses, including Brachiaria-Urochloa, have also been recognised in recent years for implications in nitrogen pollution. A major concern of modern production in agriculture is the high level of nitrogen (N) pollution and low efficiency of N utilisation.  N losses from denitrification results in environmental pollution and inefficient use of both soil N and applied N (as fertiliser). Nitrification is carried out primarily by two groups of chemo-lithotrophic bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrobacter spp), ubiquitous components of the soil microbial population. For example, nitrifying soil bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas spp convert ammonium (NH4) to nitrate (NO3-). Nitrate can also be converted to nitrous oxide (N20)  
 3 gas. Inhibition of nitrification may keep N in soil for longer and improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). A bioluminescence assay using a recombinant strain of Nitrosomonas europaea has been developed to detect nitrification inhibitors released from plant roots, making it possible to determine and compare the biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) capacity of different crops and pastures (Subbarao etal., 2006). The concept of plants releasing inhibitory compounds that suppress soil nitrification has previously been suggested. Several researchers have observed a slow rate of nitrification in soils of certain tropical grassland and forest soils. BNI is the ability of certain plant species to release organic compounds from their roots that have a targeted suppressive effect on soil nitrifying bacteria (Subbarao etal., 2006 2009). Brachialactone is the major nitrification inhibitor released from roots of B.  humidicola (Subbarao et al. 2009).                                                        Brachialactone belongs to a group of diterpenes called Fusicoccanes. Fusicoccanes have been identified and isolated from a diverse range of plants, fungi and bacteria. Brachialactone has been shown to exhibit biocidal activity against Nitrosomonas spp (Subbarao et al. 2009). N is then available to plant, increasing pasture performance. Literature has suggested that this compound is produced by the plant in response to ammonium in the root environment (Subbarao et al. 2009). It is an object of the present invention to overcome, or at least alleviate, one or more of the difficulties or deficiencies associated with the prior art.    Summary of the Invention In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for isolating, selecting and/or characterising an endophyte strain, said method including: providing samples of plant material from plant species of the Brachiaria-Urochoa species complex; subjecting said samples to metagenomic analysis; identifying bacterial and/or fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in each Brachiaria-Urochoa plant species; comparing the OTUs present in each sample species to identify core, supplemental and/or unique microbiomes; and  
 4 selecting endophyte strains representing a desired core, supplemental or unique microbiome. By an endophyte strain is meant a bacterial or fungal strain that is closely associated with a plant, preferably a plant of the Brachiaria-Urochoa species complex. By 'associated with' in this context is meant that the bacteria or fungus lives on, in or in close proximity to the plant. For example, it may be endophytic, for example living within the internal tissues of the plant, or epiphytic, for example growing externally on the plant. The plant material used to prepare the samples is from a plant of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex. More particularly, the plant of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex is selected from the group consisting of Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria decumbens, Brachiaria humidicola, Brachiaria stolonifera, Brachiaria ruziziensis, Urochloa brizantha, Urochloa decumbens, Urochloa humidicola, Urochloa mosambicensis, Brachiaria marlothii, Brachiaria nigropedata, Urochloa dictyoneura, Urochloa oligotricha, Urochloa panicoides, Brachiaria obtusiflora, Brachiaria serrifolia, Urochloa advena, Urochloa arrecta, Urochloa brachyura, Urochloa eminhi Urochloa mollis, Urochloa xantholeuca, Urochloa oligotricha, Urochloa panicoides, Urochloa plantaginea, Urochloa platynota, Urochloa xantholeuca, Brachiaria holosericea, Brachiaria reptans, Brachiaria milliformis, and Brachiaria distachya, as well as interspecific and intraspecific hybrids of Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the plant of the Brachiaria-Urochloa complex is selected from the group consisting of Brachiaria brizantha, Brachiaria decumbens, Brachiaria humidicola, Brachiaria ruziziensis and Urochloa mosambicensis. Preferably, the samples of plant material are selected from the group consisting of leaf, stem, root and seed material. Even more preferably, samples of leaf, stem and root types are provided.     Alternatively, samples of seed are provided. In another preferred embodiment samples of leaf, stem, root and seed material are provided. By 'subjecting said samples to metagenomic analysis' as used herein is meant that metagenomic sequence data is generated from the plant material. More particularly, genetic material recovered from the plant samples is analysed to produce bacterial and/or fungal sequence data.     The term 'recovering genetic material' includes the extraction of genetic material, including DNA, from the sample of plant material. The genetic material recovered from the plant samples may be enriched for DNA  from  
 5    endophytic strains (such as bacterial and/or fungal DNA) closely associated with the plant, as part of the process of recovering the genetic material from the sample of plant material. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the step of providing samples of plant material from plant species of the Brachiaria-Urochoa species complex includes the steps of:      grinding the plant material; washing the ground plant material with alcohol; and extracting nucleic acid from the alcohol wash. In this aspect of the invention, preferably the plant material is plant seed.  Preferably the plant material is roughly ground. Preferably the alcohol is ethanol, more preferably 100% ethanol. Preferably the ground plant material is washed multiple times, for example two times with alcohol. Preferably the nucleic acid is DNA. Applicants have surprisingly found that it is possible to reduce the amount of plant nucleic acid, e.g. plant seed nucleic acid and/or enrich for nucleic acid from endophytic strains by roughly grinding the plant tissue, e.g. seed, and then washing this in alcohol, preferably ethanol. While applicants do not wish to be restricted by theory, it is thought that the alcohol acts to preserve the microbe component of the plant material, particularly seed.  Extracting nucleic acid, e.g. DNA from the alcohol, e.g. ethanol, wash reduces the amount of host plant nucleic acid and enriches for microbe nucleic acid. This overcomes or at least alleviates the problem of one or more prior art methods, including those which generate large numbers of sequence reads to capture the microbial component or use differences in nucleic acid, e.g. DNA methlylation density to distinguish between host and microbial nucleic acid. In a preferred embodiment, universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for profiling bacterial microbiome and/or fungal microbiome may be used to generate the sequence data. For example, primers directed to the 16S rDNA gene, more particularly the V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene, may be used for profiling bacterial microbiome. For example, primers directed to the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA  genes, more particularly the IT52 region of rDNA genes, may be used for profiling fungal microbiome.  
 6 In one embodiment, bacterial sequence data is produced using universal primers directed to the V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene and the fungal sequence data is produced using universal primers directed to the ITS2 region of the rDNA genes. Metagenomic sequence data may be assembled to create the bacterial and/or fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Preferably, the metagenomic sequence data may be quality trimmed and then paired using a paired-end assembler for sequences, such as PAN DAseq, to create the bacterial and/or fungal OTUs. The OTUs may be aligned against a bacterial database, such as the GreenGenes bacterial database, and/or a fungal database, such as the UNITE fungal database, to assign taxonomy. The number of sequences associated with OTUs may be calculated for each sample. By comparing the OTUs present in each sample species, core, supplemental and unique microbiomes may be identified. By a 'microbiome' is meant the collective genomes of the bacteria and/or fungi. By a 'core microbiome' is meant OTUs that are found across all or substantially all Brachiaria-Urochloa species tested. By a 'supplemental microbiome' is meant OTUs that are found across a subset of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species tested. By a 'unique microbiome' is meant OTUs associated with specific Brachiaria-Urochloa species. Endophytes having a desired core, supplemental or unique microbiome may then be selected. For example, endophytes with a broad host range may be selected as candidates for delivery of traits into plants of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex.  For example, endophytes with a narrow or specific host range may be selected as candidates for specific traits of interest, for example for production of compounds that provide beneficial properties such as improved tolerance to water and/or nutrient stress, or improved resistance to pests and/or diseases in the plant with which the endophyte is associated. In a preferred embodiment, the beneficial properties include insecticidal or insect repellent activity. In a further preferred embodiment, the improved resistance to pests and/or diseases includes antifungal activity. In a particularly preferred embodiment the compound may be an inhibitory compound, such as a nitrification inhibitor, for example a fusicoccane such as brachialactone.

Preferably, the endophyte is at least approximately 90% pure, more preferably at least approximately 95% pure, even more preferably at least approximately 98% pure, even more preferably at least approximately 99%  pure. Preferably the endophyte is in axenic culture. The term 'isolated' means that the endophyte is removed from its original environment (e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally occurring endophyte present in a living plant is not isolated, but the same endophyte separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. In its natural environment, the endophyte may live mutualistically within a plant. Alternatively, the endophyte may be an epiphyte, i.e. grow attached to or upon a plant. The endophyte may be a fungal endophyte or a bacterial endophyte.

The grain crop or industrial crop grass may be those belonging to the genus Triticum, including T. aestivum (wheat), those belonging to the genus Hordeum, including H. vulgare (barley), those belonging to the genus Zea, including Z. mays (maize or corn), those belonging to the genus Otyza, including 0. sativa (rice), those belonging to the genus Saccharum including S. officinarum (sugarcane), those belonging to the genus Sorghum including S. bicolor (sorghum), those belonging to the genus Panicum, including P. virgatum (switchgrass), and those belonging to the genera Miscanthus, Paspalum, Pennisetum, Poa, Era grostis and Agrostis. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of inoculating a plant of the Brachiaria-Urochoa species complex with one or more endophytes, said method including providing sterilised seed of the plant of the Brachiaria-Urochoa species complex; germinating the seed under aseptic conditions to produce host plants that are substantially free of microbial organisms; inoculating the host plants with the one or more endophytes. While Applicant does not wish to be restricted by theory, it is thought that conducting the method of the present invention under aseptic conditions ensures endophytes are inoculated into host plants that are substantially free of microbial organisms, thereby facilitating a high frequency of successful inoculation. Further, it is thought that the use of different media prior to inoculation to allow the host plant to establish, such as root growth promoting media, also facilitates high inoculation frequency.              The use of a sterile environment also enables analysis of the microbiome without contamination. For example the inoculation frequency may be between approximately 25% and approximately 100%, more preferably between approximately 50% and approximately 100%, even more preferably between approximately 75% and approximately 100%.  The inoculation frequency may be higher than conventional methods.  
 17 Preferably, the plant of the Brachiaria-Urochoa species complex is of a species as hereinbefore described. Preferably said one or more endophytes are selected from the endophytes as hereinbefore described. The one or more endophytes may be bacterial or fungal or a mixture thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the step of germinating the seed under aseptic conditions to produce host plants may include growing the germinated seed on shoot multiplication medium such as M3B and root multiplication medium such as MS+NAA. Preferably, the germinated seed may be grown on shoot multiplication medium, splitting the resulting shoots into single tillers and then transferring them to root multiplication medium. The single tillers may be grown on the root multiplication medium for approximately 1 to approximately 6 weeks, more preferably approximately 2 to approximately 3 weeks, to promote root growth. The resulting plantlets may again be split into single tillers for endophyte inoculation. In a preferred embodiment, the step of inoculating the host plants with the one or more endophytes may include removal of the outer sheath to reveal shoot initial, creation of a wound in the shoot meristem and inoculation into the wound. In a preferred embodiment, the method may include the further step of retaining the plantlets on sterile media following inoculation, preferably for a period of approximately 1 to approximately 6 weeks, more preferably approximately 2 to approximately 3 weeks. In a preferred embodiment, the method may include the still further step of transferring the inoculated plants thus produced to soil or similar medium for further growth, for example under glasshouse conditions. The present invention will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying Examples and drawings. It should be understood, however, that the description following is illustrative only and should not be taken in any way as a restriction on the generality of the invention described above.  
 18 Brief Description of the Drawings/Figures Figure 1 shows the incidence of endophyte isolates in brachiaria species based on rDNA  sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 18S coding regions.  Brachiaria endophyte isolates are genetically diverse, representing at least 10 distinct taxonomic groups. Figure 2 shows a bootstrap consensus tree generated through neighbour-joining analysis of the ITS region from fungal endophyte isolates derived from Brachiaria-Urochloa accessions (left hand side) and the identification of the presence/absence of selected isolated and culturable fungal endophyte strains in the microbiomes of 5 Brachiaria-Urochloa species (right hand side) (Bb- B. brizantha; Bh ¨ B. humidicola; Bd ¨ B. decumbens; Um ¨  U.mosambicensis; Br ¨ B. ruziensis) based on the ITS sequence.      Figure 2A is an enlarged bootstrap consensus tree of Figure 2. Figure 3 shows an LC(ESI)-MS mass spectra identifying brachialactone, displaying extracted ion chromatogram at RT: 8.91-8.98 minutes. Figure 4 shows MS fragmentation brachialactone fragments (333.2059, 315.1964, 271.2068) at RT 8.93 minutes of the LC(ESI)-MS mass spectra of Figure 3.

Detailed Description of the Embodiments Example 1 ¨ Endophytic microbial profile of Brachiaria-Urochloa species The endophytic microbiomes of five Brachiaria-Urochloa species were profiled using metagenomics. Species included B. brizantha, B. humidicola, B. ruziziensis, B.  decumbens and U. mosambicensis. A total of three plants were profiled per species. Three organs were profiled from each plant (roots, stem and leaves). A total of two replicates were prepared per organ, per plant. Plant material (approximately 100 mg) was surface sterilised by soaking in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, followed by 4.2% Na0C1 (bleach) for 2 minutes, and then rinsed three to five times in sterile MilliQ water to ensure the sterilant had been completely removed. Samples were freeze-dried for 48 hours at -58  C and 0.014 mBar. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy plant mini kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Endophytic bacteria and fungi were evaluated in the metagenomics analyses using the universal PCR primers 515f and 806r for profiling the bacterial microbiome (V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene, approx. 350 base pairs), and 58A2F and IT54 for the fungal microbiome (IT52 region of the rDNA genes, approx. 400 base pairs), with associated IIlumina adapters. Paired end libraries were prepared and loaded according to the corresponding IIlumina user guide. Metagenomic sequence data was quality trimmed and paired using PANDSEQ to create operational taxonomic units (OTU), which were aligned against the GreenGenes bacterial database and the UNITE fungal database to assign taxonomy (OTU: 97% sequence identity, e-value < 10e-110). The number of sequences associated with OTUs was calculated across all samples, and normalised as a percentage. Total microbial diversity across Brachiaria-Urochloa A total of 361 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified across all Brachiaria-Urochloa species, comprising 25 bacterial Phyla, 56 Classes, 121 Families and 170 Genera (including candidate taxonomic groups) (Table 1). The analyses identified the core microbiome (OTUs found across all Brachiaria-Urochloa species) and the unique microbiome (OTUs associated with specific Brachiaria-Urochloa species), along with bacterial OTUs only associated with Brachiaria-Urochloa species known to produce brachialactone (B. humidicola and B. ruziziensis) (Table 1). The analyses also provided 5    cross validation of the presence of endophytes isolated from these Brachiaria-Urochloa species. In addition, 84 fungal OTUs were identified, comprising 5 Phyla, 14 Classes, 32 Families and 44 Genera (Table 2). The analyses identified the core microbiome (OTUs found across 10    all Brachiaria-Urochloa species) and the unique microbiome (OTUs associated with specific Brachiaria-Urochloa species), along with fungal OTUs only associated with Brachiaria-Urochloa species known to produce brachialactone (B. humidicola and B.  ruziziensis) (Table 2). The analyses also provide cross validation of the presence of endophytes isolated from these Brachiaria-Urochloa species. Table 1: Endophytic bacterial OTUs found within the leaves, root and stem of five Brachiaria-Urochloa species (361 OTUs), including identification of the core microbiome, the unique microbiome, and bacterial OTUs only associated with Brachiaria-Urochloa species known to produce brachialactone (Brach ¨ B. humidicola and B.  ruziziensis). Examples of the bacterial microbial diversity in Brachiaria-Urochloa species is represented within B. humidicola (Bh) and B. decumbens (Bd).

greatest in the roots of Brachiaria-Urochloa species accounting for 359 bacterial species (99.4%) and 83 fungal species (98.8%) (Tables 1 and 2).  The microbial diversity in the stem and leaf was significantly lower than the roots, accounting for 5 ¨ 20 bacterial or fungal OTUs. Microbial diversity across Brachiaria-Urochloa species The core microbiome consisted of 130 bacterial OTUs and 14 fungal OTUs (Tables 1 ,2, and 3). The core bacterial microbiome contained a diverse array of taxa, while the core fungal microbiome predominantly contained Sordariomycetes species (8). The OTUs associated with the core microbiome were also the most abundant OTUs across all Brachiaria-Urochloa species. The number of OTUs unique to Brachiaria-Urochloa species ranged from 5 to 27 for bacteria and 2 to 12 for fungi, and were predominantly found in low abundance in their respective species.

B. humidicola had the highest fungal diversity, approximately 15% higher than any other Brachiaria-Urochloa species. Conversely, B. humidicola had the second lowest bacterial diversity, approximately 31% lower than B. decumbens (highest bacterial diversity). As with all other Brachiaria-Urochloa species the greatest microbial diversity was observed in the roots, while there was very low microbial diversity in the stems and leaves.     The number of bacterial and fungal OTUs associated with B. decumbens was 276 and 37 respectively. B. decumbens had the highest bacterial diversity, approximately 3 to 33%  higher than any other Brachiaria-Urochloa species. Conversely, B. decumbens had the second lowest fungal diversity, approximately 23% lower than B. humidicola. As with all other Brachiaria-Urochloa species the greatest microbial diversity was observed in the roots, while there was very low microbial diversity in the stems and leaves. The top five fungal and bacterial OTUs associated with both B. humidicola and B.  decumbens show sequence homology to isolates from NCB! that have been predominantly been identified as endophytes, including endophytes of other Poaceae species (e.g. Olyzae sativa, Triticum aestivum), mycorrhizae (e.g. Glomus species) or rhizobacteria (Rhizobiales species). The fungal pathogen Fusarium proliferatum was also present, which is a seed-borne pathogen of a range of agricultural crop species (Tables 4 and 5).

The OTUs associated with brachialactone producing Brachiaria-Urochloa species represent a range of diverse bacterial and fungal taxa.     Example 2 ¨ Metagenome analysis of the brachiaria microbiome determines the host range of fungal endophytes of Brachiaria-Urochloa grasses A total of 97 fungal endophyte isolates derived from 11 Brachiaria-Urochloa species were identified in a global study of 281 accessions from 23 countries. The internal transcribed spacer ITS sequence was used for further characterisation. The entire region of nuclear ribosomal DNA which comprises both internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and IT52 and the 5.8S subunit was PCR-amplified using primers IT55 and IT54 (White et al.  1990). Purified PCR amplification products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing technology.  Isolated subcultured endophytes were then grouped based on ITS sequence identity.  Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 18S coding regions shows that brachiaria endophyte isolates are genetically diverse, representing at least 10 distinct taxonomic groups (Figure 1). B. humidicola and B. ruziziensis species, shown to produce brachialactone, exhibit high levels of fungal endophyte diversity and richness (Figure 1). Sequence data was used in BLASTN analysis to identify matches in the NCB!  database.  Brachiaria endophytes discovered are genetically novel. Comparison of each isolates ITS sequence to those in publically available databases did not identify any fungal strains with >90% identity. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that isolates from different ITS clusters belonged to diverse genera. In several accessions, multiple endophytes isolated from a single plant belonged to different rDNA specific clusters, suggesting co-existence of multiple fungal endophyte species in the same plant (Table 6).

A total of 27 isolates had sequence homology (>10e-145) to OTUs in the metagenomics analysis, further validating their endophytic ecological niche. The isolates had sequence homology to Acremonium sp., Sarocladium strictum, Hypocrea sp., Microsphaeropsis arundinis, an uncultured fungal sp. and Pseudo gymnoascus sp. The pattern observed for the presence of ITS across host species follows within ITS Group similarity. For example, IT55 (for example 2.15.A.2) and ITS1 form single ITS groups (no within group sub-clustering) and appear to be present ubiquitously in Brachiaria-Urochola.    In contrast, ITS7 shows patterns of host presence/absence that is related to the three ITS7 sub-clusters identified [represented by endophyte isolates 2.3Ø1 (cluster 1), 2.10Ø2 (cluster 2), 2.12.B.1 and 2.11.B.1 (cluster 3)]. The IT56 group is genetically diverse, with three distinct clusters.  Endophyte isolate 2.2.A.1 was detected in only 1 of 5 host species tested, while 2.10.D.1 shows a broad host range. The IT52 Group endophytes exhibit two different host profiles.  Endophytes 12.1.B  and 9.2.B show a broad host range, being present in each of the 5 host species tested. In contrast 1.1.A shows a narrow host range, as it was detected in only 1 of 5 host species tested. Variation in host colonisation between putative sub-groups of the same taxonomic group may be an indicator of host-endophyte co-evolution and specialisation. Example 3 ¨ Brachialactone is microbial in origin Mature plants of Bra chiaria-Urochloa grass-endophyte associations that had been maintained in a controlled environment were subjected to metabolic profiling analysis. Four individual plants (biological replicates) from each of three Brachiaria-Urochloa species (B.  humidicola, U. mosambicensis, B. ruziziensis) were analysed for the presence of brachialactone using liquid chromatography¨mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Freeze-dried pseudostem samples were prepared for LC-MS analysis using an 80% methanol extraction procedure. The compound brachialactone was identified in the root tissues of brachiaria-endophyte associations (B. humidicola, B. ruziensis) (Figure 3 to 5; Table 7).  The presence of brachialactone was confirmed through MS (ions extracted at the mass to charge ratio [m/z] of 333.2059 at RT 8.93 minutes). Brachialactone was not detected in B.  decumbens-endophyte associations or U. mosambiciensis-endophyte associations (Table 7).     Table 7: Brachialactone detection in Brachiaria-Urochloa. Samples of B.  humidicola-endophyte and B. ruziziensis-endophyte associations show presence of brachialactone. Brachiaria-Brachialactone Urochloa B. humidicola U. mosambiciensis B. decumbens B. ruziziensis +: brachialactone detected; -: no brachialactone detected Example 4 ¨ An optimised method for inoculation of brachiaria endophytes into Brachiaria-Urochola A host panel comprising commercially relevant Brachiaria-Urochola germplasm was established to enable inoculation of genetically novel and highly diverse endophyte isolates into a single host genotype. An optimised method for endophyte inoculation into host plants free of microbial organisms in axenic conditions was developed, facilitating a high frequency of successful inoculation (Table 8). Four fungal endophytes representing four of the rDNA sequence-defined clades were identified as candidates for inoculation and characterisation into the Brachiaria-Urochola host panel. Sterilised brachiaria seed are germinated under aseptic conditions to remove microbial organisms from the host plants to be used for inoculation. Microbe-free donor plantlets are grown on shoot multiplication media (M3B) under sterile conditions. Donor shoots are split into single tillers and transferred to root multiplication media (MS+NAA).  Single tillers are grown for 2-3 weeks to promote root growth, plantlets are then again split into single tillers and the outer sheath is removed to reveal shoot initial. Shoot initials with intact roots are transferred to water agar for inoculation of endophyte mycelia. For endophyte inoculation, a small cut is made across the shoot meristem, and endophyte is inoculated into the wound. Following inoculation, plantlets are retained on 1/2 MS media for 2 weeks. They are then transferred to soil and grown under glasshouse conditions for 8 weeks before testing for endophyte presence using a diagnostic set of strain specific SSR markers (Figure 6).     Endophyte inoculation frequency was determined for each candidate endophyte, approximately 6 months post inoculation, using a diagnostic (i.e. specific allele sizes at each SSR loci for each endophyte) set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for each endophyte isolate. Successful inoculation was achieved for representative endophytes from each of the ribosomal DNA sequence-defined clades (Table 8). Variation between endophyte isolates representing different ITS groups was observed. IT55 (2.15.A.2) > IT57 (2.10Ø2) > IT52 (12.1.B) > ITS1 (5.1.B). Cross species compatibility was also observed.  Endophyte isolate 2.15.A.2 (58 to 83%) and 2.10Ø2 (38% to 83%) exhibit broad species compatibility compared to the moderately compatible 12.1.B (8 to 76%) and narrow host compatibility of 5.1.B (0 to 7%). As would be expected, each endophyte strain shows highest inoculation frequency for the species from which it was originally isolated. Table 8: Summary of inoculation frequencies (%). Data presented here is for stable Brachiaria-Urochola endophyte associations identified 3 to 6 months post inoculation. A  diagnostic set of SSR markers specific for Brachiaria-Urochola endophytes are used to test for endophyte presence and identity in planta. Shown here is the percentage of endophyte positive plants identified from the total number of plants harvested. Host plant and endophyte averages are shown in columns highlighted in grey. The Brachiaria-Urochola species from which the endophyte was isolated is highlighted in light grey.

U.  mosambicensis forms stable associations with a broad range of fungal endophytes at a very high frequency of successful inoculation (60%). Also of note is that U. mosambicensis forms associations with multiple, highly diverse fungal endophytes (Figure 1; Table 6). Endophyte strains representing 6 of the 7 ITS groups identified in brachiaria were isolated from this species (Figure 1). B. humidicola forms stable associations with a broad range of fungal endophytes at a high frequency of successful inoculation (41%). As for U.  mosambicensis, this species naturally harbours a diversity of multiple endophytes, with 4 of 7 ITS groups identified (Figure 1).   Example 5 - Metagenomics analysis of the Brachiaria-Urochloa seed microbiome A significant challenge in plant microbiome studies is that in order to analyse the endophytic component of a plant microbiome, it is necessary to extract DNA from plant tissues. The presence of a high proportion of plant DNA: microbe DNA (in the order of 20:1 for bacteria and 1:1 for fungi) in DNA extracted affects downstream sequence analysis. In previous studies, one way this has been dealt with is to generate large numbers of sequence reads to achieve a target number of microbiome reads. In this example, a method was developed to enrich for the microbiome (both bacterial and fungal DNA) when extracting DNA from plant seed. The method is not limited in application to plant seed, and may be applied to any plant tissue from any species of interest, including leaf, stem and/or root plant material. Seed-associated endophytic microbes are of interest as they may be exploited in a molecular breeding scenario whereby the microbe and host plant are co-selected for a particular trait of interest. Further, the presence of endophytic microbes in both root and seed microbiomes is of particular interest as seed associated microbes that are distributed throughout the plant may be associated with enhanced performance traits, such as pest and disease resistance, or biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) through the production of brachialactone. Variation in host seed colonisation may be an indicator of host-endophyte co-evolution and specialisation Once isolated and purified, individual components of the endophytic seed microbiome can be genome sequenced and characterised for molecular marker development, taxonomic identification and phylogenomic analyses. Selected microbiome component organisms can also be phenotypically assessed singly and in combination to identify microbes that confer enhanced production traits, for example BNI, to a range of commercially significant brachiaria species. There is potential to further exploit the biological properties of the brachiaria microbiome across a broad range of crop species to the benefit of sustainable agriculture and the environment. Example 6 - Methodology for enriching for bacterial and fungal DNA in microbiome 5    analysis of seed. A method was developed to enrich for the microbiome (bacterial and fungal DNA) component in brachiaria seed (Figure 7). Although used for plant seed in this example, the method may also be applied to any plant tissue from any species of interest.  Depending on 10    the plant tissue, the person skilled in the art would understand that small changes may be made to the method to optimise the enrichment of the microbiome, for example the amount of grinding of the plant material may be varied e.g. from finely ground to roughly ground, depending on the nature of the plant material. 15    Fifty grams of seed from each of the ten selected accessions (Table 9) was surface sterilised (5% [w/v] NaHCI and Tween 20) for 30 min with shaking. Seed samples were then rinsed eight to ten times in sterile MilliQ water to ensure the sterilant had been completely removed. Seed were dried on sterile filter paper under aseptic conditions overnight. Dried seeds were partially ground using a genogrinder (SPEX  SamplePrep 2010  
 20    Geno/GrinderR, Metuchen, USA). Ground seeds were then washed twice for 12 hrs with absolute ethanol and continuous shaking. Following washes, samples were allowed to settle and the supernatant containing the seed associated endophytic microbiome collected. The supernatant was then completely evaporated under sterile conditions. DNA  was extracted from the final crude (what was left following ethanol evaporation) using the 25    Qiagen DNeasy plant mini kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Simultaneously, DNA was also extracted from surface sterilised seeds (10 seeds from each accession) using the Qiagen DNeasy plant mini kit according to manufacturer's instructions.  Bacteria and fungi were evaluated in the metagenomics analyses using the universal PCR 30    primers 515f (Wang & Qian, 2009) and 806r (McBain et al, 2003) for profiling the bacterial microbiome (V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene, approx. 350 base pairs), and 58A2F  (Martin & Rygiewicz, 2005) and IT54 (White et al, 1990) for the fungal microbiome (IT52 region of the rDNA genes, approx. 400 base pairs), with associated IIlumina adapters.  Ribosomal RNA gene amplicons were prepared and sequenced on the MiSeq (IIlumina) according to 35    the corresponding user guide.     Table 9: Brachiaria species used in this example.

Brachiaria species examined included three species - B. humidicola, B.  ruziziensis, B.  decumbens - previously documented to produce biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) compounds, and B. brizantha which does not produce BNI compounds (Table 9). The data is then analysed to identify the seed associated endophytic microbiome of brachiaria: =    associated with the production of brachialactone o        specifically with the BNI trait in B. humidicola o in general with the BNI trait (i.e. common to B. humidicola, B. ruziziensis and B. decumbens) =    unique to B. humidicola, B. ruziziensis, B. decumbens or B. brizantha =    in common to all Brachiaria species studied It is to be understood that various alterations, modifications and/or additions may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention as outlined herein.
