Further, the invention concerns the use of such recombinant vectors for the production of reconstituted HCMV virus with the mentioned characteristics as well as the use of reconstituted infectious HCMV virus for the production of vaccines and/or antibodies against the virus. Further embodiments of the invention are the use of reconstituted virus for the screening of drugs, the use of the recombinant vector and/or the reconstituted virus for studying genes and function of genes, as well as other uses. A further subject of the present invention are HCMV virus mutants, in which the region UL130 2o to UL132 is either deleted or mutated in such a way that the ability to induce microfusion events is lost or in which the region UL128 to UL132 is deleted or mutated in such a way that PMNL (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) and/or HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) tropism is reduced or lost. Further embodiments are uses of such virus mutants or 25 transfer of the genetic region UL132-128 of FIX-Bac into fibrobiast adapted laboratory strains of HCMV (for example AD169) to regain PMNL and HUVEC tropism.      HCMV is a leading cause of birth defects when infection is acquired by so HCMV-seronegative women during pregnancy (refs 1,2,3). In addition, HCMV represents one of the major opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised individuals, such as bone marrow and solid organs transplant recipients and patients with primary or acquired (AIDS) immune deficiency. However, the pathogenesis of HCMV infection is not well understood. The main factor affecting research on this topic is recognized in the lack of the possibility of reproducing in vitro aspects of HCMV s infection which are thought to be crucial in vivo. In particular, HCMV has been demonstrated to be able to infect in vivo several tissues and a number of cell types (refs 1,4), providing a wide spectrum of symptomatic diseases and organ localizations in immunocompromised individuals (refs 5,6) or inducing defects in multiple organs during embryogenesis which ~o can be summarized as "congenital HCMV syndrome". In addition, a striking in vivo characteristic of primary HCMV infection in immunocompetent individuals (ref 7) and of active HCMV infection in immunocompromised patients (ref 8), is the presence of infectious virus and viral materials in circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) (refs 9,10). The latter is ~s a major prognostic marker, which is highly predictive of disease progression in immunocompromised patients. Provided that the virus does not appear to fully replicate in PMNL, rather it can actively promote transfer of preformed viral particles to PMNL from productively infected cells by virus-induced microfusion events (ref 1 1 ), HCMV-positive PMNL zo are a powerful vehicle for viral dissemination.     In contrast, currently available HCMV laboratory-adapted reference strains (AD 169, Towne, Davis and Toledo) (refs 12,13) lost phenotypic characteristics thought to be important for pathogenicity "in vivo". 2s Examples of pathogenic characteristics of clinical isolates are: i) preferential cell-to-cell spread, ii) tropism for a broad spectrum of tissues, iii) ability to transfer infectious virus to PMNL. Laboratory-adapted strains lost these biologic characteristics during propagation in standard cell culture (human embryonic fibroblasts, HEF). In addition, reference strains show a different so genome organization with respecfi to clinical strains. In tact, clinical strains have 13.5 kb of additional genome sequence which present a particular orientation in clinical strains. Moreover, due to the intrinsic slow HCMV  
  replication in cell culture, the generation of mutants for studying different phenotypic characteristics is extremely cumbersome and time consuming.      Consequently, it was the object of the present invention to provide a s possibility to in vitro produce HCMV virus that still retains the pathogenic characteristics of clinical isolates. Further objects of the invention are to provide vecfiors containing the viral genome that allow to mutagenize the viral genome for e.g. studying the function of specific regions of the genome or to provide for mutated virus that can be used e.g. for vaccine ~o production.      These objects are solved by the present invention as described in the following: 15 A first subject of the present invention is a recombinant vector containing DNA sequences of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and being useful for the production of reconstituted HCMV virus retaining phenotypic characteristics of a clinical virus isolate including the ability to grow on endothelial cells. and to induce microfusion events, such recombinant 2o vector being characterized in that it is obtainable by inserting the infectious genome from a clinical isolate of HCMV virus into a bacterial cloning vehicle.      Within the context of the present invention it has been observed that low z5 passage clinical isolates retained both the broad cell tropism observed in vivo and the capability to transfer virus via microfusion to PMNL (ref 11 ). The invention is based on the surprising finding that cloning clinical isolates of HCMV virus in the so-called BAC system (W099/06582) provides for the first time the possibility to in vitro produce HCMV virus that shows at ao least the most important characteristics of HCMV virus. These are above all the ability to grow on endothelial cells and to induce microfusion events to promote transfer of viral particles between cells. From the standpoint of the present knowledge about HCMV infection, these two characteristics seem to be most important for the infectivity of wild-type virus. Especially the use of the BAC system opens the possibility of propagation of stable HCMV genetic material in a heterologous biological system as e.g. E.coli. s In particular, the accumulation of mutations during the HEF adaption procedure, which is ultimately responsible for the loss of broad tissue tropism by presently available reference laboratory adapted strains, is avoided. Thus, a recombinant vector according to the present invention provides the possibility to in vitro produce a new reference strain for ~o genetic analysis of HCMV strains circulating in vivo. The vector according to the present invention provides a genetic background encoding phenotypic characteristics crucial for HCMV pathogenesis in vivo.      The recombinant vector according to the invention, apart from providing 15 the possibility to produce infectious virus in vitro, also represents a unique reagent for identifying viral genes and viral gene functions, which are crucial for HCMV pathogenesis. In fact, it retains the complete gene structure of HCMV strains present in vivo and virus produced therefrom retains key known pathogenetic characteristics, namely endothelial cell 2o tropism and microfusion phenotype and most likely others like Nk-cell resistance and infection of broncho-epithelial cells and chondrocytes as well as dendritic cells, monocytes and/or macrophages. Maintainance and replication of the recombinant vector including the viral genome is dissociated from replication of the virus in cell culture, but is preserved by as replication of the viral DNA in the bacterial system. This provides a solution to obtaining standard genetic material for biological studies.      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the recombinant vector contains the complete infectious genome of HCMV and lacks only genes so US2-US6 which are not required for virus replication nor for HUVEC or I'MNL tropism. However, it is also possible to produce mutants that lack at least part of the DNA or contain substitutions in the DNA. In this way, virus mutants can be produced specifically by deleting or substituting parts of the DNA. This allows to study and map the gene functions of HCMV easily. In principle any bacterial cloning system can be used to insert HCMV DNA, as long as it retains the ability for DNA replication in suitable s host cells and is able to coreplicate the viral DNA. It is preferred to use cloning vehicles that are present with a low copy number in the host cell to achieve better stability of the viral sequences in the recombinant vector.      In a further preferred embodiment the recombinant vector according to the ~o invention is produced using a bacterial cloning vehicle that contains DNA sequences which are homologous to the HCMV DNA and insertion is effected by homologous recombination. In an especially preferred embodiment the bacterial cloning vehicle is a BAC system vector, as described in W099/06582, which is already mentioned above. The ~s disclosure of W099/06582, especially as far as it relates to the preparation of vectors and insertion of viral genome, is herewith incorporated by reference.     An especially preferred recombinant vector is designated FIX-Bac-7 and has 2o been deposited as described in the following. This recombinant vector is especially useful for studying functions of HCMV virus or producing HCMV virus, since it contains an infectious HCMV virus genome with preserved wildtype characteristics stably integrated into a BAC system vector. FIX-Bac=7-vector can be propagated like a normal recombinant vector and does 2s not lose the viral DNA or functions.      A further subject of the present invention is a bacterial culture which contains a recombinant vector according to the invention. Such bacterial culture is able to reproduce recombinant vector and preferably such a so bacterial culture is an E.coli cell line, especially E.coli DH108. In a most preferred embodiment such bacterial culture according to the invention contains at least one copy of FiX-Bac-7, and is designated FIX-Bac-7-E.coli DH 1 OB. This cell line has been deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen GmbH-DSZM as DSM 13958 on December 14, 2000.      Further subjects of the present invention are uses of the recombinant vector according to the invention. One preferred use is the production of reconstituted HCMV virus retaining the phenotypic characteristics of a parental clinical isolate including the ability to grow on endothelial cells and to induce microfusion. ~o As described above, these two characteristics are considered as being most important for retaining the infectivity of wild-type HCMV. However, it is to be understood that within the context of the present invention also other characteristics of wild-type virus may be conserved during the production as described in claim. Especially features like HUVEC- and/or PMNL-tropism are also considered important and are preferably retained by the HCMV virus which is reconstituted according to the present invention.    For the production of reconstituted HCMV virus it is preferred to transfect 2o the recombinant vector into a suitable eukaryotic host cell and collect the reconstituted infectious virus after culturing of the cells. A suitable eukaryotic host cell is a permissive cell which allows the virus to replicate and virus particles being formed. The reconstituted infectious HCMV virus obtained according to the present invention can e.g. be used for the production of vaccines and/or antibodies. It can also be used for the screening of drugs for their antiviral activity as well as generally for other potential uses of virus. Such uses are further subjects of the present invention. It has been observed that in some cases the packaging of the so virus particles is impaired, obviously due to the presence of vector sequences in addition to virus genome. In such a case it is preferred to remove the sequences of the cloning vehicle from the recombinant vector prior to replication and packaging. In such embodiment it is further preferred to use a cloning vehicle that contains flanking sequences which are homologous to sequences of the virus to allow the removal of at least part of the cloning vehicle by homologous recombination or to flank the Bac vector with IoxP sites for removal with cre recombinase. For virus production from the recombinant vector it is again referred to W099/06582 describing such methods in principle.     Still further subjects of the present invention are the use of recombinant ~o vectors according to the present invention for vaccine development and/or for the development and/or screening of substances which inhibit viral gene production on transcriptional and/or translational level.    The concept of prophylactic vaccination using live attenuated viral strains led in the early 70ies to the generation of the Towne strain, after extensive passaging ( > 135 passages) of a clinical isolate of fibroblast culture. This live vaccine, when administered to humans, proved to be ineffective at protecting individuals from HCMV infections (refs 14-20). Strikingly, infection with vaccinal strain could raise antibody titers as well as cellular zo response. However, these responses were not protective. Today it is known that the Towne strain lost large genomic regions during fibroblast adaption. Other approaches include subunit vaccines again targeting gene products identified and characterized in attenuated strains. Finally, the generation of chimeric viruses using the Towne strain and a low passage 2s isolate (Toledo) has been proposed (refs 12,13), however, both Towne and Toledo lack key characteristics associated with HCMV pathogenesis in vivo. In particular, they lack both endothelial cell tropism and the microfusion phenotype. Thus, using such a vaccine it was not possible to raise an efficient immunologic response against these important viral ao encoded functions.     _g_ The identification of genetic determinants for tissue tropism and body dissemination will lead to the design of better prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. In this respect, the identification of the genetic determinants for endothelial cell tropism and for transfer of virus from productively infected cells to PMNL appear of particular importance. in fact, it is known that during active HCMV infection in immunocompromised patients endothelial cells are productively infected, while it is thought that endothelium might be the major reservoir for latent HCMV infection (refs 1,21-28). Finally, the importance of HCMV infected PMNL in viral dissemination is highlighted by ~o (i) the possibility to detect such cells in immunocompetent persons only during primary infection, (ii) relation to viral transmission of HCMV to the fetus in pregnant women (refs 2,3,7,29) and (iii) the tight correlation between the number of HCMV infected PMNL and the severity of clinical symptoms (ref 30). It is therefore evident that production of vaccines by ~5 using either the recombinant vector according to the invention or reconstituted infectious HCMV virus that is produced according to the invention opens the possibility to raise vaccines that not only raise antibodies but also protect the patient against HCMV infections and its consequences.   For drug discovery as well as for vaccine production, determinants for viral pathogenicity will be obvious targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. The generation of target specific antiviral drugs can be achieved in different ways: 1. The identification of gene products responsible for crucial biological functions (tropism for particular cell types, microfusion) might lead to the reconstruction of biochemical systems for screening of large collections of compounds; helpful will also be a random transposon mutagenesis of FIX so Bac-7 and reconstitution of mutants from transposon libraries.     _g_ 2. Peptides or small molecules interfering with protein-protein interactions can be synthesized by available computer-assisted chemical modelling; 3. Inhibition of viral gene product synthesis can be achieved by s interference at transcriptional or translational level using established gene therapy approaches.      Therefore also the use of a recombinant vector or a reconstituted HCMV virus for the development and/or screening of substances which inhibit ~o viral gene production on transcriptional and/or translational level are preferred embodiments of the present invention.   Within the investigational work of the present invention it has further been established that the region UL130 to UL132 of HCMV virus is responsible 15 for the ability of the virus to induce microfusion events in PMNL and HUVEC tropism. Hence, a virus mutant which is deleted or mutated in this region of the viral genome in such a way that the ability to induce microfusion or HUVEC tropism is lost, is a further subject of the present invention. Such virus can easily be produced using the recombinant vector zo according to the present invention and deleting or mutating the mentioned region by methods that are known to the man in the art (see also Example 5). It is especially preferred to completely delete this region, however, partially deleting or mutating the region is also possible as long as the resulting mutant does not show microfusion induction or HUVEC tropism. zs Using the recombinant vector according to the present invention, it will be easily possible for the man in the art to track down the minimal mutation or deletion that is necessary to prevent induction of microfusion events or HUVEC tropism of a respective HCMV mutant. so It has further been established that the region UL128 to UL132 of HCMV virus is responsible for PMNL andlor HUVEC tropism. The genetic region spanning UL131 to UL128 seems to confer PMNL tropism, whereas HUVEC tropism is encoded within the genetic region of UL132 to UL128 genes. Mutants that contain deletions or mutations within this UL128 to UL132 region of HCMV virus are therefore another preferred embodiment of the present invention, Also for these mutants it is either possible to delete the complete region or to just partially delete or mutate the region and thereby reduce or prevent PMNL and/or HUVEC tropism.      Such HCMV virus mutants in comparison with RV-FIX-7 can advantageously be used for studying pathogenicity and its genetic basis. ~o Especially studying interaction of adherent cells with wild-type virus in comparison with mutant virus will reveal further mechanisms of infection by HCMV virus. Such use of the mutants and RV-FIX-7 therefore are a further preferred embodiment of the present invention. The HCMV virus mutants which affect the genetic region UL132-128 of the invention, lacking the ability to induce microfusion, also have lost the ability to grow on endothelial cells. The cell tropism of this mutant is also changed. The virus mutant seems to indicate a potentially novel mechanism of HCMV infection by a cell to cell infection pathway not through the natural receptor but through cell fusion events. Thus, avoiding the need to exit the 2o cell for reinfection, but rather spreading genetic material from cell to cell through a plasma bridge. Also these mutants and RV-FIX-7 are targets for the development of vaccines and/or antibodies or the design of small molecules and peptides. Such vaccines and antibodies will provide at least some protection against HCMV virus infection.      Further possible uses of the HCMV virus mutants and RV-FIX-7 according to the invention are use in diagnostics, for drug screening, as attenuation marker, for the development of modified vectors, for the development of peptides or antisense genes or antisense RNA, which block the activity of so the microfusion gene and wild-type virus and/or for the screening for such peptides, antisense genes or antisense RNA. A still further use is the studying of innate as well as adapted immune surveillance and immune counterstrategies as e.g. NK-cell resistance of virally infected target cells, cytotoxic and helper T-cell recognition, impact of tissue tropism on HCMV latency and reactivation. Also studying the impact on classic (HLA-A,B,C) and non classic (HLA-E, HLA-G, MIC A/B) MHC regulation on infected target cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, trophoblasts, bronchoepithelial cells, smooth muscle cells) as well as induction or prevention of apoptosis and cell suicide.      Such applications and uses will be well aware to the man in the art upon ~o reading the disclosure of the present invention. Providing a stable system for in vitro production of infectious HCMV virus, tracking down the microfusion gene in the viral region UL131 to UL128 and the HUVEC cell tropism region between UL128 and UL132 as well as the provision of the possibility to easily produce virus mutants allow for the first time to study ~5 infectious HCMV virus activities and properties with a standardized virus strain, and the thus provided possibility to mutate in vitro a virus that corresponds to a clinical isolate opens tremendous possiblities for studying functions and ways of infections and their consequences for the infected person.   The possibility to produce infectious virus as well as mutants of infectious virus or antigens contained in the genome of the infectious virus opens new outlooks for vaccine development and drug design as well as drug screening.      The examples of the present invention contain disclosure on several different mutants and transcriptional analyses that were used to track down the genetic regions responsible for microfusion as well as cell tropism. These mutants are especially preferred mutants according to the so present invention and are further subjects of the present invention.     The present invention will be further explained by the following example and figures:  Ficture 1 A-E:      HUVECs were infected with low MOI (1A-B) or high MOI (1C-D) with either clinical wild-type isolate VR1814 (1A-C) or bac-cloned and reconstituted virus RV-FIX-7 (1 B-D). Staining was done with an ie1 /2 mab as primary antibody and an anti-mouse peroxidase labelled mab as secondary antibody ~o (1 A-D). VR1814 (1 E) or RV-FIX-7 (1 F) infected HUVECs were cocultivated with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) and the lower matrix phosphoprotein (pp65) was detected in the nuclei of PMNL by indirect immunofluorescence. Figures 1 E-F demonstrate that RV-FIX-7 (1 F) retained the capability to infect HUVECs and induce microfusion as ~s compared to WT virus VR1814 (1 E).      The pp65 staining was performed as described in Journal of Microbiology 36, 3585-3589, 1998.

The restriction cut and subsequent Southern Blot analyses confirmed the 2s correct integration of the gpt-bac cassette between US1 and US7. In the EcoRl restriction cut a 5.9 kb band arises due to the integration of the gpt-Bac cassette. An "a" sequence polymorphism could also be confirmed which arises due to a shuffling of "a" sequences at the internal and terminal repeats during the replication of HCMV. so M: molecular weight marker 1 kb ladder.

A novel band at around 6.5 kb arises in both mutant clones in the Hindlll restriction cut.      An additional band at around 4.7 kb arises in the D-ULB' clones in the Hindlll cut as compared to the parallel clone FIX-Bac-7.

Example 1: Characterization of VR1814 s HCMV virus strain VR1814 was isolated from cervical secretions and passacted in HEF 43 times. Before BAC cloning, VR 1814 was cultured in HUVEC for 2 months. HUVEC (human umbelical vein endothelial cell)-tropism and PMNL-tropism of VR1814 were determined by: i) propagating VR1814 in primary HUVEC cultures (Revello et al,, J. Gen. Virol., ~o submitted) and ii) coculturing purified PMNL with HUVEC infected with VR1814, following by immunologic staining of positive PMNL (Revello, J.      Clin. Invest. 1998; Gerna et al.)(Fig. 1A-E).      Example 2: Cloning of the clinical HCMV isolate VR1814 as FIX (fusion is inducing factor X)-Bac (bacterial artificial chromosome) in E.coli.  Generation of the FIX recombinant containing the bac vector, The HCMV recombinant virus was generated by homologous recombination in cell culture. The plasmid pEB 1997 (Borst et al., J. Virol 73, 8320-8329, 20 1999) was linearized with the restriction enzyme Xcml. pEB1997 contains a tk-gpt-bac-cassette flanked with HCMV homologous sequences of US1-US2 (nt 192648 to 193360) on the right side and US6-US7 (nt 195705-197398) on the left side of the cassette. HFF cells (human forescin fibroblasts) (1 x 10' cells) were transfected with 35 ,ug of linearized 25 plasmid pEB1997 using a Gene Pulser II (Biorad). Conditions of transfection were 960 ,uF, 220V. Cells were seeded in a T25 tissue culfiure flask and cultured overnight in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. After 24 h the monolayer was washed once with PBS and infected with an MOI 5 (moiety of infection) using the HUVEC grown clinical isolate VR1814 from Example ao 1 for 6 h. Cells were washed after infection and DMEM 5% FCS was added. Cells were cultured for 2 weeks until 100% CPE (cytopathogenic effect) was reached. Infected cells and supernatant were used to infect a new flask of a confluent monolayer of HF cells for 6 hours. Cells were washed carefully with PBS and selection medium was applied containing ( 100 ,UM xanthine and 25 ,uM mycophenolic acid). After 3 weeks when 100% CPE was reached, cells and supernatant were used for two successive rounds of infection and selection in tissue culture.      Example 3: Generation of the FIX-Bac in E.coli After three rounds of selection in tissue culture the cell monolayer was ~o washed with ice cold PBS and cells were lysed in 1 ml TES-buffer (10 mM      Tris CI pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.6% SDS). To obtain circular viral intermediates a modified HIRT extraction was applied. The sticky lysate was poured into a 2 ml eppendorf vial and 0.3 ml 5 M NaCI was added and carefully mixed. After 24 h of incubation at 4°C cellular DNA and proteins ~s was pelleted out by centrifugation at 14.000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing the circular intermediates was phenol/chloroform extracted once and subsequently precipitated in 2 1l2 volumes of 95% ethanol and 0.1 x 3 M Na-actetate (pH 5.2) for 24 h at -20°C. DNA was pelleted at 14000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min and washed with 70% ethanol. zo The dry DNA pellet was resuspended in 100N1 destilled water and allowed to dissolve for 24 h. Twenty-five ,u1 of viral DNA was electroporated into E.coli DH10B using a Gene Pulser II (Biorad). Conditions were 200 Ohm, 25 ,uF, 2.3 kV. After incubation in LB for 2 hours at 37°C, bacteria were spun for 30 sec at 6000 rpm, resuspended in 100 NI of LB medium and as plated onto agar plates containing chloramphenicol. After 48 h colonies were picked and grown in liquid culture for bacmid preparation as previously described (ref 31). Figure 1 shows the EcoRl and Bgl II restriction pattern of 5 representative clones of FIX-Bac compared to WT-virus. Since the unit long (UL) and unit short (US) region of HCMV can flip ao relatively to each other, two isomeric forms can be observed in E.coli.      Additional polymorphism is added by the number of "a" sequence repeats in the terminal and internal repeat region which vary in individual clones.     Example 4a: Reconstitution of infectious virus from FIX-Bac To recover infectious virus from FIX-Bac clones, DNA was prepared using Nucleobond columns as previously described (ref 31 ). 1 Ng of DNA was s added to 10,u1 Superfecfi (Gibco) and 80,ci1 of RPMI and incubated for 30 min to allow DNA complexes to form. A subconfluenfi layer of MRC-5 fibroblast in a 6 well dish seeded for 24 h was serum starved for 30 min.in RPMI. Medium was completely removed after 30 min and replaced with 1 ml DMEM 5% FCS over 6 well. The DNA transfection mix was diluted with ~0 100 NI of DMEM 5% FCS and added to the cells of a 6 well. After 4 h the transtection mix was removed and 2 ml of fresh DMEM 5% FCS was added per well. After 1 week cells were split into a new flask (T25) and cultured until 100% CPE is achieved. 15 Examale 4b: Phenotypic characterization of reconstitued RV-FIX-Bac-viruses Infectious viruses were reconstitued from transfection of FIX-Bac clones #1, #6, #7, #1 1 and #14 (referred to as RV-FIX-1, RV-FIX-6, RV-FIX-7, 2o RV-FIX-1 1 and RV-FiX-14, respectively) in HEF cells. Reconstituted viruses (RV) were then assayed for HUVEC-tropism and PMNL-tropism as reported.      Ail RV-FIX-Bac derived viruses retained the phenotype observed in the parental VR1814 isolate (Fig. 2). z5 Example 5: Mutation To identify the region in the FIX-Bac-7 genome responsible for microfusion induction and endothelial cell tropism, 13.8 kB of the ULb' region were removed (mutant referred to as Delta-ULb'; primers P-ULb' and P-132) ao using homologous recombination with a linear PCR fragment in a recombination proficient E.coli strain. A second mutant was generated which specifically deleted the beginning of ULb' region namely UL130-132 (referred to as Delta-UL130-13; primers P-132 and P-130) which is inverted in orientation in the clinical isolates as compared to the low passage isolate Toledo. The primers used for generation of the linear PCR fragments with plasmid pAcyc177 (New England Biolabs) as a template were as follows:      P-ULb': 5'-CGC TGT AGG GAT AAA TAG TGC GAT GGC GTT TGT GGG      AGA ACG CAG TAG CGA TGG GTT GCG ACG TGC ACC GAT TTA TTC AAC AAA GCC ACG-3' P-130: 5'-AAC GGC GTC AGG TCT TTG GGA CTC ATG ACG CGC GGT      TTT CAA AAT TCC CTG CGC GCG CGA CGG GCG CCA GTG TTA CAA      CCA ATT AAC C-3' P-132: 5'-AAA CCA CGT CCT CGT CAC ACG TCG TTC GCG GAC ATA      GCA AGA AAT CCA CGT CGC CAC ATC TCG AGA CGA TTT ATT CAA      CAA AGC CAC G-3' The mutant viruses were reconstituted in MRC-5 cells as described under 2o Example 4a. Testing of the Delfia-ULb' and Delta-UL130-132 mutants for capacity to induce microfusion or efficiently infect endothelial cells revelled a loss of both phenotypes. Thus, the genetic region UL130-132 is inducing both microfusion and endothelia! cell tropism and the deletion of the region in the clinical isolate leads to the loss of phenotype described.      A control mutant deleting the region UL45 in the genome of FIX-Bac-7 generated according to the same method (and referred to as Delta-UL45) retained the ability to induce microfusion and grow in endothelial cells.      PCR primers used for generation of this mutant were:     P-45.1; 5'-GCC AGT GGT ACC ACT TGA GCA TCC TGG CCA GAA GCA      CGT CGG GCG TCA TCC CCG AGT CAT AGT AGC GAT TTA TTC AAC      AAA GCC ACG-3' s P-45.2; 5'-ACA CAT CGC ACA CAG ACT TTA TAA ACC GTA GTT GTC      GGC GCC ATC TAG ACT CAC TTT ATT GAA AGC CAG TGT TAC AAC      CAA TTA ACC-3' Thus, the capacity to induce microfusion may reflect a novel mechanism of ~o HCMV to spread its genome from cell to cell and infect cells which do not express the as yet elusive natural receptor of HCMV. Consequently, the genetic region UL130-132 is a crucial determinant for tissue tropism and pathogenesis of HCMV. 15 Fig. 3 shows Hindlll and Bglll restriction patterns of the FIX-Bac mutant clones in comparison to the parental clone (FIX-7).      Example 6: 2o As further examples for feasibility of the cloning of clinical isolates of HCMV as bacterial artificial chromosomes in E.coli, the clinical isolates Phoebe, Powers and TB40E were cloned as bacmids according to the method described above. Additionally the vaccine sfirains Towne-long and Towne-short were cloned as bacmids to prove that the method of bac 2s cloning is also feasible for cloning of vaccine strains fo HCMV.      Phoebe-Bac, Powers-Bac and TB40E-Bac were deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSZM), under DSM 14358 (Phoebe-Bac), DSM 14359 (Powers-Bac) and DSM 14360 (TB40E-Bac) . so Analyses of the bacmids are shown in Fig. 4.     Example 7: Generation of FIX-bac-7 mutants A linear PCR fragment was generated using the kanamycin resistance gene from plasmid pAcyc177 (New England Biolabs) as a template. The primers s used for generation of the linear PCR fragments have about 60 by HCMV homolgous sequence on the 5' and 3' ends, respectively, and were designed as follows:      Mutant D-UL130 ~o P-130-for: 5 '- GCG CCA CAC GCC CGG AGC CTC GAG TTC AGC GTG      CGG CTC TTT GCC AAC TAG CCT GCG TCA CGG CGA TTT ATT CAA      CAA AGC-3 ' P-130-rev: 5 '-AAC GGC GTC AGG TCT TTG GGA CTC ATG ACG CGC        CAA CCA ATT AAC C-3 ' Mutant D-UL130K      P-130-for-kons: 5 '-CCC GGA GCC TCG AGT TCA GCG TGC GGC TCT 2o TTG CCA ACT AGC CTG CGT CAC GGG AAA TAA TCG ATT TAT TCA      ACA AAG CCA CG-3 ' P-130-rev: 5 '-AAC GGC GTC AGG TCT TTG GGA CTC ATG ACG CGC      GGT TTT CAA AAT TCC CTG CGC GCG CGA CGG GCG CCA GTG TTA 2s CAA CCA ATT AAC C-3 Mutant D-UL131:      P-131-for: 5 '-TGT CTT TCG GTT CCA ACT CTT TCC CCG CCC CAT CAC      CTC GCC TGT ACT ATG TGT CGA TTT ATT CAA CAA AGC CAC G- 3 ' P-131-rev: 5 '- GCT AGT TGG CAA AGA GCC GCA CGC TGA ACT CGA      GGC TCC GGG CGT GTG GCG GCC AGT GTT ACA ACC AAT TAA CC-3' Mutant D-132 P-132-for: 5 '- AAA CCA CGT CCT CGT CAC ACG TCG TTC GCG GAC      ATA GCA AGA AAT CCA CGT CGC CAC ATC TCG AGA CGA TTT ATT      CAA CAA AGC CAC G-3' P-132-rev: "5 '- ATG AGA CAT CAT ACA CAT AGT ACA GGC GAG GTG      ATG GGG CGG GGA AAG AGT TGG AAC CGA AAG GCC AGT GTT ACA      ACC-3 ' ~o Mutant D-128 P-128-for: 5 '-GCA CCC ATC CCA ATC TCA TCG TTT GAG CCC GTC      GCG CGC GCA GGG AAT TTT GAA AAC CGC GCG TCC GAT TTA TTC      AAC AAA GCC ACG-3 ' ~5 P-128-rev: 5'-TCG CGC GAC ATG AAT TTA GTC GGC GAC AGA AAT      CTC GAA ACG CGT ATT TCG GAC AAA CAC ACA TGC CAG TGT TAC      AAC CAA TTA ACC-3 ' Mutant D-128K ao P-128-for-kons: 5 '-TGC GTT CTG TGG TGC GTC TGG ATC TGT CTC TCG      ACG TTT CTG ATA GCC ATG TTC CAT CGA CGA TTT ATT CAA CAA      AGC CAC G-3 ' P-128-kons2: 5 '- CGG CAC ACA TCC AGC CGT TTG TGT TTC TTA ACG 2s CTC TCC AGG TAC TGA TCC AGG CCC ACG GCC AGT GTT ACA ACC      AAT TAA-3 ' PCR was performed using the plasmid pAcyc177 as a template. FIX-bac-7 mutants were generated in a recombinant proficient E.coli strain by ao transformation of the respective purified PCR product into the FIX-bac-7 containing E.coli strain. The mutant clones were selected on chloramphenicol (12.5,cig/ml) and kanamycin (50,ug/ml) containing agarose plates. Subsequently, individual clones were picked and grown in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (12.5 ,ug/ml) and kanamycin (50,ug/ml). DNA of the resulting bacmid clones was analysed by restriction enzyme analyses and Southern Blot hybridization.      Example 8:      Determination of the PMN- and HUVEC phenotype of the RV-FIX mutants All RV-FlX (reconstituted virus-FIX) mutant viruses were reconstituted from ~o FIX-bac-7 mutant clones as previously described. Phenotypical testing for PMNL tropism and HUVEC tropism was also performed as previously described. Table 1 provides a summary of the virus mutant phenotypes. As a conclusion of phenotypical testing the mutant viruses we confer that PMNL tropism and induction of microfuesion events is encoded within the genetic region spanning UL131-UL128 genes and HUVEC tropism is encoded within the genetic region of UL-132-128 genes. Disruption of the genes UL131-128 abrogates both HUVEC and PMN tropism phenotype and consequently the genetic region between UL131 and UL128 is essentially required for PMNL tropism and induction of microfusion events of clinical 2o HCMV isolates. Additionally UL132 gene is contributing to the HUVEC phenotype of clinical isolates of HCMV. Taken together we have identified a genetic region (UL132-128) within clinical isolates of HCMV which encodes important pathogenicity features of clinical isolates. The same region may also provide important pathogenicity factors for growth of z5 clinical isolates in other cell types like dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, stem cells and may confer the resistance of clinical isolates of HCMV to NK cell recognition by coding for chemokine-like or cytokine-like factors. The genetic region of UL132-128 identified in FIX-bac-7 is therefore an important target for drug design, gene therapy and vaccine so development against HCMV. We expect that the transfer of the UL132-128 genetic region of FIX-bac into the laboratory strain AD169 will confer HUVEC tropism, PMNL tropism and microfusion phenotype characteristics to the fibroblast adapted AD169 laboratory strain or any other virus strain.

Example 9: Transcript mapping and sequencing of the FIX-bac UL/b' region For mapping of the transcripts spanning the UL132-128 region 5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and 3' RACE procedures were s performed using the Clontech SMARTT"" RACE cDNA Amplification kit according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA was generated from RV-FIX infected fibroblasts (M01 0.1 ) at day 7 p.i. using the Qiagen RNA extraction and mRNA purification kits.

PCR products were subsequently cloned into pT-Adv vector using the AdvanTAgeTMPCR Cloning Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturers' guidance. Individual clones were screened for cDNA inserts by DNA preparation and EcoRl restriction cut. Insert containing clones were s sequenced using M 13 sequencing primers. The respective sequences of the 3 ' RACE and 5 ' RACE clones are attached as individual sequencing files: Clones RACE1, 3-4, 3-10, 57-5-2, 57-5, 57-6, 57-7, 72-1-10, 72-2-4, 72-2-17, 72-5, 72-8, 73-8, 74-3, 74-4, 74-5, 74-8, 75-1, 75-3, 75-4, 75-5, 75-17, 76-7, 77-14. ~o A comparison of the FIX-Bac genomic sequence (designated VR) and individual RACE clones is depicted in figure 6: a) Comparison RACE clonel to FIX genomic sequence; b) RACE clone 3-10 to FIX genomic sequence; 15 C) RACE clone 1 to RACE clone 3-10; d) RACE clone 1, 3-10, 75-3, 72-2-4 to FIX genomic sequence (designated VR7); e) RACE clone 1, 3-4, 3-10, 75-3, 57-5-2, 57-5, 57-6, 72-8, 73-8, 74-5, 75-5 to FIX genomic sequence (designated VR7) The genomic sequence of the UL/b' region of a clinical bacmid clone PAN 1 is attached as sequence file (Seq Id No.2). Parts of the genomic sequence of the UL/b' region of FIX7-Bac (Seq Id No. 1), TB40E1-Bac (Seq Id No.3) and TB40-E4-Bac (Seq Id No. 4) were also determined and are attached as 2s sequencing files. In figure 7 the genomic sequences of PAN-Bac, FIX-Bac and TB40E-Bac were compared in a sequence alignment to the published genomic sequence of Toledo (gb:HCU 33331 ) and to each other using DNAman software:      Fast sequence alignment of a) FIX7 - HCU 33331; b) TB40E4 - HCU 33331;     c) PAN 1 - HCU 33331; d) TB40E4 - FIX7; e) TB40E 1 - TB40E4; f) TB40E1 -FIX7; s g) PAN 1 -TB40E4; h) PAN 1 - FIX7.      In summary, our RACE PCR analyses have identified several novel transcripts within the UL132 to UL128 region of FIX-bac. Two transcripts ~o (RACE clone 3-10, RACE clone1 and RACE clone 3'-4) are of particular 'interest. They show that one major transcript of about 2.0 kb is covering the whole UL131-128 region (see figure 6a-c). RACE clone1, RACE clone 3'-4 and RACE clone 3-10 have a ployA tail and are spliced at the 3' end (position 1721 nt to 1845 nt referred to figure 6e). Both, RACE clone 1 ~s and RACE clone 3'-4 have an additional splice at the 5' end (position 331 nt to 440 nt referred to figure 6e). The ATG start codon of these transcripts is at position nt 96 to nt 98 referred to figure 6e). The predicted 5' end of these three transcripts is presumably 10-50 by upstream of the sequenced end of the clones (nt 50 to nt 100 referred to figure 6e). 5' 2o ends of other transcripts in the UL131-128 region are shown in figure 6d-e) and could be mapped to nt 641 in clone 75-5; nt 717 in clone 57-5-2; nt 783 in clone 57-5; nt 438 in clone 74-5; nt 970 in clone 73-8 and nt 1 150 in clone 72-8.      Since it was shown that the genetic region of UL132 to UL128 is the 2s genetic determinant for induction of microfusion, HUVEC and PMN tropism, the identified transcripts running through this region are candidates for therapeutic intervention, drug design, vaccine development, attenuation of virus virulence, spread and antigenicity of the virus, latency and reactivation as well as immunological control of HCMV by immune cells ao (NK cells, T-cells, B-cells, dendritic cells, endothelial cells and monocytes, macrophages, hematopoietic precursors and stem cells). Ectopic transfer of the genetic region UL132-128 of FIX-Bac-7 or the respective identified cDNAs into a fibroblast adapted HCMV virus (for example AD 169) will confer microfusion characteristics, cell to cell spread of virus material, HUVEC and PMNL tropism and possibly other pathogenicity features to the respective virus.
