 The present invention relates to a kind of composition, it comprises at least one biocontrol agent and the specific insecticide of at least one of cooperative effective quantity, the metabolite that what described biocontrol agent was selected from that the mutant with all diagnostic characteristicses of various bacterial strain of specified microorganisms and/or these bacterial strains and/or various bacterial strain produce show to the activity of insect, mite class, nematoda and/or phytopathogen.In addition, the present invention relates to the purposes of said composition and a kind of method of the total damage for reducing plant and plant part. 
 Insecticide or the fungicide of synthesis are often nonspecific, and therefore can act on the biology except target biology, comprise other naturally occurring beneficial organism.Because their chemical property, they also may be poisonous and not biodegradable.Global consumer little by little recognizes the latency environment relevant with residual (particularly in food product) of chemical substance and health problem.This has caused the application of growing minimizing chemistry (namely synthesizing) insecticide or has at least reduced the consumer pressure of its consumption.Thus, need the requirement of management food chain, still realize effective control of insect simultaneously. 
 Another problem occurred together with the insecticide of synthesis or the application of fungicide is that the repetition of insecticide or fungicide and exclusive application often cause the selection of resistant microorganism.Usually, such bacterial strain also has cross tolerance to other active component with identical binding mode.So described reactive compound no longer may prevent and treat pathogene effectively.But the active component with novel mechanism is difficult to develop and is expensive. 
 The risk of the resistance development of pathogene colony and environment and people's health worry have cultivated the interest differentiating the substitute for the synthetic pesticide and fungicide controlling plant disease.The application of biocontrol agent (BCA) is a kind of replacement scheme.But the validity of most of BCA is not in the level identical with fungicide with common insecticides, particularly when severe infections pressure.As a result, known biocontrol agent, their mutant and the metabolite by their generations are not entirely satisfactory, particularly when low rate of application. 
 Thus, continue to need to develop new substituting plant protection product, it at least helps to meet above-mentioned requirements in some field.
