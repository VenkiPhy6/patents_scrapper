 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a novel expression vector for an antiviral protein, more specifically, a recombinant expression vector for Phytolacca antiviral protein isolated from Phytolacca americana L. and a microorganism transformed therewith. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Studies on the antiviral proteins from many different plant species have been carried out, starting from the discovery of pokeweed antiviral protein (or Phytolacca antiviral protein, hereinafter referred to as "PAP") isolated from a crude extract of Phytolacca americana L. (see: Irvin, J. D., Arch. Biochemistry Biophys., 169:522-528 (1975)). In addition to PAP, a few antiviral proteins have been isolated from several plants, e.g., Ricin (from Ricinus communis) (see: Halting, K. C. et al., Nucleic Acid Res., 13:8019-8033 (1985)), Mirabilia antiviral protein ("MAP", from Mirabilia jalapa L.) (see: Kataoka, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266:8426-8430 (1991)) and α-trichosanthin (from Trichosanthes kirilowii) (see: Zhang, X. et al., Nature, 321:477-478 (1986)). Said antiviral proteins have been reported to be ribosome inactivating proteins ("RIPs") having RNA N-glyoosidase activities (see: Endo, Y. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263:8735-8739 (1988)). 
 In general, PAP from Phytolacca americana U is classified as PAP-I, PAP-II and PAP-S that appear in spring leaves, summer leaves, and seeds, respectively; and it is reported that antiserum reactions of these PAPs are different from one another (see: Irvin, J. D. et al., Arch. Biochemistry Biophys., 200:418-425 (1980)). Further, it has been known that ribosomes of Phytolacca americana L. are depurinated by the RNA N-glycosidase activity of PAP. On the other hand, an immunoconjugate of PAP with CD4 or CD19 has been reported to inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type I (see: Jansen, B. et al., Cancer Res., 52:406-412 (1992); Kim Y. W. et al., J. Immunol., 144:1257-1262 (1990)); Myers, D. E. et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 136:221-238 (1991)); in this connection, said PAPs have been proposed to be applicable to the treatment of AIDS. Accordingly, molecular biological studies on the PAPs have been actively carried out, including the nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA of PAP; the elucidation of the precise mechanism of PAP's biological activity; construction of a transgenic plant; and, application to the immunoconjugate preparation. 
 The present inventors first developed a transgenic plant expressing PAP, and patent applications covering said expression vector are pending under the title "Expression vector for Phytolacca antiviral protein and process for preparing transgenic plant transformed thereof" (U.S. Ser. No. 08/049,075; EP appln. No. 93 110 445.9; JP appln. No. 5-128222). However, it is clear that the expression vector of the prior art is simply designed for the purpose of transformation of plants to confer viral resistance, in light of employing the CaMV 35S promoter which is generally used for the expression of plant genes. 
 Accordingly, the expression of PAP gene has been restricted to plants; and, therefore, there is a need in the art for the development of a practical expression vector which produces PAP at high levels in a versatile microorganism. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 In accordance with the present invention, the present inventors, for the first time, developed a recombinant vector which expresses the PAP gene in a microorganism transformed therewith. 
 A primary object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a novel recombinant expression vector containing the PAP gene isolated from a cDNA library of the Phytolacca americana L., which can be expressed in microorganisms with high yield. 
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a microorganism transformed therewith which expresses PAP in large quantities.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 The present inventors developed a recombinant expression vector pMJ12, containing a PAP gene isolated from a cDNA library of Phytolacca americana L., which directs the expression of recombinant PAP in microorganisms transformed therewith. 
 To isolate the PAP gene, the inventors purified total cellular mRNA from leaves of Phytolacca americana L. obtained in Korea and constructed a cDNA library thereof. The PAP gene is selected by an immunoscreening method employing anti-PAP antibody; and, a deletion mutant is prepared from the isolated PAP gene using the Erase-a-Base system (Promega, U.S.A.). The DNA sequence of a cDNA clone containing the PAP gene (See. ID.NO.1 ) is determined by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method (see: Sanger, F., Science, 214:1205-1210 (1981)). 
 For expression of the isolated PAP gene in microorganisms, a commercially available FLAG™ vector (International Biotechnologies Inc., U.S.A.) is employed. Since the isolated PAP gene has a signal peptide, the coding region of mature PAP is amplified by Thermal Cycler™, which employs synthetic N-terminal and C-terminal primers. DNA thus amplified is electroeluted, digested with HindIII, and ligated into FLAG™ to form the recombinant expression vector pMJ12. Said pMJ12 was deposited with the Korean Collection of Culture and Microorganism (KCCM), an International Depository Authority (IDA) on Jun. 30, 1993 as deposition No. KCCM 10037. 
 pMJ12 thus constructed is transformed into competent E. coli HB101, and colonies transformed with pMJ12 are selected. Then, recombinant PAP is induced for 6 hrs, by culturing said colony on LB broth media containing IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside) and ampicillin. After recombinant PAP induction, cells thus cultured are harvested, washed with phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS: 0.01M NaH 2  PO 4 , 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.4) two times; and lysis of the cell pellet is carried out by freezing in a dry ice-methanol bath and thawing at 37° C., repeatedly. Then, the cell lysate is centrifuged, and the supernatant thereof is collected. 10 μl of supernatant thus obtained is fractionated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R, and production of recombinant PAP is determined by Western blot analysis. 
 For the purification of recombinant PAP, said supernatant is loaded on an anti-FLAG MI affinity column and eluted with the PBS solution containing 1.0 mM CaCl 2 . The biological activity of recombinant PAP is determined by an in vitro translation method. 
 The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention. 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 Isolation of the PAP gene from a cDNA library 
 PAP was isolated in accordance with Irvin's method (see: J. D. Irvin, et al., Arch. Biochemistry Biophys., 169:522-528 (1975)). 480 μg of PAP was dissolved in PBS solution and combined with Freund's complete adjuvant at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v), and the mixture thereof was administered to a rabbit (˜3 Kg of body weight) intramuscularly. After 3 weeks, antibody formation was detected in a small amount of blood collected from the rabbit, and 750 μg of PAP was combined with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) for boosting. Plasma was fractionated from blood by centrifugation; and Protein-A agarose column chromatography was employed to isolate antibodies. An immunodiffusion assay and electrophoresis were employed to determine antibody formation and homogeneity of isolated anti-PAP antibody, respectively. Purified anti-PAP antibody was stored at -70° C. and employed to isolate the PAP gene from a cDNA library. 
 To isolate mRNA from the leaves of Phytolacca americana, the leaf tissue was homogenized using liquid nitrogen and, to the homogenate thus prepared was added a buffer solution for total RNA isolation. Centrifugation was carried out to give a supernatant; and total cellular RNA was isolated from the supernatant by LiCI sedimentation. Then, mRNA was isolated from the total RNA using oligo(dT) cellulose column chromatography, and the isolated mRNA was employed for cDNA synthesis. 
 First-strand cDNA was synthesized from template mRNA employing M-MuLV reverse transcriptase; and, second-strand cDNA synthesis by E. coli DNA polymerase followed. Synthesized cDNA was linked to an EcoRI adaptor and subjected to chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 to fractionate DNA fragments in accordance with the molecular size of the cDNA. Fractionated cDNA was ligated into the Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene Co., U.K.), and in vitro packaging using a packaging extract followed. 
 Immunoscreening employing anti-PAP antibody was carried out to isolate the PAP gene from the cDNA library thus prepared. E. coli SURE was infected with phage to form plaques (2×10 4  pfu). Said bacteria were incubated at 37° C. for 15 min, and further cultured at 42° C. for 3.5 hours after plating with 3 ml of top agarose. Then, the plate was covered with Hybond-N+(Amersham) and incubated for 5 hours. After incubation, the Hybond-N+ was blocked with bovine serum albumin and treated with 5 mg/ml of anti-PAP antibody. After the removal of unbound anti-PAP antibody, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was reacted with the anti-PAP antibody; and, antigen-antibody complexes thus formed were detected by chloronaphthol treatment. 
 A secondary immunoscreening procedure was performed with 15 clones obtained from the primary immunoscreening, in a similar fashion as above with the exception that 5×10 3  pfu were screened. A tertiary immunoscreening procedure was performed with the clones obtained from the secondary immunoscreening, and 8 positive plaques Isolated by the tertiary screen were subjected to the following experiment. 
 To transfer phagemids of 8 recombinant Uni-Zap XR phages, an in vivo excision technique employing R408 helper phage was carried out. Phagemids were isolated from 4 colonies by an alkali denaturation method (see: Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, pp 368-369, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1982)), and colonies harboring the PAP cDNA insert were screened by a restriction enzyme excision method. 
 Of the clones thus screened, plasmids from 2 clones were isolated, and the PAP cDNA inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. To determine the full nucleotide sequence of the PAP gene, DNA was purified from microorganisms harboring the PAP gene. DNA thus purified was digested with SacII and BamHI, and deletions were made by an intermittent ExoIII excision reaction using the Erase-a-Base system (Promega, U.S.A.). The deleted DNAs were ligated to each other by T 4  DNA ligase, and the resultant plasmids were transformed into competent XL1-BLUE cell prepared by CaCl 2  treatment. Deletion mutants fractionated by molecular size were employed to determine the DNA sequence. 
 After preparation of single-stranded DNA by the alkali denaturation method, the full DNA sequence of the PAP gene was determined by SEQUENASE VERSION 2.0 (United States Biochemical, U.S.A.) employing a primer such as the T 7  promoter primer or the universal reverse primer. As described in FIG. 1, PAP cDNA comprises 1195 bp containing a single open reading frame (SEQ. ID. NO. 1). The cDNA insert of PAP encodes 313 amino acid residues, 22 residues of which function as a signal peptide. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Preparation of expression vector pMJ12 
 For the expression of the PAP gene in E. coli HB101, the commercially available FLAG™ vector (International Biotechnologies Inc., U.S.A.) was employed. Primers such as 5'-CCAAGCTTGTGAATACAATCAAC-3' SEQ. ID. No. 2 and 5'-GGAAGCTTTGATCAGAATCCTTCAAA-3' SEQ. ID. NO. 3) synthesized by a DNA Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., U.S.A.) were employed as the N-terminal primer and C-terminal primer, respectively; and the mature PAP gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent™ DNA polymerase (New England Biolab., U.S.A.). In this connection, denaturation (95° C., 30 sec), annealing (55° C., 30 sec) and extension (72° C., 30 sec) were carried out for 30 cycles by a DNA Thermal Cycler (Cetus/Perkin-Elmer, U.S.A.). The PAP gene thus amplified was cleaved with HindIII, and the expression vector of the invention was constructed by ligating the HindIII-cleaved PAP gene with HindIII-cleaved FLAG™ vector with the aid of T 4  DNA ligase. The expression vector thus constructed was named pMJ12 and claimed in the invention. 
 The process for stepwise construction of pMJ12 is depicted in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, S, E, X and K are employed to mean SacI, EcoRI, XhoI and KpnI restriction enzymes, respectively; and, () indicates the signal peptide. pMJ12 thus constructed was transformed into competent E. coli HB101 prepared by CaCl treatment; and, transformants harboring pMJ12 were selected on LB media containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin, based on the plasmid DNA isolation technique employing alkaline lysis. E. coli HB101 thus transformed was claimed in the invention and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (KCCM), an International Depository Authority (IDA) on Jun. 30, 1993, as deposition No. KCCM 10037. 
 FIG. 3 is a photograph showing a 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis pattern of pMJ12 digested with HindIII. In FIG. 3, M is a molecular marker lane, i.e., λDNA fragments digested with HindIII, and the pMJ12 lane shows the expression vector pMJ12 of the present invention. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 Growth inhibition of microorganism transformed with pMJ12 
 Ricin, a ribosome inactivating protein (RIP), has been reported to have no effect on the growth of host microorganisms, while expression of the MAP gene inhibits the growth of its transformant. Whether recombinant PAP produced from the expression vector pMJ12 inhibits growth of the transformant or not was studied through investigation of the cell growth pattern of the host organism. Non-transformed E. coli HB101 and E. coli HBIOI transformed with pFLAG or pMJ12 were inoculated on LB liquid media containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin, and incubated overnight. Then, each culture of the same cell concentration was pipetted, inoculated on LB liquid media containing 0.7 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside) and cultured on a shaking incubator at 37° C., 200 rpm; and, the cell concentration of each culture was determined by measuring absorbance at 600 nm. As clearly illustrated in FIG. 4, the growth of HB101 (◯--◯) harboring pMJ12 which produces recombinant PAP was inhibited remarkably, while the growth of non-transformed HB101 (Δ--Δ) and HB101 (□--□) transformed with pFLAG were normal. Accordingly, it was determined that recombinant PAP inhibits the growth of E. coli HB101 transformed with pMJ12 by virtue of PAP's RNA N-glycosidase activity. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 Expression of recombinant PAP from E. coli HB101 transformed with vector pMJ12 
 E. coli HB101 (KCCM 10037) was cultured on 50 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin; and recombinant PAP was induced by the addition of IPTG (0.75 mM) when the OD 600  of the culture reached 1.0. After PAP induction for 6 hrs, cells thus cultured were harvested by centrifugation, washed 2 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 0.01M NaH 2  PO 4 , 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.4); and subjected to freezing in dry ice-methanol bath and thawing at 37° C. Then, the cell lysate was emulsified with said buffer solution (pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme; and the freeze/thawing process was repeated 3 times. Said solution was shaken at 10 min intervals, kept at 37° C. for 30 min, and centrifuged at 25,000×g for 45 min at 4° C. 10 μl of supernatant thus obtained was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R, and destained with desraining solution; and production of recombinant PAP was determined by Western blot analysis in accordance with Example 6. 
 EXAMPLE 5 
 Isolation of recombinant PAP from E. coli HB101 transformed with vector pMJ12 
 Recombinant PAP produced from E. coli HB101 (KCCM 10037) was isolated at 4° C., in accordance with the following procedures: To the total protein fractionated in Example 4 was added 1M CaCl 2  solution to a final concentration of 1.0 mM; and said solution was loaded on an anti-FLAG MI affinity gel column, after washing the column with 5 ml glycine-HCl (pH 3.0) and  PBS solution  3 times. Then, said column was washed with 12 ml PBS/Ca solution (PBS solution containing 1.0 mM CaCl 2  solution) 3 times. 500 μl of PBS/EDTA solution (PBS solution containing 2.0 mM EDTA) was kept for 30 min in the column to which recombinant PAP was bound; the PAP was then eluted with 500 μl PBS/EDTA solution at an interval of 10 min. The amount and purity of recombinant PAP thus isolated were determined by Bradford's method (See: Bradford, Anal Biochemistry, 72:248 (1976); Anal Biochemistry, 86:142 (1978)) and SDS-PAGE analysis, respectively. The expression level of said recombinant PAP was determined to be 40 mg per 1 L of culture, which is relatively high expression compared with other RIPS. FIG. 5 is a photograph showing the SDS-PAGE pattern of purified recombinant PAP. In FIG. 5, M shows the lane containing low-molecular size markers (Pharmacia, U.S.A.); recombinant PAP is shown in the right hand lane. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 Determination of recombinant PAP from E. coli HB101 transformed with vector pMJ12 
 Total proteins of non-transformed E. coli HB101 and E. coli HB101 transformed with vector PFLAG or pMJ12 were isolated in accordance with Example 4, and Western blot analysis was performed. Protein fractionated by SDS-PAGE was transferred to Hybond-C extra (Amersham, U.K.); and, blocking was performed with a PBS solution containing 0.1   % Tween    20 and 2% BSA. Said protein was washed with PBS solution (containing 0.1% Tween 20) 2 times for 5 min each; and, treated with 2 μg/ml of anti-PAP antibody at room temperature for 1 hr. Then, the filter was washed with said  buffer solution  2 times, treated with rabbit peroxidase-conjugated second antibody at room temperature for 1 hr, and stained with 4-chloro-1-naphthol. As shown in the Western blot analysis of FIG. 6, only one band was detected in E. coli HB101 transformed with pMJ12, and no band was detected in non-transformed HB101 (lane 1) and HB101 transformed with pFLAG (lane 2). 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 Activity determination of recombinant PAP 
 To determine the activity of purified recombinant PAP, which inhibits protein synthesis, in vitro translation employing a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, U.S.A.) was carried out. Recombinant PAP isolated in accordance with the Example 5 and dialyzed against deionized water using a Spectra/ Por  2 membrane (Spectrum, U.S.A.), was employed for the activity determination. The reaction mixtures for in vitro translation were as disclosed in Table 1.

 Each experimental group was incubated at 30° C. for 90 min. Proteins thus synthesized were fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE, dried on a gel dryer and detected by radioautography. FIG. 7 is a photograph showing the results of SDS-PAGE after an in vitro translation experiment. As clearly illustrated in FIG. 7, protein synthesis of luciferase (62KD) is detectable in the control group (lane 1), while no protein is detected in the recombinant PAP (lane 2) group. 
 As clearly illustrated and demonstrated above, the present invention provides a novel expression vector for PAP and a microorganism transformed with said PAP expression vector. In accordance with the present invention, biologically active PAP can be produced in massive quantities from this microorganism. Therefore, the recombinant PAP can be applied to various fields, e.g., molecular studies on PAP and treatment of AIDS employing a PAP immunoconjugate.
