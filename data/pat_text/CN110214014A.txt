 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to the purposes that probiotic composition and the composition are used to treat and/or prevent atopic dermatitis.
Therefore, the present invention may be considered as covering in scope of medicine field, especially treating for skin disease. 
 
 
 Background technique 
 Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the itch of the chronic course of disease, inflammatory dermatosis, is characterized as the development of eczema lesion, and
With characteristic distribution patterns, will affect has skin high to a variety of environmental factors (it is harmless to ergotropy patient)
Reactive patient.Idiocrasy patient usually has the history of personal or family asthma, allergic rhinitis or AD, and has and rise
High IgE serum levels.Atopic dermatitis usually largely influences children, but puberty or manhood can continue and/
Or breaking-out. 
 The illness rate of AD is the 4 to 20% of the mankind.There is great difference between rural area and urban environment, in the latter
Incidence is higher.The incidence of AD may be due to the following reasons and increase: the life style in west, increased pregnant age, pollution,
The breast-feeding of mother smoking and reduction.In 6 initial middle of the month of life, the child development of 45% (45%) at AD, and
Initial 5 years, 85% child development is at AD.When disease when starting for two years old in children below, at seven years old, 20% youngster
Child has lasting symptom. 
 Although atopic dermatitis clinically shows as eczema, under acute and chronic state, the disease present with
Great variability down: the 1) range of clinical manifestation；2) hereditary basis of clinical manifestation；And it is 3) potential under clinical manifestation
Pathogenic mechanism. 
 Illustrate that a most common hypothesis of the origin of atopic dermatitis speculates, is a variety of performances of systematic process
One of (in this case, influencing skin), wherein the process is related to other organs and system of mankind's human body, to produce
Raw a variety of symptoms, such as asthma, food hypersenstivity, allergic rhinitis etc..In fact, the patient of the high percent with these diseases
Peripheral blood in had raised IgE horizontal and eosinophil, but originate from and clinical meaning is all unclear. 
 About pathophysiological mechanism, it is believed that immune response plays main function in its origin.In fact, AD's
In origin, recent data are related to cutaneous dendritic cells (antigen presenting cell) and the inflammatory of Th2 cell mediated is immune
The adjusting of signal.Statistics indicate that the Pathological Physiology origin of AD can be found in these immunologic mechanisms, it is related to antigen presentation skin
The immunological regulation of skin Dendritic Cells and Th2 cell mediated and inflammatory signal.Unknown at present is to cause being immunized in AD
Cascade stimulant source. 
 The disease has the extensive clinic of mild forms (such as hand eczema) to more severe form (such as red fash)
Performance.Pathology or laboratory's type do not have special variation, and therefore, AD diagnosis is clinical, and standard diagnostics are compound
Hanifin-Rajka standard (Hanifin JM, et al.Acta Derm Venereol 1980；92:44-7). 
 The Clinical symptoms of AD is age-related variable, and is included in diagnostic criteria；They include itch, eczema
Lesion caused by lesion and scraping. 
 It itches: being one of most important and consistent discovery of idiocrasy.Idiocrasy itch is strong, and usually leads
Cause outburst.It itches so that patient causes to damage in itself by scraping.Although the reason of itch does not better understand, seemingly
It is the release due to inflammatory mediator and cell factor. 
 Eczema: eczema lesion can be acute and chronic.Acute injury be characterized as spot, papule and erythema, vesicle,
Exudative and very itch patch.It repeats to scrape and friction leads to chronic injury, be characterized as apparent pachyderma, and companion
There is the obvious appearance of lichenification and dry fiber shape papule. 
 Lichenification: observing characteristic moss sample cutaneous lesions, be made of the patch of non-good definition, and
With the pachyderma for showing apparent a crease in the skin and lines. 
 Pruigo: the small papule with unconspicuous vesicle and apparent abrasion (being caused by strong scraping). 
 Exfoliative dermatitis: extensive idiocrasy case can clinically appear similar to general hair property exfoliative dermatitis, wrap
It is contained in the otherness diagnosis of red fash. 
 Other than establishing diagnosis, it is necessary to assessment or quantitative seriousness.For this purpose, a variety of methods and standard have been developed,
To in clinical test, observational study, even in clinical practice (when purpose is sentenced than the subjectivity of patient, nursing staff or doctor
When the progress of patient is more accurately presented in description that is disconnected and providing) in, assess the monitor response of seriousness and treatment.Side herein
In face, method that is most effective and using is so-called SCORAD index (scoring atopic dermatitis), by European Task
Force working group researched and developed (European Task Force on Atopic for atopic dermatitis in 1993
Dermatitis.Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis:the SCORAD index.Dermatology
1993；186:23-31).It is verified in comparative studies, the best approach of the seriousness for evaluating atopic dermatitis, and
And it is also all most widely proved about effect, repeatability, sensibility and acceptability.SCORAD is a kind of points-scoring system, is examined
The basic AD lesion (erythema, oedema/papule, exudation/crust, scratch and lichenification) and symptom (hair of five seed types are considered
Itch and have not enough sleep) degree and intensity. 
 About the different degrees of SCORAD index value for defining seriousness, there are some contradictions.Some Spain's researchs are small
Group thinks slight, moderate or severe is respectively equivalent to index score<25 SCORAD, 25 to 40, or>40, and other author's bases
In the correlation tested with laboratory, score<20 are used respectively, 20 to 40, or>40 define slight, moderate and severe
Symptom. 
 In terms of the treatment of AD, there are consistency, and in the first instance, its object is to inhibit to itch and eliminate inflammatory
Lesion；Secondly, prevent recurrence ( F.2002.JANO,1432:52-7；Boguniewitcz M,Schmid-
Grendelmeier P,and Leung DYM.2006.J Allergy Clin Inmunol,118:40-3).In order to inhibit to send out
Itch and scrape, H1 antithistamine is prescription medicine, but validity does not clearly demonstrate that.The primary and foremost purpose of eczema treatment is control
Inflammatory lesion processed additionally aids control and itches.Therefore, according to the seriousness of damage and status of patient, varying strength is used
Topical corticosteroid.It is the traditional H1 antithistamine (hydroxyl for leading to sedation with obvious preferably those of result medicine
Piperazine, clemastine, dexchlorpheniramine) and a new generation's H1 antithistamine (Dexfenfluramine, Loratadine and spread out at cetirizine
Biology), a new generation H1 antithistamine calmness is slightly worse, but shows the difference for not having statistical significance with placebo sometimes
Result (Boguniewitcz M, et al 2006.Quoted ad supra). 
 The detrimental effect of topical corticosteroid is produced using limitation.It is most universal in the adverse effect for giving site
's.If given in eye circumference, following situations is generally occurred within: atrophoderma, petechia, vergeture, hirsutism, colour fading, capillary
Expansion, epifolliculitis and glaucoma.Not normally, more serious system detrimental effect has already been described, such as hypothalamus-hangs down
Body-hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis inhibition, retarded growth or class cushing's syndrome. 
 Some patients, which lack, has caused the new for the treatment of inflammation to the response of corticosteroid and their detrimental effect
The research and development of drug.In optimal research, for local Ca rely on inhibitors of phosphatases (tacrolimus and Elidel) (Leung,
DYM and Bleder,T.2003,Lancet,361:151-60； F.2002,JANO,1432:52-7).But
About safety of these drugs in long-term treatment, there are still suspection.In fact, the production comprising tacrolimus and Elidel
The content introduction of product (local treatment for atopic dermatitis) shows in the children that they should be only used within two years old, right
In these children, it is not recommended that using no longer valid before topical corticosteroid or topical corticosteroid. 
 In recent years, in the Primary Study of effective quantity, the purposes of probiotics agents treatment AD has been studied, and according to using
Probiotics and test in patient age, as a result difference (Soo-Pk Kim, et al.2014.Ann Allergy
Asthma Immunol.113:217e226；Gerasimov,SV et al.2010.Am J Clin Dermatol,11:
351e361；Farid,R.et al.2011.Iran J Pediatr.21:225e230).Nearest research is (open comprising before
Confluence analysis) prove, under certain environment (combination with age, bacterium bacterial strain or the probiotics and dosage that use), make
With advantageous effect (the 2011 cited ad supra of Farid, R.et al of probiotics；Van del Aa LB,et
al.2010.Clin Exp Allergy.40:795e804；Boyle,RJ et al.2008.Cochrane Database
Syst Rev,4:CD006135:Lee,J.et al.2008.J Allegy Clin Immunol.121:116).It is special in treatment
In the new outburst of answering property dermatitis and prevention disease, the probiotics largely studied belongs to Bifidobacterium and genus lactubacillus, it is seen that
They can generate better result (Lee, J.et al.2008.Quoted ad supra). 
 It is well known that field of medicaments needs to research and develop the treatment for having quality, the long-term treatment for AD is safe and effective
, this is because atopic dermatitis influences the population of important proportion, and (it can lead to significant the quality of the life for influencing them
Cross medical complication influence etc.).Topical corticosteroid is considered as extremely effective treatment method, but implies there is unfavorable work
High risk.New alternatives (such as calcinerin inhibitor) are introduced into topical corticosteroid in response to described
Needs, but not yet defined using the risk of the detrimental effect of these new drugs.Therefore, prior art display is needed to research and develop and be used
In the new composition for the treatment of AD, it has proved that the composition, which is that typical case that is effective and lacking presently used drug is secondary, to be made
With. 
 Detailed description of the invention 
 Author's discovery of the invention, giving probiotic composition, (its enteron aisle for modifying the individual with atopic dermatitis is micro-

 Embodiment 
 The present invention test that people implements through the invention is shown, and shows the property of probiotic composition of the invention. 
 
 
 Embodiment 1: the bacterial micro-organism group in measurement AD patient 
 1.1 materials and method 
 Based on the fecal specimens of 49 dermatosis patients, mentioned using the combined method of the machinery and enzymatic lysis of cell wall and film
Genetic stocks (DNA) is taken, to increase recovery rate and not tend to make to have the bacterium (Gram+) of cell wall to exist.It surveys
Amount assesses quality and quantity (detection by extracting the genetic stocks obtained, using Nanodrop 2000ThermoScientific
Ratio is 260/280 and 260/230), shows to extract quality (there are PCR inhibitor, pigment etc.).Hereafter, material is being confirmed
After quality, implement large scale sequencing library, the scheme according to Illumina captures the hypermutation of bacterium 16s rRNA gene
Area V3-V4 (is based on Klindworth A, et al. (2013) Nucleic Acids Res 41:e1), the 16s based on capture
The composition of rRNA analysis microorganism.Each library is quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen of Invitrogen, and
Equimolar is mixed for last sequencing. 
 On MiSeq platform, sample is sequenced in the combination of 300 " both-end sequencing " circulation.To resulting FASTQ file
It is handled, to ensure the sequence analysis of high-quality.To this purpose, implement by the following quality control constituted: 
 1. program ' pear'v0.9.6. connection end is used, to rebuild unique sequence (Zhang J, et al
(2014)Bioinformatics 30(5):614-20)。 
 2. using 1.9.1 editions cutadapt programs, sequence measuring joints and capture primer (Martin are eliminated by hypervariable region V3 and V4
M(2010)EMBnet.journal[S.L.],17(1):10-12.ISSN 2226-6089.)。 
 3. using 0.91 edition FASTX-ToolKit, low-quality sequence is eliminated. 
 4. using UCHIME program and final chimera database, the chimera (Dec generated by PCR is eliminated
2015)(Edgar RC,et al(2011)Aug 15；27(16):2194-200). 
 It, will using BLAST type Local Alignment (Altschul SF, et al (1990) J.Mol Biol.215:403-410)
Resulting sample is compared with the sequence database of 16S rRNA (NCBI). 
 In the case where different taxology is horizontal: door, section, category and kind check each sequence, obtain these sequences and are scored at
95% (95%) consistency. 
 R statistical package is for counting, so that building is used for the chart of principal component analysis (PCA). 
 What is interesting is, it is noted that there is greatly variation, epidemiology in the alimentary canal micropopulation of each individual
Research shows that the micropopulation of nearly all individual, which can classify, belongs to 3 different classifications, referred to as visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis (Arumugam
et al.,(2011)Nature 473:174-180).The classification is that (Bacteroides, Prey irrigate Pseudomonas or tumor based on 3 kinds of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis
The member of abrasive net-balloon for stomach Pseudomonas) one of advantage visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis.Visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 1 (ent1) refers in Bacteroides dominance, visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2 (ent2)
It is dominant to refer to that Prey irrigates Pseudomonas, and visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3 (ent3) refers in Ruminococcus dominant (Dave et al., (2012)
.Trans.Res.160,246-257)。 
 II. result 
 As referenced above, compared with the fecal specimens obtained by healthy individuals, by suffering from atopic dermatitis
In the fecal specimens that individual obtains, the composition of microorganism is analyzed. 
 The results show that as shown in Figure 1, the microorganism overview of the sample obtained by AD patient more connects than other healthy individuals
It is bordering on the healthy individuals of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3.Shown in the upper left side figure of Fig. 1 as mentioned above, AD patient's (quadrangle and black symbols) with
The healthy individuals of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3 (diamond shape and light grey symbol) flock together, but AD patient more divides than the healthy individuals of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3
It dissipates.On the contrary, in visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 1 (round and Dark grey symbol) or the healthy population of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2 (triangle and gray symbols)
Body is gathered in a part (from left to right) at top respectively and left side (from top to bottom).It is further noted that being gathered in figure
The fertile Pseudomonas of Bacteroides and less Prey of the sample of the right-hand side of table with more high abundance and Ruminococcus, and Fig. 1
In chart top assemble sample present clearly lack Prey irrigate Pseudomonas；Therefore, it is obtained by the healthy patients of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2
Sample (strain that the Prey with more high abundance irrigates Pseudomonas) is located below in the corner of left hand, and shows bacillus faecalis category and tumor
Abrasive net-balloon for stomach Pseudomonas increases.These data make we show the microbial flora of AD patient closer to the healthy individuals of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3, still
With different composition and microbiology turbidity. 
 When passing through Shannon index, for the sample of AD patient, (each of 3 kinds of different visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis is all had in health population
Kind) sample in, when analyzing the variability of bacterial community (Fig. 2), in the healthy individuals and AD patient of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3, this difference
Variability and microorganism group at more detailed concern.As shown in Fig. 2, in general, AD patient has higher compared with healthy individuals
Variability has intermediate and interquartile-range IQR 2.97 (2.84 to 3.06) variability for atopic dermatitis patients, and for intestines
The healthy individuals of type 1,2 and 3, be respectively provided with 1.99 (1.37 to 2.52), 2.14 (1.50 to 2.62) and 2.23 (1.91 to
2.57) variability.Specifically, AD patient has the bacterium variability for any one visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis for being apparently higher than healthy individuals,
These are because in all cases, when by the microbiology turbidity of AD patient compared with the health population with different visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis, p
<0.0001。 
 In order to measure the bacterium for mutually distinguishing health population with atopic dermatitis group, we are based on Bacteroides
(ent1), Prey irrigates the dominant bacteria of Pseudomonas (ent2) and Ruminococcus (ent3), continues that the trouble of atopic dermatitis will be suffered from
Person's classification.Then, we detect the various different visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis in health population from AD crowd's between different visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis with the presence or absence of poor
It is different.Firstly, 25 are classified as ent1 in amounting to 49 AD patients；2 are classified as ent2；And 22 are classified as ent3.It is similar
Ground, in 324 healthy study subjects, 298 are classified as ent1；21 are classified as ent2；And 5 are classified as ent3.Then,
In AD patient, compared with healthy study subject, in each visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 1,2 or 3, bacterium variability is analyzed. 
 Fig. 3 shows the bacterium variability in healthy study subject and AD patient (all having visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 1).As shown in figure 3, strong
Health individual ratio AD patient has the Bacteroides of more high abundance, and AD patient shows bacillus faecalis category and the Bifidobacterium of more high abundance
Belong to, and especially there is the strain of the another branch Pseudomonas of ground abundance. 
 Fig. 4 shows the bacterium variability in healthy study subject and AD patient (all having visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2).In such case
Under, in terms of the category of bacterium, it is impossible to distinguish the AD patient of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2 with the healthy individuals of identical visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis.On the other hand, this
Width figure shows that the level for the AD patient for being classified as visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2 is lower. 
 As having the case where healthy individuals of visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 1 and AD patient, (Fig. 5), AD in the AD patient for being classified as visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 3
There are apparent differences compared with healthy individuals by patient.As shown in figure 5, AD patient compared with healthy patients, has less category
In the strain that Ruminococcus belongs to, and the more low-abundance strain for belonging to bacillus faecalis category. 
 In view of all results illustrated above, it is therefore clear that the microbial flora of AD patient is different from health population
The composition and variability of microbial flora.Also show, less AD patient belongs to visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 2, in addition, AD patient also show it is increased
Microbiology turbidity, but little bacteria belongs to the strain of important category in each visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis, especially Bacteroides and Ruminococcus
(for visible peristalsis visible intestinal peristalsis 1 and 3).

Total number of days that the total number of days and antihistaminicum that corticosteroid uses use. 
 
 
 
 Implement multiple linear regression analyses, so that assessment uses this hair compared with its dependent variable that can influence SCORAD
The independent action that bright probiotic composition is treated.In this analysis, SCORAD variable is inputted as independent variable.In addition to
It include following variable other than variable " treatment type ": " total number of days of antihistaminicum treatment ", " corticosteroid of clinical test
Total number of days for the treatment of " and " SCORAD when baseline ". 
 After the treatment one month when, unique variable significantly related with SCORAD index be treatment type.Therefore, divided
With the group treated using probiotic composition of the invention and SCORAD be absolutely reduced to 9.07 points it is related.In other words,
In first month, in the overall reduction of observing SCORAD in the tissue treated using probiotic composition of the invention,
Composition of the invention makes the variation be 66% (66%) (the 9.07 of 13.69SCORAD point).Total day of antihistaminicum treatment
The variable of total number of days of several variation and corticosteroid treatment is unrelated with SCORAD index. 
 In addition, evaluation system corticosteroid disappears in a manner of identical with described in topical corticosteroid consumption
Consumption, such as secondary variable specified before.Result obtained, which is consumed, for Systemic corticosteroid is not shown in two treatments
Significant difference related with these compounds are used between group: composition and placebo of the invention. 
 The patient raised in test shows them by minimum detrimental effect, such as in head 5 days stomach and intestine gas for the treatment of
Swollen: wherein the patient of 30% (30%) takes composition of the invention, the non-placebo of patient with 14% (14%). 
 In short, in the present embodiment, giving probiotic composition of the invention as the result is shown for treating AD and using peace
The result for consoling agent treatment patient is compared, and provides benefit in terms of effect and tolerance.Therefore, the parameter analyzed is shown in use
Than the patient group of placebo treatment, SCORAD index has significantly to be changed the AD patient of probiotic composition treatment of the invention
It is kind.This improvement can be from taking in observing for 1st month for probiotic composition of the invention, and this improvement is in treatment
2nd and further analysis at 3 months in be maintained or increase. 
 In addition, total number of days of topical corticosteroid must be used about patient in each group, although the benefit that intake is of the invention
The average value of the group of raw bacteria composition is slightly higher than placebo (3.3% and 2.6%), but this species diversity is not significant.On the contrary,
It (is tied under baseline and in research in more identical group when analyzing the consumption of cortin under level between group between study subject
The use of corticosteroid when beam), (8% (8%) is reduced in the subsequent time) compared with placebo, in the intake present invention
Probiotic composition group in (steroids consumption reduce by 55% (55%)), observe the time mistake of lower steroids consumption
Journey trend has statistical significance in this case. 
 
 
 Embodiment 3: probiotic composition of the invention is used to prevent the function analysis of AD outburst 
 In 20 (20) the AD patients recruited under study for action, those of 6 progress period analyses are reached to SCORAD index.It should
Patient group is specifically monitored, until completing 3 months whole treatment phases.10 (10) patients receive placebo (Figure 11,
Black line), and 9 patients receive probiotics (Figure 11, gray line). 
 Figure 11 is shown at the time of completing treatment in 3 months using probiotics 12 weeks after treatment end, all these
In patient, for monitoring the result of AD outburst quantity.Therefore, Figure 11 shows the patient populations (Figure 11 A) by new AD outburst, tool
Have the tendency that the total quantity (Figure 11 B) of the patient of new AD outburst and the percentage (Figure 11 C) without the patient newly broken out；
In view of all patients treated before, Figure 11 receives in the patient of placebo before being shown in, in 12 weeks treatment-free periods
It breaks out quantity, patient populations and receives those of probiotics patient before being higher than by the percentage of the patient of new AD outburst. 
 Therefore, it in the sub-group of patients, is controlled using patient's ratio that probiotic composition of the invention is treated using placebo
The group for the treatment of shows lower recurrence rate and/or deterioration rate (respectively 1/10th (10%) and 5/9ths (55%)) (figure respectively
11B)。 
 For 3 variables analyzed, the evaluations in 3 months after monitoring starts are interim, the difference tool between 2 intervention groups
It is statistically significant. 
 Support the data of effect of the probiotics in terms of preventing new AD outburst generation as follows: text refers to prebiotic in use
3 middle of the month after bacteria composition stopped treatment, the individual treated using the composition are had than not receiving those for the treatment of
Patient lower outburst, therefore with the longer time without stadium. 
 These results prove using composition of the invention to be effective in prevention AD is newly broken out.Therefore, this is being used
3 middle of the month after the probiotic composition stopped treatment of invention receive placebo using patient's ratio that the composition is treated
Patient have lower illness outbreak, therefore have longer no stadium.
