 Background technique 
 Xylan is the non-starch polysaccharide (Non-strach for being keyed by β-D-1,4- xyloside and being contained there are many substituent group
Polysaccharides, NSP), it is the important component of plant cell wall hemicellulose.Existing literature Mendoza G D,

From β-D-1,4- the endo-xylanase catalyst structure domain of Orpinomyces sp.PC-2, in fermentation the 5th day, activity
Reach 50~360U/mL.It is latent that this shows that β-D-1, the 4- endo-xylanase from Orpinomyces sp.PC-2 has
Development volue.Compared to β-D-1, the 4- endo-xylanase in other sources, the β-D-1 of Orpinomyces sp.PC-2,
4- endo-xylanase has more advantage.The study found that when using birch xylan as substrate, Orpinomyces sp.PC-2's
Natural β-D-1,4- endo-xylanase specific activity reaches 3500U/mg protein, and the β-D-1 in other sources, 4- inscribe wood are poly-
Carbohydrase specific activity is only 20~600U/mg.Such as derive from Trichoderma viride (Trichoderma viride) and Aspergillus
β-D-1,4- endo-xylanase the specific activity of syndowii is respectively 152U/mg and 204U/mg.Teixeira etc. (2010) report
Road is when using wheat bran as carbon source, β-D-1,4- the endo-xylanase ratio of aspergillus awamori (Aspergillus awamori) generation

 Although β-D-1, the 4- endo-xylanase of Orpinomyces sp.PC-2 has Development volue, have
Research shows that its natural and heterologous expression levels is lower, be not able to satisfy the needs of industrial applications.To foreign gene
It is one of the approach for improving foreign gene and expressing in host that codon, which optimizes,.By optimizing to external source gene codon
Afterwards, a large amount of foreign genes have obtained high level expression in Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris.Such as enzyme activity after cellulose enzyme gene optimization
Property improve 1.24 times of (Akcapinar G B, Gul O, Sezerman U.Effect of codon optimization on

After (Fibrobacter succinogenes) 1,3-1,4- beta glucan enzyme gene carries out codon optimization, dextranase activity
Compared with improving 25.1% before optimization, (Yang Yuxia, Zhang Huiling, Wang Yan wait .2014. to produce succinic acid filiform bacillus 1,3-1,4- β-Portugal poly-
Expression Agricultural University Of Nanjing journal of the carbohydrase gene in Pichia pastoris, 37 (4): 123-130.). 
 The optimization of codon is limited primarily at present soft using some optimizations to the preferences of codon according to Pichia pastoris
Part is replaced codon, and most codon optimization tool and software are also based on above-mentioned principle and design.Pass through
The expression of the above method, some genes is improved.However, foreign gene to be made to obtain high-caliber expression, Jin Jinyi
It is inadequate by above-mentioned optimization, it is also contemplated that rejecting the code area of the nonessential group of enzyme, the GC percentage of gene, mRNA second level knot
The minimum free energy of structure, mRNA cryptic splice site and unstable motif etc..And these are not obtained in current gene optimization
Consider to comprehensive, meanwhile, correlative study has not been reported.
