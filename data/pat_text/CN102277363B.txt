 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to molecular biology and microbiological art.More particularly, the present invention relates to the nitrilase of the sudden change of the nitrilase activity with improvement, described nitrilase is used for 3-hydroxyl nitrile to be converted into 3-hydroxycarboxylic acid. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 The novel polymer with excellent properties, peculiar property, the cost efficiency of improvement, quality and low ecological impact is just causing the attention of industry member.Particularly, need the functional polymer with side chain, dense structure and end strips reactive group, because compared with conventional line style statistical copolymer, they have lower limiting viscosity and the activity of Geng Gao. 
 The polymkeric substance of such excellence is by copolymerization highly-branched (hyperbranching) hydroxycarboxylic acid comonomer (highly-branched AB
         n type, wherein A and B has the derivative reactive group part of hydroxyl or carboxyl, and n is two or more) (Hult etc., pp.656-658 and Voit etc., pp.658-659 in
         concise Polymeric Materials Encyclopedia , editor .J.C.Salomone, CRCPress, New York, 1999) and multiple line style hydroxycarboxylic acid comonomer (line style AB type) comprises 3-hydroxypentanoic acid (3-HVA) and prepared by 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HBA).
       
 3-hydroxycarboxylic acid is used as comonomer for the manufacture of linear polyesters.Polyester is used as thermoplasticity, thermoset, hypocrystalline, amorphous, rigidity and elastomer material.They are main component (Goodman, pp.793-799 in of fiber, film, moulded product and coating
         concise   encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering , editor .J.I.Kroschwitz, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1990).
       
 In the fermentation using candida rugosa (Candida rugosa), 3-hydroxypentanoic acid (Hasegawa etc., J.Ferment.Technol.59:257-262 (1981) are prepared by the 3-hydroxylation of valeric acid; JP 59053838 B4), and by using pseudomonas putida (Pseudomonas putida), producing cyanine Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pseudomonasfluorescens), being oxidized Arthrobacter (Arthrobacter oxydans) and Arthrobactercrystallopietes, through the 3-hydroxylation of the valeric acid of fermentation, prepare the single enantiomer (U.S.3 of 3-hydroxypentanoic acid similarly, 553,081).These methods for valeric acid fermentation oxidation produce the 3-hydroxypentanoic acid of low production concentration usually, and from fermention medium, are separated 3-hydroxypentanoic acid need well-designed and somewhat expensive.By chemical degradation (Seebach etc., HeIv.CMm.Acta 77:2007-2034 (1994)) or poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate ester/3-hydroxyl valerate) fermentation prepare (R)-(-)-3-hydroxypentanoic acid from degraded (WO 9929889), but the degraded of hydroxybutyric acid/hydroxyl pentanoate copolymer needs to be separated with by product 3-hydroxypentanoic acid by 3-hydroxybutyrate arduously equally.Also by enzymatic reduction 3-oxopentanoic acid (Bayer etc., Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol.42:543-547 (1994)) or asymmetric hydrogenation methyl 3-oxopentanoic acid ester then saponification (Burk etc., Organometallics 9:2653-2655 (1990)) prepare (R)-(-)-3-hydroxypentanoic acid. 
 By number of chemical method, nitrile is easily converted into corresponding carboxylic acid.These methods need strong acidity and basic reaction conditions and high reaction temperature, and usually produce unwanted by product and/or a large amount of inorganic salt as unwanted waste.Additionally there is the reaction conditions of the nitrile of hydroxyl, such as, reaction conditions for by 3-hydroxyvaleronitrile conversion being 3-hydroxypentanoic acid for chemical hydrolysis, less desirable primary, secondary or tertiary hydroxyl usually can be caused to eliminate, produce carbon-to-carbon double bond. 
 Nitrile enzymatic hydrolysis is corresponding carboxylic acid is often preferred chemical process, because this reaction is carried out usually at ambient temperature, without the need to strong acidity or basic reaction conditions, and produces product needed for highly selective with high conversion.The combination of two kinds of enzymes---Nitrile hydratase and Ntn hydrolase can be used in aqueous fatty nitrile being converted into corresponding carboxylic acid.Start, by Nitrile hydratase, fatty nitrile is converted into acid amides, then, by Ntn hydrolase, acid amides is converted into corresponding carboxylic acid subsequently.Known various bacteria Pseudomonas has different Nitrile hydratases and lactamase activity spectrum (Sugai etc., Biosci.Biotech.Biochem.61:1419-1427 (1997)), comprise Rhod (Rhodococcus), Rhodopseudomonas (Pseudomonas), produce Thiobacillus (Alcaligenes), joint core bacterium belongs to (Arthrobacter), bacillus (Bacillus), bacteridium (Bacteridium), brevibacterium sp (Brevibacterium), corynebacterium (Corynebacterium) and micrococcus sp (Micrococcus).Fungi joint sickle spore (Fusarium merismoides) TG-1 has also been used as catalyzer for hydrolysed fat nitrile and dintrile (Asano etc., Agric.Biol.Chem.44:2497-2498 (1980)).Be used to 3-hydroxypropionitrile, 3-hydroxyl heptonitrile and 3-hydroxyl pelargonitrile to be hydrolyzed to corresponding 3-hydroxycarboxylic acid from the immobilization Nitrile hydratase of rhodococcus (Rhodococcus sp.) (SP409 from Novo Industri) and Ntn hydrolase, productive rate is respectively 63%, 62% and 83% (de Raadt etc., J.Chem.Soc.Perkin Trans.1,137-140 (1992)).TLC is used to also been observed the formation of corresponding acid amides.In contrast, the Nitrile hydratase of the purifying of bacillus pallidus (Bacilluspallidas) Dac521 is hydrolyzed multiple fatty nitrile, but be not hydrolyzed 3-hydroxypropionitrile (Cramp etc., Biochim.Biophys.Acta 1431:249-260 (1999)). 
 Nitrile is also converted into corresponding carboxylic acid and ammonia by single enzyme---nitrilase in aqueous, but does not have amide intermediate to form (equation 1 and 2).

 All known nitrilases, comprise Acidovorax facilis 72W nitrilase, all have halfcystine (Cowan etc., Extremophiles, the 2:207-216 (1998) of nucleophilic in enzyme active center; Pace, H. and Brenner, C, Genome Biology, 2 (1): reviews 1-9 (2001); With Chauhan etc., the same) and be all subject to thiol reagent (cupric chloride of 1.0mM concentration, Silver Nitrate, mercuric acetate or iron(ic) chloride, each all causes Acidovorax facilis 72W nitrilase enzymic activity significantly to reduce) impact and inactivation.Cysteine residues also irreversibly can be oxidized to-sulfinic acid, causes loss of enzyme activity.Although nitrilase is responsive to multiple inactivation, immobilized Acidovorax facilis 72W cell is stable, can keep its most of nitrilase activity (US 6,870,038) after repeatedly reusing reaction. 
 Already reported the gene comparision (Chauhan etc., the same) of Acidovorax facilis 72W nitrilase and other bacterial enzyme nitriles.This 72W nitrilase has several conservative distinct domain, comprises contiguous aminoterminal 16-amino acid district (the amino-acid residue 40-55 of SEQ ID NO:4) and the catalytic domain (the amino-acid residue 160-173 of SEQ ID NO:4) containing required cysteine residues.This cysteine residues (Cys164 of SEQ ID NO:4), together with conservative L-glutamic acid (Glu48 of SEQ ID NO:4) and lysine residue (Lys130 of SEQ ID NO:4), be formed in the catalysis three symbasis sequence (Pace all existed in all nitrilases, H., and Brenner, C, the same).Although there is similar guarding in some structure in the nitrilase of report, the substrate specificity of these enzymes alters a great deal (O ' Reilly, C. and Turner, P., JAppl Microbiol, 95:1161-1174 (2003)). 
 
 enzyme characteristic 
 
 Under specified requirements, test has the 72W nitrilase of the sudden change of the relative nitrilase activity of improvement, and 3-hydroxyvaleronitrile conversion can be 3-hydroxypentanoic acid or 3-hydroxybutyronitrile is converted into 3-hydroxybutyrate by described nitrilase activity.The screening method measuring 3-HVN to 3-HVA conversion is used to select those to have the nitrilase mutants of the nitrilase activity of improvement. 
 By with the improvement of nitrilase activity comparative measurement nitrilase activity contrasting (quick eat sour 72W (ATCC 55746) nitrilase).By measured activity unit (U) is calculated nitrilase activity divided by catalyst weight.Can according to the weight determination catalyst weight of the protein wt of purifying, cell moisture, dry cell weight or immobilized catalyzer (catalyzer/alginate bead that GA/PEI-is crosslinked).In the present invention, nitrilase activity is recorded as the activity unit (U/g DCW) of every gram of dry cell weight or the activity unit of every gram of catalyzer pearl (immobilized catalyzer contrast).Contrast based on the nitrilase activity of dry cell weight as unit catalyst weight, nitrile hydrolytic enzyme protein matter generation level should be considered.Measure the expression level between different transformant and contrast, and to observe be substantially the same.Therefore.For different mutant, the improvement of the nitrilase activity reported is owing to the modification in enzymatic structure. 
 Express in identical carrier (pTrcHis2-TOPO) and host (large intestine bar TOP10) or intestinal bacteria FM5 background the present invention sudden change nitrilase (and Acidovorax facilis 72W (ATCC 55746) nitrilase contrast; SEQ ID NO:4) encoding sequence.It is substantially the same (as owing to using desired by identical expression system and host) that SDS-PAGE analysis (as used laser light density analysis standard measure) demonstrates nitrile hydrolytic enzyme protein matter expression level in often kind of mutant (and contrast).The nitrilase activity that relative activity is registered as the catalyzer of difference sudden change measures increases for the multiple contrasting the nitrilase activity measured in transformant the intestinal bacteria of expressing Acidovorax facilis 72W nitrilase (SEQID NO:4). 
 For not immobilized catalyzer, under 25 DEG C (pH 7.0), be converted into the transformation efficiency of 3-hydroxycarboxylic acid by the 3-hydroxyl nitrile solution measuring the 0.5M of every gram of dry cell weight, determine the nitrilase activity (U/g dry cell weight) of the nitrilase suddenlyd change.Immobilized catalyzer is contrasted, is that the transformation efficiency of 3-HVA determines concrete activity by measuring the 3-HVN solution transforms of 0.4M under 35 DEG C (pH 7.0), and is recorded as the nitrilase activity units (U/g pearl) of every gram of pearl.The nitrilase activity (U) of one unit be equivalent under 25 DEG C (or at 35 DEG C, for immobilized catalyzer) 1 micromole 3-hydroxycarboxylic acid/minute generation.In the present invention, nitrilase activity units is recorded on the basis that 3-hydroxypentanoic acid or 3-hydroxybutyrate produce. 
 For the nitrilase of specific sudden change, use one of lower column format, replace about the point in Acidovorax facilis 72W aminoacid sequence (SEQ ID NO:4) DNA encoding district the amino acid change suddenling change and obtain and described in detail: 
 1. extended format: providing wild-type amino acid in SEQ ID NO:4 (using the 3-letter abbreviations of standard) and corresponding amino acid residue position, is the amino acid seen at identical residue positions in mutant, such as afterwards." Thr210 changes into Ala " or " Thr210 → Ala " describe a kind of in SEQ ID NO:4 amino-acid residue the 210th place as suddenly change result---Threonine is changed into the sudden change of L-Ala by this. 
 2. shorthand: the amino acid residue position after wild-type amino acid (being expressed as the one-letter abbreviations of standard) being SEQ ID NO:4, then be the amino acid (being also expressed as the one-letter abbreviations of standard) of sudden change afterwards.Such as, " T210A " describe a kind of in SEQ IDNO:4 amino-acid residue the 210th place as suddenly change result---Threonine is changed into the sudden change of L-Ala by this.
