 The present invention relates to a novel DNA fragment encoding non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide which is found at the time of infection or onset of the non-A non-B hepatitis. 
 It also relates to an expression vector containing said DNA fragment, to a host cell transformed with said expression vector and to an expressed polypeptide obtained by culturing said host cell. 
 It further relates to a single stranded DNA sequence for PCR primer synthesized on the basis of a partial base sequence of said DNA fragment. 
 It also relates to the use of said expressed polypeptide and said single stranded DNA sequence in detection of the non-A non-B hepatitis virus. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Non-A non-B hepatitis is an infectious disease which is caused by a masked virus other than hepatitis A and B viruses, but it is not easy to identify the virus because amounts of the virus-specific antigens are very small in a patient's body as well as amounts of anti-virus antibodies. Accordingly, diagnosis of non-A non-B hepatitis has been made serologically by the well-known method of "diagnosis by exclusion" wherein the increase in levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase is determined in a serum from a patient to make a diagnosis as to whether or not the hepatitis belongs to any of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis D and other hepatitis symptoms caused by the known hepatopathy viruses such as CMV, EBV, etc, and if the result of diagnosis are not applicable to them, then this case is identified as non-A non-B hepatitis. It, however, is difficult to diagnose clinically as being non-A non-B hepatitis by such a method because there is no correlation between ALT value and non-A non-B hepatitis. Also, the lack of trustworthy means for the diagnosis is a serious problem, whereby a secondary infection with the non-A non-B hepatitis virus which may be caused by transfusing blood, especially, from a non-A non-B hepatitis virus-carrying healthy carrier into a person can hardly be prevented. Therefore, it has been assumed that the non-A non-B hepatitis occupies more than 90% of hepatitis cases caused by blood transfusion, corresponding to about one million of total patients a year. 
 In order to improve such situation and to raise a diagnostic accuracy of non-A non-B hepatitis, the Alter's panel in which standard sera are used has been developed by Alter at al at the NIH. Diagnostic materials which can pass the Alter's panel have been obtained by Arima et al [JIKKEN IGAKU (Japan), 1 (2), 196-201 (1989)] and by M. Houghton et al (WO 89/04669, PCT/JP90/500880) of Chiron Corp. almost simultaneously. Arima et al have screened sera from hepatitis patients using λgt11 (protein expression vector) which was derived from vital RNA from a non-A non-B hepatitis patient's serum. Also, Chiron Corp. have inoculated the patient's blood plasma into a chimpanzee to develop a chronic hepatitis, the blood plasma being obtained from the diseased animal which possesses the anti-virus antibodies with high titer, and then have screened in the same way as Arima et al. Chiron Corp.'s group has also succeeded in cloning almost the whole portion of the gene of a hepatitis C virus (HCV, designated by Chiron Corp.) and developed a kit for diagnosis which comprises an antigenic protein obtained by expressing a part of the HCV gene, 
 In spite of such an effort, however, what is a causative agent of this disease, as well as numbers of the agent, has not yet been elucidated fully. 
 As described above, the two materials which can pass the Alter's panel have certainly led to a new technique of diagnosis replaced by said "diagnosis by exclusion", but screening patient's sera separately with the materials gives no results to be satisfied because both the materials from Arima et al and Chiron Corp. react with patient's sera in low positive ratios of about 60 to 80% and about 50 to 70%, respectively. In other words, in some cases, these materials would not react with sera from the patients who have been diagnosed clinically as non-A non-B hepatitis. A virus commonly have a function to cause mutation in their host cells for their surval, and thus the viral genes isolated from American patients by Chiron Corp. had been possibly mutated into various forms acclimated to chimpanzee as an infection intermediate. 
 Accordingly, a great demand has been directed to a large scale preparation of the reactive antigens which are capable of probing the non-A non-B hepatitis patients or carriers, and it is therefore necessary to construct effective cDNA clones through the isolation and purification of variously mutated viral RNA from many non-A non-B hepatitis patients. 
 In addition, in the case of sera which have failed in a trustworthy diagnosis using an antibody detection system, or sera which are collected immediately after infection and in which antibody titers do not yet raise, a gene amplification method (PCR method) may be useful for the confirmation of the disease because it can detect a trace amount of vital genes. Also, it is possible to clone the genes efficiently by the PCR method. However, since the PCR method is carried out using primers which are synthesized from a known gene sequence, it is not always possible to detect a gene of the non-A non-B hepatitis virus in a patient's fluid using primers which can be constructed on the basis of the HCV gene sequences determined by Chiron Corp., if a difference in mutation between said HCV gene of Chiron Corp. and said patient-carried viral gene is significant. 
 In consequence, to detect efficiently infection with the non-A non-B hepatitis virus, it is necessary to prepare at least one primer capable of detecting the viral gene with a high specificity. Such a purpose may be accomplished by isolating a great number of cDNA clones, synthesizing primers from relatively conserved regions among their gene sequences, and subjecting the resulting primers to screening through the PCR method. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 This invention provides a novel DNA fragment which encodes a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide derived from a non-structural or structural protein of the non-A non-B hepatitis virus, the polypeptide being formed at the time of the infection or onset of the non-A non-B hepatitis. 
 This invention also provides an expression vector containing the DNA fragment, a host cell transformed with the expression vector, an expressed polypeptide obtained by culturing the host cell, and a process for its production. 
 This invention further provides a primer for use in the detection of non-A non-B type hepatitis virus genes. 
 This invention further yet provides use of the expressed polypeptide or single stranded DNA primer in detection of the non-A non-B hepatitis virus, and a method for the detection of non-A non-B hepatitis virus genes and anti-non-A non-B hepatitis virus antibodies.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 Many aspects and advantages of the present invention will be made apparent to those skilled in the art by the following detailed description about preferred embodiments of the invention. 
 The present invention provides a specified DNA fragment comprising a base sequence which encodes a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide derived from a non-structural or structural protein of the non-A non-B type hepatitis virus. 
 The preparation of the DNA fragment of the present invention is characterized in that variously mutated genes of pathogenic viruses were directly collected from a fresh blood plasma pool of a number of non-A non-B hepatitis patients. More particularly, the preparation comprises the steps in which the total RNA including non-A non-B hepatitis virus RNA is isolated from the blood plasma pool, cDNAs are synthesized based on the isolated RNA by the well-known random primer method, and then the cDNA obtained is incorporated into λ phage to prepare a cDNA library. The cDNA library is subsequently immunoscreened using sera from a non-A non-B hepatitis patient to obtain DNA fragments of interest. Thereafter, using the resulting DNA Thereafter, using the resulting DNA fragments as probe, cDNA libraries obtained from the blood plasma from several chronic non-A non-B hepatitis patients were subjected to hybridization assay in order to isolate cDNA which has a homology different from the known counterparts and which is specific for the non-A non-B hepatitis patient. 
 Such a process makes it possible to provide the viral antigens which are markedly useful for the diagnosis of non-A non-B hepatitis patients carrying the variously mutated viruses and for the improvement of detection accuracy of the hepatitis viruses contained in blood for transfusion which was collected from many latent carriers carrying non-A non-B type hepatitis viruses. 
 The following describes the present invention in detail with regard to the preparation of cDNA library, isolation and sequencing of DNA fragments, expression and isolation of polypeptides, and their application to diagnosis of non-A non-B hepatitis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or PCR method. 
 Preparation of cDNA Library 
 Firstly, cell debris is removed from each of freshly collected blood plasma samples of several non-A non-B hepatitis patients by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant is again subjected to centrifugation at a higher rotation speed to obtain a pellet. The pellet is subjected to an equilibrium density gradient centrifugation using cesium trifluoroacetate to isolate total RNA as a precipitate, and the total RNA is purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 
 By the method of Gubler and Hoffman using random primers, cDNA is synthesized from the above RNA fraction. The cDNA is methylated by treating it with a DNA methylase (for example, EcoRI methylase), ligated with a DNA linker (for example, EcoRI linker) or DNA adapter (for example, EcoRI adapter), and then cloned into a cloning vector such as λ phage (for example, λgt10 or λgt11) to prepare a cDNA library. 
 Isolation and Sequencing of DNA Fragments 
 Next, Escherichia coli is infected with the λ phage cDNA library and cultured on an agar plate to form plaques. These plaques are transferred on a nitrocellulose filter, and subjected to blocking followed by immunoscreening using a non-A non-B hepatitis serum in order to detect positive clones. Alternatively, to improve efficiency of the screening, each positive clone obtained is cloned into a cloning vector such as plasmid and a  32  P-labeled DNA probe is prepared by random primer technique, and then positive plaques are detected from the aforementioned cDNA library using the probe. 15, C10-16, C10-17, C10-18, C10-19, C10-21, C10-22, C10-23, C10-35, C11-C21, C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15. 
 A cDNA sample is obtained from each λ phage DNA of 18 clones in a traditional manner and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes such as EcoRI and BamHI. Each cDNA fragment obtained is purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, incorporated into a sequencing vector (M13 phage), and then subjected to the dideoxy chain termination method [Sanger et al; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 74, 5463 (1977)] in order to determine a base sequence of each cDNA fragment. 
 Nucleotide sequences of these clones and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in FIGS. 1 to 18 and in a Sequence Listing which will be described later as SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 18. That is, the SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 18 respectively represent the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences determined from clones C11-7, C10-11, C10-13, C10-14,C10-15, C10-16, C10-17, C10-18, C10-19, C10-21, C10-22, C10-23, C10-35, C11-C21, C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15. Also, the base pair (BP) number of their DNA fragments is 763 BF, 615 BP, 771 BP, 630 BP, 1426 BP, 855 BP, 315 BP, 911 BP, 489 BP, 1076 BP, 284 BP, 641 BP, 432 BP, 369 BP, 932 BP, 559 BP, 276 BP and 742BP, respectively. 
 All the 18 clones contained continuous open reading frames but not termination codons. 
 Analysis of genomic RNA has revealed that hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a class of virus similar to the genus Flavivirus such 
 Analysis of genomic RNA has revealed that hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a class of virus similar to the genus Flavivirus such as Japanese encephalitis virus [Protein, Nucleic Acid and Enzyme (Japan), 35 (12), 2117-2127 (1990)]. From the comparison of homology between the reported gene and polypeptide of Flavivirus and those of the present invention, it was found that clones C11-C21, C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15 encode a structural protein of the non-A non-B type hepatitis virus. More particuarly, clone C11-C12 is a gene which encodes the core of non-A non-B hepatitis virus, and clones C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15 are genes encoding a region between the latter half of the virus core and the env, or a region downstream from the env. Other clones were found to be genes encoding non-structural proteins of the virus. 
 The nucleotide sequences of the above 18 clones and the amino acid sequences translated along the open reading frames showed homologies with those of hepatitis C virus (HCV) reported by Houghton et al (EP-A-318,216, 1988). Thus, clones C11-7, C10-16, C10-17, C10-18, C10-19, C10-21, C10-22 and C10-23 showed relatively high homologies with HCV: 80 to 82% homology at nucleic acid level and 91 to 94% at amino acid level. In addition, these clones showed more higher homologies with the sequence J1 reported by Miyamura et al. (Nuc. Aci. Res., 17, 10367-10372, 1989): 85 to 95% homology at nucleic acid level and 87 to 100% at amino acid level. These clones were classified as  group  1 because of high homology in their overlapped portion. On the contrary, clones C10-11, C10-13, C10-14, C10-15 and C10-35 showed low homologies when compared to the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of HCV and J1, i.e., 69 to 70% homology at nucleic acid level and 75 to 80% at amino acid level. They were therefore classified as  group  2. 
 In addition, when the 369 BP nucleotide and deduced 123-amino acid sequences, indicated as SEQ ID NO. 14, for the C11-C21 clone encoding a structural protein of the virus were compared with the portions overlapped with HCV reported by Houghton et al (WO 90/11089), a nucleic acid homology of 81.8% and an amino acid homology of 87% were found. Also, when compared with HCV clones, HC-J1 and HC-J4, obtained from a Japanese patient (Okamoto et al.; Japan J. Exp. Med., 60, 3, p. 167-177, 1990), homologies of 82.1% and 82.7% at nucleic acid level and 87.8% and 89.4% at amino acid level were shown. Since the same regions among the reported three clones (HCV by Houghton et al. and HC-J1 and HC-J4 by Okamoto et al.) have high homologies of 92.1 to 97.6% at nucleic acid level and 95.5 to 96.7% at amino acid level, it has been found that the clone C11-C21 obtained by the present inventors has a certain distance from the reported clones in terms of homology and therefore is a different group of viral gene therefrom. The remaining 4 clones, C10-E12, C10-E13 and C10-E15, showed homologies of 83 to 93% at nucleic acid level and 82 to 95% at amino acid level when compared with the HCV, HC-J1 and HC-J4, while C10-E24 showed around 63% of homology at nucleic acid level and around 60% of homology at amino acid level. 
 However, no homology was found either at nucleic acid level or amino acid level, when the DNA fragments of the present invention were compared with any DNA fragment encoding non-A non-B hepatitis antigens which have been disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laying-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 89/2576 and 89/124387. 
 Consequently, the clones C10-11, C10-13, C10-14, C10-15, C10-35, C11-C21, and C10-E24 have low homologies with the reported clones both at nucleic acid and amino acid levels. Other clones are also distiguishable from the reported clones. 
 Therefore, the present invention provides a DNA fragment comprising a base sequence which encodes a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide, said polypeptide consisting of the whole or a part of the amino acid sequence which is encoded in the open reading frame and represented by any one of the SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 18. 
 Of course, the base sequences according to the present invention may include any other base sequence which comprises other codons corresponding to each amino acid. 
 Among the aforementioned clones, C11-7, C10-11, C10-13, C10-14, C10-15, C10-16, C10-17, C10-18 and C10-19 were transformed into E. coli HB101 strain and deposited on Jul. 6, 1990 with Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 1-3 Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305, Japan, respectively as E. coil HB101/C11-7 (Accession Number: FERM P-11589), E. coli HB101/ C10-11 (FERM P-11581), E. coli HB101/C10-13 (FERM P-11582), E. coli HB101/C10-14 (FERM P-11583), E. coli HB101/C10-15 (FERM P-11584), E. coli HB101/C10-16 (FERM P-11585), E. coli HB101/C10-17 (FERM P-11586), E. coli HB101/C10-18 (FERM P-11587) and E. coli HB101/C10-19 (FERM P-11588).

______________________________________                                    
 
 As described in the foregoing, the DNA fragments according to the present invention are different from any other prior DNA fragment. Though non-A non-B hepatitis virus is generally divided into two classes, namely    groups    1 and 2, on the basis of the comparison of homology between the clones encoding a non-structural reagion of the hepatitis virus, there is a possibility of existing an intermediate group or even a third group because the virus is very susceptible to mutation in its host cells. It is accordingly difficult to correctly diagnose all the non-A non-B hepatitis patients using an antigen protein prepared from only one kind of DNA fragment. In order to overcome such a problem and to improve an efficiency of the diagnosis, it is necessary to establish such a useful process for the preparation of DNA that a number of effective clones can easily be obtained, and to use several types of clones in combination in diagnosis 
 Expression of non-A non-B Hepatitis Specific Antigenic Polypeptide 
 The present invention also provides an expression vector which is constructed by introducing the above-mentioned DNA fragment into a cloning site downstream of a promoter gene in a vector. 
 Any conventional vector such as plasmid, phage or the like can be used. An expression vector may be constructed by the well-known techniques in the art. The following describes processes for constructing the expression vectors of the invention. 
 Construction of Expression Plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7 
 A flow chart for the construction of the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7 is shown in FIG. 19. 
 Firstly, a plasmid pUC·C11-7 DNA obtained by incorporating the clone C11-7 into pUC119 is digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and ScaI, and the resulting BamHI-ScaI fragment is isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified by a glass powder technique. Separately from this, an expression vector Trp·TrpE DNA is digested with BamHI and ScaI, treated with a bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and then extracted with phenol. The aqueous layer obtained is subsequently subjected to ethanol precipitation to obtain a treated vector DNA. By connecting the vector DNA with the aforementioned C11-7 DNA fragment in the presence of T4 DNA ligase, the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7 is obtained in which the DNA encoding the non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigen is located downstream of a promoter so that transcription of the DNA can be controlled by the promoter. 
 Construction of Expression Plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21 
 A flow chart for the construction of the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21 is shown in FIG. 20. 
 Firstly, a DNA fragment containing a stop codon in its 3' terminal is prepared from a plasmid pUC·C11-C21 DNA which is obtained by incorporating the C11-C21 clone into pUC119, by a gene amplification method (PCR) using two primers (5'-TTACGAATTCATGGGCACGAATCCT-3' (SEQ ID NO:23) and 5'-TTAATCGATGACCTTACCCACATTGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO:24)). By ligating the thus-prepared DNA fragment with pUC118 which is predigested with SmaI, a plasmid pUC118·C11-C21·Sma is obtained. This plasmid is then digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragment is isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified by glass powder technique. Separately from this, an expression vector Trp·TrpE DNA (Japanese Patent Application No. 90/180889) is digested with BamHI and EcoRI, treated with a bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and then extracted with phenol. The aqueous layer obtained is subsequently subjected to ethanol precipitation to obtain a treated vector DNA. By ligating the vector DNA with the aforementioned C11-C21 DNA fragment by the action of T4 DNA ligase in a ligation buffer solution, the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21 is obtained in which the DNA-encoded polypeptide from a structural protein of the non-A non-B hepatitis virus is located downstream of a promoter so that transcription of the DNA can be controlled by the promoter. 
 Other clones can also be made into corresponding expression plasmids by treating each clone with appropriate restriction enzymes and introducing the treated fragment into an expression vector. 
 When a procaryote is used as the host cell, a promoter eligible for use in the present invention may be selected from promoters originated from E. coli, phage and the like, such as tryptophan synthase operon (trp), lactose operon (lac), λ phage P L , λ phage P R  and the like. When an eucaryote such as yeast is used as the host cell, promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and other glycolysis-related enzymes (Holland et al; Biochemistry, 17: 4900, 1978) may be useful. Though not always required, a transcription termination element may preferably be located in the expression vector. 
 The vector may further contain a marker sequence, such as an ampicillin or tetracycline resistance gene, which makes it possible to effect a phenotype selection in transformed cells. 
 The present invention also provides a transformant which is obtained by introducing the expression vector of the invention into a host cell. Microorganisms used commonly in this field, such as E. coli, B. subtilis, a yeast strain and the like, may be used as a host cell. 
 Transformation may be effected by any usually used means for the incorporation of an expression vector into host cells. When a bacterium (for example, E. coli) is used as host cell, a direct incorporation technique with the use of calcium chloride (Mandel, M. and Higa, A; J. Mol. Bio., 53, 159-162, 1970) may be employed. 
 In addition, the polypeptide of the present invention may be produced by inoculating and culturing a suitable host cell carrying the expression vector in an appropriate medium such as ampicillin-containing 2YT medium and then propagating expression cells by subculturing them in an ampicillin-containing phosphate medium. 
 Production and Purification of Recombinant non-A non-B Hepatitis-Specific Antigenic Polypeptide 
 The present invention also provides a process for producing a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide, which comprises the following steps of: 
 constructing a replicable expression vector having inserted therein a DNA fragment of the present invention; 
 obtaining a transformant by introducing said expression vector into a host cell; 
 producing said recombinant polypeptide by culturing said transformant under such conditions that said DNA fragment is expressed; and 
 recovering said recombinant polypeptide. 
 The crude polypeptide product from host cells may be purified by disintegration of the host cells, for example by ultrasonic disintegration, subjecting the disintegrated cells to centrifugation to obtain an insoluble fraction containing a fused polypeptide between TrpE as signal peptide and a polypeptide encoded by cDNA synthesized from a non-A non-B hepatitis virus RNA, extracting the fused polypeptide in a soluble form with a urea-containing buffer, and then purifying obtained by such a expression process, said polypeptide consisting of the whole or part of the amino acid sequence represented by any one of the SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 18. 
 The term "recombinant non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide" as used herein is intended to include a polypeptide itself which is obtained by expressing in a vector a DNA fragment encoding a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigenic polypeptide, and a fused polypeptide obtained by fusing said polypeptide with other peptide such as a signal peptide. 
 Application to Diagnosis of non-A non-B Hepatitis 
 The expressed polypeptide of the present invention was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then allowed to perform antigen-antibody reaction with each of two serum samples from normal persons or non-A non-B hepatitis patients by means of western blotting. As a result, this polypeptide reacted strongly with only the patient's sera as shown in FIGS. 21 and 22. It was therefore confirmed that the expressed polypeptide functions as a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigen. 
 Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method for immunological detection to detect an antibody directed against the non-A non-B hepatitis virus antigen ,which comprises the following steps of: 
 Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method for immunological detection to detect an antibody directed against the non-A non-B hepatitis virus antigen, which comprises the following steps of: 
 incubating a sample possibly containing an anti-non-A non-B hepatitis virus antibody together with at least one recombinant non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigen polypeptide of the present invention under such conditions that the antigen is capable of reacting immunologically with the antibody; and 
 detecting an antigen-antibody complex. 
 Diagnostic effects (positiveness) of the expressed polypeptide TrpE·C11-C21 obtained by expressing the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21, another expressed polypeptide TrpE·C11-7 obtained by expressing the corresponding expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7, and an assay kit of Chiron Corp. (ORTHO HCV Ab ELISA kit) were examined by the conventional enzyme immunoassay through the reaction of the above expressed antigens with a serum sample from a patient who has been diagnosed clinically as being non-A non-B hepatitis. As the results, positiveness of the kit of Chiron Corp. was found to be 69.7% (23/33 cases) while the TrpE·C11-7 which belongs to  group  1 showed a positiveness of 78.8% (26/33 cases). In the case of the expressed polypeptide TrpE·C11-C21, it showed a positiveness of 84.8% (28/33 cases) which is higher than the case of the Chiron's kit. When the expressed polypeptide TrpE·C11-7 as a member of  group  1 and the TrpE·C11-C21 as a member of  group  2 were used in combination, the positiveness increased to 93.9% (30/31 cases; see Table 1 and FIG. 23). 
 Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a combination of the  group  1 and group 2-relating expressed polypeptides as a hepatitis-specific antigen polypeptide for use in the immunological detection. 
 The present invention further provides a method for gene amplification which comprises amplifying a non-A non-B hepatitis virus gene using sense and/or antisense sequence synthesized on the basis of the DNA sequences of the present invention. 
 As the synthetic base sequence for PCR primer, the following single strand DNA sequences may be employed: 
 5'-GGATACACCGGTGACTTTGA-3' (sense, SEQ ID NO. 19); 
 5'-TGCATGCACGTGGCGATGTA-3' (antisense, SEQ ID NO. 20); 
 5'-GATGCCCACTTCCTCTCCCA-3' (sense, SEQ ID NO. 21); and 
 5'-GTCAGGGTAACCTCGTTGGT-3' (antisense, SEQ ID NO. 22), said sequences being sense or antisense of the partial base sequence represented by the SEQ ID NO. 5 for the former two primers and by the SEQ ID NOs. 2, 4, 5 or 13 for the latter two primers. These specified primers are also within a scope of the invention. 
 The single stranded DNA sequences may be synthesized by the usual methods such as phosphorous acid method, phosphotriester method, solid phase method and the like, though the use of a DNA synthesizer is most convenient. 
 When used as a PCR primer, the above single stranded DNA sequences show higher specificity for the  group  2 virus genes than for the  group  1 virus genes (see Tables 2 and 3). 
 Therefore, the present invention also provides a method for detecting the genes from the non-A non-B type hepatitis virus in a fluid sample such as serum, which comprises the following steps of: 
 isolating RNA from the sample, 
 synthesizing cDNA by treating the obtained RNA with a reverse transcriptase, 
 subjecting the obtained cDNA to polymerase chain reaction using at least one the above-mentioned primer; 
 detecting an amplified non-A non-B type hepatitis virus gene. 
 The present invention further provides use of the expressed polypeptides or single stranded DNA sequences for PCR primer of the present invention in the detection of the non-A non-B hepatitis virus. 
 The following examples will be given to describe the present invention in more detail, but it is not intended to limit the invention thereby. 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 Preparation of cDNA Library from Blood Plasma of non-A non-B Hepatitis Patient 
 A cDNA library was prepared using λgt10 and λgt11 phages after preparing an RNA fraction in the following manner from fresh blood plasma pools obtained from several Japanese patients of chronic stage non-A non-B hepatitis. 
 Five liter of blood plasma was diluted with the equal volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, cell debris in the diluted sample was removed by centrifugation at 3,500 g for 20 minutes and then the resulting supernatant was again subjected to centrifugation at 45,000 rpm (about 100,000 g) for 4 hours at a temperature of 4° C. to obtain pellet. The pellet was dissolved, according to the conventional procedure, in 6M guanidium thiocyanate as a protein denaturating agent, layered over a solution of cesium trifluoroacetate, and then subjected to centrifugation using Beckman SW50 rotor at 33,000 rpm for 18 hours at a temperature of 20° C. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA and extracted twice with a solvent system of 1:1 phenol:chloroform, afterwhich the organic layer was mixed with 1/10 volume of 5M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. After allowing to stand the mixture for 2 hours at -20° C., it was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 minutes and the pellet was then dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water to use as an RNA sample. 
 In accordance with the method of Gubler and Hoffman, cDNA was synthesized from the thus obtained RNA sample by means of random primer technique using a commercially available kit (from Amersham or BRL). The cDNA was subsequently treated with EcoRI methylase, ligated with an EcoRI linker or an EcoRI adapter and then cloned into the EcoRI site of λgt10 and λgt 11 phages. The cDNA library thus prepared contained 10 6  to 10 7  PFU of recombinant phages in average. 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Isolation of non-A non-B Hepatitis-Specific cDNA 
 An attempt was made to isolate cDNA specific for non-A non-B hepatitis from the cDNA library prepared in Example 1, by immunoscreening and hybridization assay. 
 Firstly, immunoscreening of λgt11 library was carried out using two serum samples from non-A non-B hepatitis patients which are negative for HBc and HBs antibodies and which contain antibodies specific for the hepatitis-causing virus. Immunoscreening was performed in the usual way by examining specific reaction of a β-galactosidase-fused recombinant peptide with a serum sample of non-A non-B hepatitis (to be referred to as "NANBH" herein after) patient. 
 Cells of E. coli Y1090 strain were mixed with λgt11 cDNA library at a predetermined ratio, plated on an agar medium at an appropriate density, and then incubated at 43° C. for 3 hours to form plaques. Next, the agar plate was covered with a Hybond-C nitrocellulose filter which has been soaked with 10 mM IPTG and the filter-covered plate was incubated again at 37° C. for 3 hours to induce expression. Subsequently, the nitrocellulose filter was subjected to blocking using 3% gelatin solution, reacted with a serum sample of NANBH patient overnight at 4° C., and then, after washing, reacted with a peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgG (goat antibody). A positive signal was found when the resulting filter was reacted with a mixture of diaminobenzidine and H 2  O 2 . This clone, C11-7, did not react with HBc and HBs antibodies. 
 Next, in order to improve efficiency of the screening, the clone C11-7 was re-cloned into pUC119 and made into a probe by random primer method. Using the probe, λgt10 cDNA library was screened by means of hybridization assay. Screening was carried out according to the conventional method by plating 5×10 4  PFU of recombinant phages with E. coli C-600 hfl(-) on an L-plate (150 mm dish). When plaques appeared after overnight incubation of the plate at 37° C., the plate was stored at 4° C. for 1 hour and thereafter the plate was covered with a Hybond-N filter for a period of 30 seconds. The resulting filter was superposed for 1 minute on a filter prewetted with a denaturating solution (0.5M NaOH and 1.5M NaCl), soaked for 5 minutes in a neutralizing solution (0.5M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 1.5M NaCl), washed with 2×SSC, and then dried. The filter was subjected to UV-crosslinking by exposing it to UV rays (304 nm) for 2 minutes. Thereafter, as described below, the resulting filter was subjected to screening by hybridization assay using a  32  P-labeled DNA probe which has been prepared by random primer method from the C11-7 clone obtained by immunoscreening with a serum from NANBH patient. 
 The filter was incubated overnight at 65° C. in 1×SSC, washed twice with 1×SSC at 65° C. (10 minutes for each) and then subjected to autoradiography at -70° C. for the detection of positive plaques. Each positive plaque was transferred into SM buffer and used as a phage stock. Clones obtained were used as marker probe to carry out a series of screening. As the results, 13 clones in total were isolated and designated as C10-11, C10-13, C10-14, C10-15, C10-16, C10-17, C10-18, C10-19, C10-21, C10-22, C10-23 and C10-35. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 Selective Isolation of  Group  2 non-A non-B Hepatitis-Specific cDNA 
 A blood plasma sample which can react only with C10-14 clone was obtained by subjecting fresh blood plasma of a Japanese patient in a chronic phase of the non-A non-B hepatitis to an ELISA-based screening system, using expressed products of the  group  1 cDNA clone C11-7 and the  group  2 cDNA clone C10-14 isolated in Examples 1 and 2. This blood plasma sample was subjected to a gene amplification method (PCR method) using well preserved primers of  group  1 and those of  group  2. PCR method was carried out using Gene Amp™ (DNA Amplification Reagent Kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus) under conditions of: DNA denaturation, 95° C. for 1.5 minutes; annealing, 55° C. for 2 minutes; and DNA synthesis, 70° C. for 3 minutes. Blood plasma samples in which gene amplification was found only with the use of the  group  2 primers under these conditions were pooled for further use. An RNA fraction was prepared from one liter of this fresh blood plasma sample in the same manner as in Example 1, and a cDNA library (referred to as "cDNA library A" hereinafter) was constructed using λgt10 and λgt11 phages. The cDNA library A contained 10 6  to 10 7  PFU of recombinant phages in average. 
 On the other hand, a cDNA library B was constructed using λgt10 phage from five liters of fresh blood plasma samples which have been collected as starting material from several patients of non-A non-B hepatitis and have not been subjected to the ELISA/PCR method, in the same manner as described above. The cDNA library B also contained 10 6  to 10 7  PFU of recombinant phages in average. 
 Cloning of non-A non-B hepatitis-specific cDNA from cDNA library A was carried out by immunoscreening in the same manner as in Example 2, and a positive plaque (clone C11-C21) was obtained. The clone C11-C21 showed no positive reaction with HBc and HBs antibodies. 
 In order to improve efficiency of the screening, the thus obtained clone C11-C21 was re-cloned into pUC119, digested with restriction enzymes, and then made into a  32  P-labeled probe by random primer labeling method in the same manner as in Example 2. Using the probe obtained, the cDNA library B was screened by hybridization assay. After a series of the screening efforts, 4 clones were isolated and named C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 Sequencing of non-A non-B hepatitis-Specific cDNA 
 E. coli cells were infected with the λgt11 or λgt10 phage of each of the 18 clones obtained in Examples 2 and 3 to recover respective phage in a large quantity. DNA was extracted from the phage by the conventional alkali method, digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRI, BamHI or KpnI, and the resulting DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Separately from this, sequencing vectors mp18 and mp19 of M13 phage (Messing, J.; Methods in Enzymology, 101, 20-78) or pUC118 and pUC119 (Vieira, J. and Messing, J.; Methods in Enzymology, 153, 3-11) were digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRI, BamHI or KpnI to obtain linear vector fragments. The cDNA fragment and the vector DNA were ligated together using T4 ligase in a buffer solution, and the resulting reaction product was incorporated into E. coli HB1011 or JM109 strain by transformation or transfection. Resulting E. coli cells were cultured and DNA was recovered by alkali method. Nucleotide sequence of the DNA obtained was determined according to the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. 
 The nucleotide sequences of clones C10-11, C10-13, C10-14, C10-15, C10-16, C10-17, C10-18, C10-19, C10-21, C10-22, C10-23, C10-35, C10-C21, C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15 and the amino acid sequences deduced from these nucleotide sequences are shown in a sequence table as SEQ ID NOs. 1 to 18 and also in FIGS. 1 to 18. 
 On the basis of the comparison of homologies among these sequences and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences disclosed by Houghton et al.(WO89/04669, PCT/JP90/500880) and Miyamura et al(Nuc. Aci. Res., 17, 10367-10372(1989)), clones C11-7, C10-17, C10-18, C10-19, C10-21, C10-22 and C10-23 obtained in Example 2 were classified as  group  1 clone as defined hereabove while clones C10-11, C10-13, C10-14, C10-15 and C10-35 were classified as  group  2 clones. Everyone of these 13 clones encoded non-structural protein of the non-A non-B type hepatitis virus. Moreover, clone C10-C21 in Example 3 was classified as  group  2 from the comparison of homology with the sequences described by Houghton et al (WO90/11089) and Okamoto et al(Japan J. Exp.Med., 60, 3, pp.167-177 (1990)), but classification of the clones C10-E12, C10-E13, C10-E24 and C10-E15 in Example 3 is not still clear. However, it was found that these 5 clones encode the structural protein of non-A non-B hepatitis virus from the comparison of homology with the reported genome of Flavivirus (Protein, Nucleic Acid and Enzyme (Japan), 35 (12), 2117-2127 (1990)). 
 EXAMPLE 5 
 Expression and Purification of Polypeptide Encoded by non-A non-B Type Hepatitis Virus cDNA 
 (i) Construction of Expression Plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7: 
 One of the clones isolated, C11-7, was expressed as a fused polypeptide with TrpE in E. coli under the control of Trp promoter(see FIG. 19). 
 Firstly, 1 μg of a plasmid pUC·C11-7 DNA which has been obtained by incorporating the C11-7 clone into pUC119 was digested by incubating it at 37° C. for 1 hour in 20 μl of a restriction enzyme reaction solution [150 mM NaCl, 6 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 15 units of BamHI enzyme and 15 units of ScaI enzyme]. Thereafter, a BamHI-ScaI fragment of about 700 bp was obtained by subjecting the resulting reaction solution to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the fragment was purified by glass powder method (Gene Clean™, Bio-101). 
 One μg of Trp·TrpE DNA which is an expression vector was digested by incubating it at 37° C. for 1 hour in 20 μl of a reaction solution [150 mM NaCl, 6 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 15 units of BamHI enzyme and 15 units of ScaI enzyme]. After adding 39 μl of water, the resulting reaction solution was heat-treated at 70° C. for 5 minutes, mixed with 1 μl (250 U/μl) of a bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and then incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. The reaction solution was subsequently extracted with phenol, the aqueou layer was subjected to ethanol precipitation followed by drying of the precipitate. One μg of the BamHI-ScaI-treated vector DNA obtained and the above C11-7 DNA fragment was added to 5 μl of 10×ligase buffer [660 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 66 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM ATP] and 1 μl of T4 DNA ligase (350 U/μl), and water was then added to the mixture to 50 μl of the final volume. Thereafter, the thus prepared mixture was incubated overnight at 16° C. to complete ligation. 
 E. coli HB101 strain was transformed with 10 μl of the resulting reaction solution. Competent E. coli strain for use in the transformation was prepared by calcium chloride technique [Mandel, M. and Higa, A.; J. Moi. Biol., 53, 159-162 (1970)]. The transformed E. coli strain cells were spread on an LB-plate (1% trypton, 0.5% yeast extracts, 0.5% NaCl and 1.5% agar) containing 25 μg/ml of ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37° C. One loopful of each colony grown on the plate was transferred into a liquid LB medium containing 25 μg/ml of ampicillin and cultured overnight at 37° C. Cells in 1.5 ml of the cultured medium were collected by centrifugation, and Miniprep of plasmid DNA was carried out by alkali method (Maniatis et al; Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 1982). One μg of the plasmid DNA obtained was digested at 37° C. for 1 hour in 20 μl of a reaction solution [150 mM NaCl, 6 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 15 units of BamHI and 15 units of ScaI]. Thereafter, the digested solution was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain an expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7 which can produce the 700 bp BamHI-ScaI fragment. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli HB101 strain and deposited on Jul. 6, 1990 with Fermentation Research Institute, 1-3 Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305, Japan, under the Accession Number FERM P-11590 (named E. coli HB101/Trp·TrpE·C11-7). This deposition was subsequently converted on Jun. 13, 1991 to an international deposition under Budapest Treaty at the same international depository authority, under the new Accession Number FERM BP-3443. 
 (ii) Expression and Purification of Polypeptide Encoded by Clone C11-7: 
 E. coli HB101 strain transformed with the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-7 was inoculated into 3 ml of a liquid 2YT medium (1.6% trypton, 1% yeast extracts and 0.5% NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and cultured at 37° C. for 9 hours. One ml portion of the cultured broth was inoculated into 100 ml of a liquid M9-CA medium (0.6% Na 2  HPO 4 , 0.5% KH 2  PO 4 , 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% NH 4  Cl, 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.5% casamino acid and 0.2% glucose) containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and cultured at 37° C. for 21 hours. A 18-ml portion of the resulting culture broth was then inoculated into 1.2 1 of the M9-CA medium and cultured at 37° C. When turbidity at OD 600  of the culture broth reached 0.3, indole acrylate was added to a final concentration of 40 mg/l, and the culturing was continued for additional 16 hours. Cells collected from the final culture broth by centrifugation were suspended in 20 ml of buffer A [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA and 30 mM NaCl] and the cell suspension was again subjected to centrifugation to obtain 2.6 g of expressed cells. The thus obtained cells were suspended in 10 ml of the buffer A, disintegrated by ultrasonic treatment, and then subjected to centrifugation to obtain an insoluble fraction containing a fused polypeptide of TrpE with a polypeptide which is encoded by the non-A non-B type hepatitis virus cDNA. The fused polypeptide in the insoluble fraction was solubilized and extracted using 10 ml of the buffer A containing 9M urea. Thereafter, the solubilized extract was subjected to an S-Shepharose ion exchange column chromatography with an NaCl gradient of from 0M to 0.5M to purify the fused polypeptide. 
 (iii) Construction of Expression Plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21: 
 The clone C11-C21 was expressed as a fused polypeptide with TrpE in E. coli under the control of a promoter (see FIG. 20). 
 Firstly, 1 ng of plasmid pUC·C11-C21DNA which has been obtained by incorporating C11-C21 clone into pUC119 was subjected to PCR method using two primers (5'-TTACGAATTCATGGGCACGAATCCT-3' (SEQ ID NO:23) and 5'-TTAATCGATGACCTTACCCACATTGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO:24)). PCR method was carried out using Gene Amp™ kit (DNA Amplification Reagent Kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus) under reaction conditions of: DNA denaturation, 95° C. for 1.5 minutes; annealing, 50° C. for 2 minutes; and DNA synthesis, 70° C. for 3 minutes. DNA fragments thus obtained were separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by glass powder technique. Separately from this, pUC118 was digested with a restriction enzyme SmaI and then ligated with the DNA fragment obtained by PCR method in a buffer solution containing T4 ligase to obtain a plasmid pUC118·C11-C21·Sma. One μg of the plasmid DNA obtained was digested at 37° C. for 1 hour in a restriction enzyme reaction solution [150 mM NaCl, 6 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 15 units of EcoRI enzyme and 15 units of BamHI enzyme]. Thereafter, the resulting reaction mixture was subjected to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis to isolate an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of about 380 bp which was then purified by glass powder technique (Gene Clean™, Bio-101). 
 Next, ligation and transformation were carried out substantially in the same manner as in the aforementioned procedure (i) except that restriction digestion of the expression vector Trp·TrpE DNA was carried out using EcoRI and BamHI instead of BamHI and ScaI. Thereafter, an expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21 which can produce the EcoRI-BamHI fragment of about 380 bp was selected by agarose gel electrophoresis purification. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli HB101 strain and deposited on Dec. 11, 1990 with Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, the same address, under the Accession Number FERM P-11893 (named E. coli HB101/Trp·TrpE·C11-C21). The deposition was also subsequently converted on Jun. 17, 1991 to an international deposition under Budapest Treaty at the same international depository authority, under the Accession Number FERM BP-3451. 
 (iv) Expression and Purification of Polypeptide Encoded by Clone C11-C21: 
 Expression and purification of a fused polypeptide were carried out substantially in the same manner as in the aforementioned procedure (ii), except that the expression plasmid Trp·TrpE·C11-C21 obtained by the above procedure (iii) was used instead of Trp·TrpE·C11-7. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 Measurement of Anti-non-A non-B Type Hepatitis Virus Antibody in Serum from non-A non-B Hepatitis Patient 
 (i) Measurement by Western Blotting: 
 The expressed product obtained and purified in Example 5 was subjected in turn to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [Laemmli; Nature, 277, 680 (1970)] and to blotting on a nitrocellulose filter (Bio-Rad, Trans-blot) in usual way. The filter was blocked with a 3% gelatin solution and then reacted with each serum samples from normal persons or non-A non-B hepatitis patients. After washing, the resulting filter was reacted with a peroxidase-labeled human IgG (goat antibody). Thereafter, the filter was washed again and soaked in a solution containing diaminobenzidine as reaction substrate to confirm color development. 
 The results are shown in FIGS. 21 and 22. In FIG. 21, the expressed polypeptide TrpE·C11-7 (group 1) obtained in Example 5-(ii) was used as antigen, and in FIG. 22, the expressed polypeptide TrpE·C11-C21 (group 2) in Example 5-(iv) was used. In each case, no reaction was observed with a normal serum sample, but a strong reaction with a patient's serum sample was found with a specific band. 
 (ii) Measurement by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA): 
 ELISA can be used as a means to make diagnosis of a large number of serum samples as compared to the case of western blotting method. ELISA was carried out as follows: 
 A purified antigen sample was diluted with PBS(-) to a concentration of 5 μg/ml and fixed to a micro-plate at 4° C. or room temperature. After washing several times with a washing solution, a diluted serum sample to be detected was added to the resulting plate and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. or room temperature. After washing, peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgG (goat antibody) was added and incubated at 37° C. or room temperature to complete the reaction. After washing several times, 50 μl of a diaminobenzidine solution was added and incubated at 37° C. to develop color. Thereafter, the coloring reaction was stopped with 2M H 2  SO 4  and the color was measured by a colorimeter. 
 Positive ratios in the case of the use of the expressed polypeptide antigens, TrpE·C11-7 (group 1) and TrpE·C11-C21 (group 2), of the present invention were compared with the case of the use of a commercially available kit of Chiron Corp. (Ortho HCV Ab ELISA Test). As shown in Table 1, the use of the Chiron's kit resulted in 69.7% of the positive ratio, while positive ratios in the case of the use of the TrpE·C11-7 and TrpE·C11-C21 were 78.8% and 84.8%, respectively Moreover, the positive ratio increased to 98.9% (30 of 31 cases) when these two expressed polypeptides of the present invention were used in combination (see FIG. 23). 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 Detection of non-A non-B Type  Hepatitis Virus Group  2 Gene in Blood Plasma from non-A non-B Hepatitis Patient by RT-PCR 
 RT-PCR was carried out as follows: 
 To 100 μl of a blood plasma sample collected from a non-A non-B hepatitis patient was added 300 μl of a 6M GTC solution (6M guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% sarcosyl and 0.2M 2-mercaptoethanol), and the mixture was stirred. To this were further added 40 μl of 2M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 400 μl of phenol and 80 μl of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1), and then thoroughly stirred. Aqueous solution layer separated from the mixture-was mixed with isopropyl alcohol and then subjected to centrifugation. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using the pellet as a source of RNA. For the cDNA synthesis, an RNase inhibitor and a reverse transcriptase were added to a reaction solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% gelatin, 1 mM each dNTP, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 100 pmole each primer, and the mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours to complete the reaction. Then, PCR was carried out using the cDNA obtained. In order to increase sensitivity and specificity for the detection of bands, a two step PCR method was employed, that is, first PCR using two primers (lst step PCR) and subsequent PCR using two primers which exist inside the first PCR product (2nd step PCR). For the PCR reaction, each amplification cycle was carried out using 100 μl of a reaction solution containing cDNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% gelatin, 2 mM each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl 2  and 50 pmol each primer, under reaction conditions of: denaturation, 94° C. for 1.5 minutes; annealing, 50° C. for 2 minutes; and chain elongation, 70° C. for 2 minutes. The amplification was repeated 35 cycles. Effects of several primers were evaluated. As the results, it was found that the group 2-specific DNA fragments are capable of being detected by the use of the following 4 primers: 
 1st step PCR 
 kk21: 5'-GGATACACCGGTGACTTTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:19) 
 kk22: 5'-TGCATGCACGTGGCGATGTA-3' (SEQ ID NO:20) 
 2nd step PCR 
 kk26: 5'-GATGCCCACTTCCTCTCCCA-3' (SEQ ID NO:21) 
 kk27: 5'-GTCAGGGTAACCTCGTTGGT-3' (SEQ ID NO:22) 
 By applying these 4 primers to the PCR method, a DNA fragment of 206 bp can be detected. As a control, primers were synthesized from the base sequence of J1 and detection of  group  1 DNA fragments was attempted. Results of the PCR from blood plasma samples of non-A non-B hepatitis patient are shown in Table 2. 
 It was known that DNA fragments from the non-A non-B hepatitis virus can be detected by both the  PCRs using group  1 primers (i.e.,  group  1 PCR) and  group  2 primers (i.e.,  group  2 PCR), and therefor two samples, Nos. 3 and 5, which are considered to include both groups 1- and 2-relating viruses were sequenecd for their vital genes. As shown in Table 3, when nucleotide sequences of DNA fragments obtained by  group  2 PCR were compared with C10-13 which is a  group  2 clone, homologies of 85% and 88% were observed, indicating effective detection of  group  2 genes. When these two nucleotide sequences were compared with the  aforementioned group  1 clone J1 (Miyamura et al, supra), only 64.8% and 68% homologies were observed. Results of the homology evaluation indicate that the primers used in the  group  2 PCR can selectively detect  group  2 viral genes.

 As seen from the foregoing examples, the present invention has the following advantages: 
 The cDNA sequences according to the present invention are specific to non-A non-B hepatitis, and polypeptides which are produced by incorporating these genes into a protein expression system in microbial host cells such as E. coli can react immunologically with sera samples from a number of non-A non-B hepatitis patients, whereby a kit for diagnosing non-A non-B hepatitis is capable of preparing with markedly high sensitivity and judging accuracy. Also, it is possible to make diagnosis of this disease using said sequences as a probe directly or other probes with higher specificity synthesized on the basis of the sequences. In addition, not only diagnosis of the disease but also isolation of non-A non-B hepatitis-specific genes can be accomplished by employing a gene amplification method (PCR method).
