Genes of chemokine subfamilies locate on a same chromosome in a cluster, for example, ax-chemokine genes locate on the human chromosome 4ql2-21 and P-chemokine genes exist on the 30 human chromosome 17qll-32 and the mouse chromosome 11. Some chemokines have biological activities such as HIV-inhibitory action, immunoregulatory action, leukocyte migration or inhibitory action against division of hematopoietic stem cells(see: Cocchi, F. et al., Science, 35 270:1811(1995); Wolpe, S.D. et al., J. Exp. Med., WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 2 167:570(1988); Graham, G.J. et al., Nature, 344:442(1990); Broxmeyer, H.E. et al., Blood, 76:1110(1990); Youn, B.-S. et al., J. Immunol., 155:2661-2667 (1995)). Also, chemokines bind to transmembrane domain of G 5 protein-coupled receptors to activate leukocytes and some of the receptors are also used as coreceptors in the course of HIV-1 infection(see: Oh, K.-O. et al., J. Immunol., 147:2978(1991); Alkabatih, G. et al., Science, 272:1955(1996)). For example, among 8 subtypes of P 10 chemokine(CC chemokine) receptor, i.e., CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7 and CCR8, four subtypes of CCR4, CCR6, CCR7 and CCR8 show a high affinity to one substance while CCR1, CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5 have a binding affinity to various chemokines. 15 So far, more than nine chemokines belonging to chemokine subfamily have been found (.see: Wilson, S. D. et al., J. Exp. Med., 171:1301(1990); Modi, W.S. et al., Hum. Genet., 84:185(1990)). Among them, a murine MRP-1 ("mMRP-1", MIP(macrophage inflammatory protein)-related protein-1 or 20 C10) (.see: Orlofsky, A. et al. , Cell Regul. , 2: 403 (1991) ) , a murine MRP-2 ("mMRP-2") (.ee: Youn, B.-S. et al., J. Immunol., 155:2661 (1995) ), and a human Lkn-1 (Leukotactin-1) (.see: Youn, B.-S. et al., J. Immunol., 159:5201 (1997) ) are distinguished from the rest of P-chemokines in the senses that they have 25 two extra cysteine residues, thereby forming the third disulfide bond, and their N-terminal regions are very long. Based on the findings, they are classified into C6 1 chemokines. Meanwhile, it was observed that expression of Lkn-1 from 30 recombinant yeast cells such as Pichia pastoris("E. pastoris") results in a recombinant protein with a smaller size than expected for intact Lkn-1 of 92 amino acid residues. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this smaller form is consistent with that of truncation form Lkn-l in which 26 35 amino acids of N-terminus are deleted. Similar truncation WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 3 of N-terminus has been reported for MPIF-i (Myeloid Progenitor Inhibitory Factor-1) which is closely related to Lkn-l in terms of the presence of the extra pair of cysteine residues and the unusually long N-terminus (.ee: Macphee C.H. et al., 5 J. Immunol., 161:6273(1998)). In this connection, it was suggested that the truncation is correlated with the increase of the biological activity. Under the circumstances, there are strong reasons for exploring and developing the truncated variant of Lkn-1, 10 since the shorter version may have enhanced biological activity as with MPIF-1 and advantages in mass production. When compared with the native molecule, Lkn-1, the truncated variant of Lkn-l may have improved potential biological activity as a drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or 15 for the protection of bone marrow stem cells during chemotherapy or radiotherapy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 20 The present inventors isolated a truncated form of Lkn-l from the culture media of 2. pastoris harboring the gene for Lkn-1, and discovered that the truncated Lkn-l protein indeed has enhanced biological activity as compared with the native Lkn-1. Further, they constructed a cDNA for the truncated 25 form, expressed the said mutant cDNA in a recombinant P. pastoris, and showed the expressed recombinant protein inhibits colony formation and proliferation of myeloid stem cell and progenitor cell in vivo. Hereinafter, the said truncated form protein and the recombinant protein thereof 30 are referred to as "shLkn-1"(short version of human leukotactin-1) and "recombinant shLkn-l", respectively. The first object of the invention is, therefore, to provide shLkn-1 which has an enhanced biological activity as 35 compared with the intact Lkn-1. 
 WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 4 The second object of the invention is to provide an expression vector comprising a cDNA for the said shLkn-1 and a recombinant microorganism transformed with the vector. The third object of the invention is to provide a process 5 for preparing a recombinant shLkn-1 from the said microorganism. The fourth object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for the antibody production, the treatment during HIV-1 infection, the protection of bone 10 marrow stem cells during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the inhibition of leukemia.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 25 The present inventors have isolated Lkn-1 cDNA from the cDNA library prepared from a human monocytic THP-1 cell line activated by interleukin-4(IL-4). The Lkn-l cDNA thus cloned was inserted into a vector pPIC9 to construct an 30 expression vector for Lkn-1, pPM2, and introduced into E. pastoris to express the recombinant Lkn-1. The recombinant Lkn-1 was expressed and secreted from the host cells into growth media upon induction with methanol. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed 35 that the size of the recombinant protein was smaller than that WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 6 expected for mature Lkn-1. The apparently truncated form was purified with two steps of ion exchange column chromatography by using SP-Sepharose column. N-terminal sequencing has proven that the said protein is generated by the truncation 5 of the N-terminal fragment of 26 amino acid residues from the mature Lkn-1 and hence the truncated form was designated as shLkn-1. The recombinant shLkn-1 was a stronger agonist at CCR1 than recombinant Lkn-1. To construct an expression system for stable and highly 10 efficient expression of recombinant shLkn-1 in E. pastors, the present inventors first generated a DNA fragment encoding shLkn-1 by the polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and then inserted the DNA fragment into the expression vector pPIC9. The expression vector pPM2-HF thus constructed was 15 transformed into a host cell of E. pastors and a recombinant strain capable of high level expression of shLkn-1 was selected. Recombinant shLkn-1 was expressed and secreted from host cells into culture media upon induction with methanol. 20 The recombinant shLkn-1 purified from the culture media is a stronger agonist of CCR1 than recombinant Lkn-l and inhibits colony formation, and cell proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in vivo. The recombinant shLkn-1 of the invention showing the 25 characteristics mentioned above can be used for the antibody production, the treatment during HIV-1 infection, the protection of bone marrow stem cells during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and the inhibition of leukemia. 30 The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention. Example 1: Identification of a truncated form of Lkn-1 35 WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 7 In order to express Lkn-1 in P. pastors, an expression vector pPM2 depicted in Figure 1 was linearized with a restriction enzyme StuI and used for transformation of P. pastoris GS115 host cells by the electroporation method. 5 Transformants of E. pastors on selective agar plate were inoculated in 50 ml Minimal Dextrose (MD) media and grown at 300C overnight. The seed culture was centrifuged and the harvested cells were inoculated into Minimal Methanol(MM) media. The cells were grown at 300C with vigorous shaking 10 to an OD 600 of 1 and the expression and secretion of recombinant Lkn-l from P. pastoris were induced by addition of 100% methanol to the culture media to a final concentration of 0. 5% every 24 hours. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and calcium mobilization assay with HEK293 cell line which was 15 transfected with CCR1 receptor, a recombinant clone . pastoris/pPM2 with the highest expression of Lkn-1 was selected. High level of recombinant Lkn-l expression was achieved by high density cell culture of recombinant P. pastoris/pPM2 20 using a BioFloIII fermenter(New Brunswick Scientific, U.S.A.) and a DO-stat control strategy. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the culture broth from the fermentation revealed that the mature form of Lkn-1 with 92 amino acid residues appeared to be converted to a form with 25 a smaller size as shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2, Lkn-1, SM and shLkn-1 represent mature form of Lkn-1, molecular weight size marker and smaller size Lkn-1, respectively. The said recombinant protein with the apparently smaller size was purified from the culture broth by consecutive ion 30 exchange column chromatographic steps by using SP-Sepharose column. The culture broth was diluted 3-fold with 20mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and applied to a SP-Sepharose column. After washing the column with the same buffer containing 0. 1M NaCl, the truncated form of Lkn-1 was eluted from the column 35 with the sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3MNaCl. 
 WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 8 The pool of the fractions containing the said protein as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was diluted 4-fold with 20mM sodium phosphate, pH 7. 4, and applied to a SP-Sepharose column. Unbound portion was washed away 5 from the column with 20mM sodium phosphate, pH 7. 4, containing 0.1M NaCl. The truncated form of Lkn-1 was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.25 to 0.3M in the same buffer. The purity of the said protein was over 95% as determined by analytical reversed-phase HPLC. 10 The first amino acid of the purified recombinant protein was histidine as determined by Edman degradation amino acid sequencing, confirming a truncation of 26 amino acid residues from the amino terminus of Lkn-1. The molecular weight of the said protein measured by mass spectrometric analysis was 15 also consistent with the truncation of 26 residues from the mature Lkn-l. Hence the truncated Lkn-1 was named shLkn 1(short version of human leukotactin-1). Biological activity of shLkn-1 was compared to that of mature Lkn-l by calcium mobilization assay using HEK293 cell 20 line expressing CCR1. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with HBSS(10mM HEPES(pH 7.4), 0.8mM MgCl 2 , and 1.8mM CaCl 2 ) and loaded in HBSS containing 2 p 1 M FURA-2/AM for 45 min at 37"C in the dark. Cells were washed twice in HBSS and resuspended at 1x10 6 /ml in HBSS (pH 25 7.4). 2 ml of cell suspension was placed in a stirred, water-jacketed cuvette at 37'C and excited at 340nm. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 510 nm before and after addition of agonists, and the data were presented as the relative fluorescence level. As shown in Figures 3(A) and 30 3(B), the amplitude of fluorescence change evoked with 10ng/ml of shLkn-1 was even greater than that evoked with 100ng/ml of mature Lkn-1, indicating that shLkn-l was far more active than Lkn-l in stimulating intracellular calcium mobilization through CCR1. 35 WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 9 Example 2: Construction of an expression vector for shLkn-1, pPM2-HF The expression vector pPM2-HF for the production of 5 shLkn-1 in P-. pastoris was constructed in accordance with the strategy shown in Figure 4. A plasmid for the expression of shLkn-1 in a yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed and designated as pSCM2-HF whose map is also shown in Figure 4. A DNA fragment corresponding to a fusion protein 10 of the secretion signal sequence of yeast a-factor and shLkn-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pSCM2-HF plasmid as a template, a set of forward and reverse primers, and Ex Taq DNA polymerase(TaKaRa, Japan): 15 forward primer: 5'-GCGCGCTCATGAGATTTCCTTCAATTTTTAC-3' (SEQ ID NO:3) reverse primer: 20 5'-GCGCGCGAATTCCTATTATATTGAGTAGGGCTTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO:4) The DNA fragment thus amplified was ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector(Promega, U.S.A.) to make the pGEM-HFplasmid. In 25 order to construct the pPM2-HF plasmid, a three-fragment ligation was carried out. The pGEM-HF plasmid was digested with PstI/EcoRI and a fragment thus generated and containing the shLkn-1 coding region fused to a part of the signal sequence was isolated. The plasmid pPIC9(Invitrogen, 30 U.S.A.) was digested separately with either SacI/EcoRI or SacI/PstI from which a fragment of 7009 base pairs and a fragment of 767 base pairs were isolated, respectively. The recombinant plasmid thus constructed was confirmed by restriction digestion mapping and DNA sequencing and 35 designated as pPM2-HF. The nucleotide sequence of shLkn- WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 10 1 coding region(SEQ. ID NO: 1) and the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence(SEQ. ID NO: 2) are provided in the Sequence Listing. The expression vector pPM2-HF was linearized with a restriction enzyme StuI and 5 introduced into 2. pastors. The recombinant plasmid pPM2-HF permits expression and secretion of recombinant shLkn-1 from P. pastoris. A transformant capable of high level expression of shLkn-1 was selected as described in Example 1. The transformant thus prepared was designated as 10 GS115:pPM2-HF and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms(KCCM, 361-221, Hongje-1-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-091, Republic of Korea), an international depository authority as accession No. KCCM 10159, on May 13, 1999. 15 Example 3: Expression and purification of recombinant shLkn-1 from E. pastoris Expression in E. pastors and purification from the 20 culture media of recombinant shLkn-1 were carried out analogously as in Example 1. Figure 5 shows the purified recombinant shLkn-1 analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, where lane 1 is fermenatation culture broth; lane 2 is 1st SP-Sepharose pool; lane 3 is 2nd SP-Sepharose 25 pool; and, lane 4 is molecular weight size marker. Example 4: Analysis of calcium flux in HEK293 cell line expressing CCR1 chemokine receptor 30 It was shown that Lkn-1 can activate a cell line expressing CCR1 or CCR3 chemokine receptors. In order to compare biological activities of shLkn-1 and mature Lkn-1, dose dependencies of calcium mobilization with varied concentrations of either protein were carried out using 35 HEK293 cell line expressing CCR1 chemokine receptor, which WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 11 was analyzed in a similar manner as in Example 1. As shown in Figure 6, the relative calcium responses depending on concentrations of shLkn-1 (-0-) and Lkn-l(-*-) showed that the recombinant shLkn-1 is a stronger agonist against CCR1 5 than recombinant Lkn-1. Example 5: Inhibition of proliferation of myeloid cells by the recombinant shLkn-1 in vivo 10 The biological activity of shLkn-1 was evaluated in vivo. That is, the purified shLkn-l was intravenously injected into C3H/HeJ mice and absolute numbers of granulocyte macrophage("CFU-GM"), erythroid("BFU-E") and multipotential progenitor cells("CFU-GEMM") and their 15 proliferation rates were determined in bone marrow as follows: C3H/HeJmice were injected through the tail vein with either 0.1ml of sterile pyrogen-free saline or 10pg of purified shLkn-1 diluted in sterile pyrogen-free saline. At the same time, separate group of C3H/HeJ mice were injected 20 with either 10ptg of MIP-la (Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-laL) or 10ptg of MIP-l(Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1) as a positive and negative control, respectively, for the myelosuppressive activity. After 24h from the injection, myeloid cells of low density were prepared from 25 bone marrow of femur of the mice. Then, CFU-GM was plated on 0.3% agar culture medium, and stimulated by 10% PWM mouse spleen cell-conditioned medium. Similarly, BFU-E and CFU GEMM were plated on 0.9% methylcellulose culture medium, respectively, and stimulated by 1 unit of rhEPO, 30 0.lmmole/hemin and 1% PWM mouse spleen cell-conditioned medium. In this connection, the bone marrow cells were plated at a concentration of 7.5xlO 4 cells/ml. After the stimulation, the cells were cultured in a BNP-210 incubator (Tabai ESPEC Corp., U.S.A.) under an environment of 5% CO 2 and 5% 02, and 35 number of colonies was counted after 5 to 7 days of WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 12 incubation(see: Figure 7(A)). On the other hand, proliferation rates, i.e., cycling rates of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM were determined as percentage of the cells in S phase of cell cycle by measuring the proportion of progenitors 5 in DNA synthesis(i.e., S-phase of cell cycle) by the aid of tritiated thymidine (50 p Ci/ml, 20Ci/mmol) killing technique, which is based on in vitro calculation of reduction in the number of colonies formed after pulse exposure of cells to hot tritiated thymidine for 20min as compared with a 10 comparable amount of cold thymidine (see: Figure 7 (B) ) . Figures 7 (A) and 7 (B) revealed that shLkn-1 rapidly decreased numbers of colonies by myeloid stem/progenitor cells and their proliferation rate, i.e., cell cycling rate in the bone marrow. The overall cell cycling rate was completely 15 abolished by shLkn-1. On the other hand, the nucleated cellularity in bone marrow, spleen and blood were assessed, and found to be not significantly affected as compared with control. These effects of shLkn-1 on proliferation of 20 stem/progenitor cells strongly suggested that: shLkn-1 has a potential clinical use in protecting normal hematopoietic cells from cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs or radiation. Acute toxicity test 25 Acute toxicity was examined using 6-week-old SD(Sprague-Dawley) rats. lml of PBS(phosphate buffered saline) containing shLkn-1 (dose: 60mg/kg) was intravenously injected into 10 rats and the rats were observed. As aresult, 30 all tested animals were survived, and there was no striking symptom or other toxic effect. shLkn-1 did not elicit any toxic effect when injected to rats within the range of 60mg/kg, thus proved to be safe material for parenteral administration. 35 WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 13 shLkn-1 may be used as an active ingredient of a parmaceutical composition for the antibody production, the treatment during HIV-1 infection, the protection of bone marrow stem cells during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and 5 the inhibition of leukemia, in a free form or in a formulation with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for oral, intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Orally, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated in the form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders and the like. In 10 addition, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise additives such as surfactants, paraplasms, coloring agents, stabilizers, buffers, suspensions, isotonics or other conventional additives, and inorganic or organic carriers to formulate solid, semi-solid or liquid-type preparation. 15 The effective dose of pharmaceutical composition provided by the present invention is variable depending on the way of treatment, administration or the type of disease, the age of patient and the duration of administration. In the administration via vein and muscle, the effective dose 20 ranges from 0.1 to 5mg/kg, and in the case of the oral administration, the range falls into 1.0 to 30mg/kg. As clearly illustrated and demonstrated as above, the present invention provides a variant of Lkn-1 with enhanced 25 biological activity as compared to the parent molecule. Amino acid sequencing revealed that: the variant is a truncated form of Lkn-l which is generated bymissing 26 amino acid residues from the amino terminus of Lkn-1; hence, shLkn-1 contains 66 amino acids whose molecular weight estimates 30 about 7,200 daltons. Recombinant shLkn-1 which is expressed, secreted from E. pastors and purified to near homogeneity is shown to be more active than mature Lkn-1. Recombinant shLkn-1 inhibits colony formation and cell proliferation in vivo, which suggests that it can be used as a potential drug 35 for the antibody production, the treatment during HIV-1 WO 00/73456 PCT/KR99/00262 14 infection, the protection of bone marrow stem cells during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the inhibition of leukemia. Further, it was also determined that the recombinant shLkn-1 may provide simplicity to the production and storage of the 5 said protein as compared with the parent molecule Lkn-1.
