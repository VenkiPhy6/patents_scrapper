 The polypeptide that seitan is relevant with seitan 
 Have nothing to do with concrete form, compositions of the present invention can reduce the cellular uptake of the seitan polypeptide relevant with seitan.The polypeptide that seitan is relevant with seitan is storage protein (storage protein) main in grain diet.Seitan is found in Semen Tritici aestivi.The albumen hordein of tight association and secalin are found in Fructus Hordei Vulgaris and rye (Secale cereale L.) respectively.Find the gene of the protein that hundreds of coding seitan is relevant with seitan.Except nutrition attribute, seitan is determining to play an important role in the distinctive baking quality of Semen Tritici aestivi by affect the water absorbing power of dough, cohesion, viscosity and elasticity.Seitan is in fact the complex of two peptide species components, is divided into: solvable gliadin and the glutenin of indissoluble based on its dissolubility in aquiferous ethanol.Two kinds of components are all become to be grouped into by the multiple related protein being feature with high glutamine and proline content. 
 Gliadin is molecular weight (MW) about 28,000-55, and the monomeric protein of 000, its isoelectric point, IP is about pH3.0-4.0.There is the gliadin polypeptide of 4 types: α-gliadin, β-gliadin, γ-gliadin and ω-gliadin.The exemplary aminoacid sequence of α-gliadin is found in GenBank:Gl:7209265 (Semen Tritici aestivi (Triticum aestivum) 290 aminoacid, SEQ ID NO:7); Gl:7209263 (Semen Tritici aestivi 269 aminoacid, SEQ ID NO:8); Gl:376341626 (Semen Tritici aestivi 210 aminoacid, SEQ ID NO:9); Gl:282721198 (Semen Tritici aestivi, 313 aminoacid, SEQ ID NO:10). 
 Glutenin is larger multimeric protein, MW scope from about 100,00 to being greater than 10,000,000, average MW about 3,000,000.The isoelectric point, IP scope of glutenin is about 6.5-7.0.After disulfide bond reduction, the dissolubility that the glutenin subunit of generation demonstrates in aquiferous ethanol is similar to gliadin.Based on primary structure, glutenin subunit is divided into high molecular (HMW) subunit (MW=67,000-88,000) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) subunit (MW=32,000-35,000).Gliadin, glutenin, hordein and secalin have high proline content and glutamine content.High proline content makes these albumen can not by the gastric enzyme in people's intestinal, pancreatin and brush border enzyme adequate proteins hydrolytic digestion, because these enzymes lack prolyl endopeptidase activity.This to cause in small intestinal accumulation to have the relative large peptide section (length reaches 50 aminoacid) of high proline content and glutamine content. 
 The concrete aminoacid sequence of gliadin can be different, but they all contain the T-cell epitope that can start and participate in the pathogenetic immunne response of celiac disease.The special t cell response of these seitans in small intestinal finally causes playing an important role in the inflammatory response of the significant atrophy of intestinal villi and crypts hypertrophy in generation.Special natural seitan peptide can be attached to HLA-DQ2/8, and the dependency of this HLA type and celiac disease is maximum.Described HLA combines and lamina propria cd4 t cell can be induced to reply, and then damages mucous membrane of small intestine.Tissue injury starts secretion wound healing enzyme tTG (tTG).But tTG also can make seitan peptide demidizate.Desamidation changes the glutamine residue of neutrality into electronegative glutaminic acid residue.These deamidating peptides have the binding affinity to HLA-DQ2/8 significantly increased relative to not deamidating peptide.Described process causes the antigen presentation of the gliadin strengthened.The combination of deamidating peptide activates the special CD4+T-accessory cell 1 of seitan in lamina propria (Th1) further, and it is promoted then, and intraepithelial lymphocyte increases, crypts hypertrophy, cause the generation of the cytokine of Villus atrophy and produce the expansion of B cell of antibody of gliadin and tTG. 
 Multiple t cell epitope motif has been identified in α-gliadin and γ-gliadin and glutenin.Wherein most T cell identification demonstrating enhancing after demidizate.In addition, celiac patients is usually responsive to exceeding a kind of seitan peptide.The dependency the most significant with celiac disease representing and identify up to now although DQ2/8 interacts, non-immunogenic seitan peptide also has impact to inherent immunity system. 
 Gliadin peptide P31-43 and P31-49 be not usually by T cell identification.These peptides can induce the innate immune response in abdominal cavity mucosa.It is ripe that P31-43 peptide can delay endocytosis film bubble, therefore reduces EGF-R ELISA (EGFR) and degrade and extend EGFR activation.The EGFR extended activates to have demonstrated and can promote that the cell proliferation in abdominal cavity crypts enterocyte and cultured cells system and actin are modified.Once enter the enterocyte of intestinal or namely people's enterocyte system CaCo2, P31-43 interact with early stage endocytosis film bubble, reduce its mobility and delay it and grow into late endosomal. 
 Different seitan peptides participates in celiac disease process.Biologically active peptide from α-gliadin has two groups.Peptide group containing serine demonstrates the cytotoxicity of essence, and has immunoreactive ability in startup celiac patients containing the group of threonine.Activity containing serine peptide is relevant to the existence of PSQQ and QQQP motif.Relevant with immunocompetence containing threonine peptide such as QQPY and/or QPYP. 
 The sequence variation scope of gliadin peptide is large.There is the sequence identical with the part of gliadin peptide sequence and the polypeptide of work (such as one or more objects of the present invention) is gliadin peptide.Total length gliadin comprises gliadin peptide sequence, and one or more peptides of the present invention can partly or wholly be present in described gliadin sequence.Sequence and the sequence of the gliadin being found in natural generation there is difference to a certain degree but the peptide remaining its function (such as remaining the activity of sufficient gliadin peptide toxicity) is the bioactive variants of gliadin peptide.Use term " gliadin " to mean the gliadin of the natural generation of total length herein, use term " polypeptide " and " peptide " to mean its fragment (i.e. the fragment of gliadin) and bioactive variants thereof.Because described polypeptide or peptide can have the sequence identical with the sequence found in gliadin, so described polypeptide or peptide are the fragments from gliadin. 
 Although the sequence of polypeptide of the present invention can be different, useful polypeptide can comprise the fragment of SEQ ID NO:7-10.Described polypeptide can comprise the gliadin of natural expression in plant cell aminoacid sequence or consisting of.Bioactive variants can comprise such as different from the wild-type fragment of gliadin aminoacid sequences, because it contains one or more conservative aminoacid replacement.In some embodiments, in described variant, the amino acid residue of at least 50% is identical with corresponding gliadin wild-type fragment.Bioactive variants also can comprise the aminoacid sequence different from the wild-type fragment of gliadin, due to nonconservative aminoacid replacement, interpolation and/or disappearance. 
 Some aminoacid sequence is called " polypeptide " is intended to represent that it is the linear polymer of amino acid residue, and contributes to itself and full length protein to distinguish.Therefore, the fragment that polypeptide only comprises gliadin (or its bioactive variants) should be understood, but also can comprise other residue.Polypeptide length of the present invention is variable.Such as, described polypeptide can have 8-40 (such as 12,14,16,18 or 20) individual aminoacid or longer (such as reaching about 40 residues). 
 Bioactive variants's polypeptide of gliadin can the similar or identical degree of its sequence and corresponding gliadin fragment characterize.Such as, the sequence of bioactive variants can have at least with corresponding wild type gliadin residue or about 60% homogeneity.Such as, the aminoacid sequence of the bioactive variants of gliadin polypeptide can with gliadin (such as, aminoacid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:7-10) or other polypeptide as herein described (such as, the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:1-6) or its congener (homolog) ortholog thing (ortholog) has at least or about 60% sequence iden (such as at least or the sequence iden of about 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98% or 99%). 
 The bioactive variants of gliadin polypeptide can keep sufficient biologic activity to produce toxicity in the experimenter with the disease that seitan is correlated with.Described biological activity is by well known to a person skilled in the art that method measures, and it includes but not limited to animal model in cellular uptake mensuration, determination of gene expression or body.Bioactive variants can identify, such as, by comparing the relative activity of variant polypeptide and gliadin peptide active fragment.Described mensuration can comprise irrelevant contrast polypeptide (such as can comprise the peptide of the same amino acid content with random distribution in any given test, and only vehicle Control).Some bioactive variants even has stronger biological activity than the fragment of the gliadin of the natural generation of its homology or total length.More specifically, bioactive variants can have native form polypeptide biologic activity at least or about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or higher.

 The hypotype of celiac disease comprises typical celiac disease, atypia celiac disease, celiac disease of hiding and reticent celiac disease.The classical symptom relevant to celiac disease is diarrhoea, abdominal distention and dysplasia.These symptoms are most commonly in the child of 6 to 24 months.The feature of atypia celiac disease is lighter gastrointestinal symptom.Its clinical manifestation outer to intestinal is relevant, such as discovery iron deficiency anemia during diagnosis, osteoporosis, short stature, arthritis, sterile, peripheral neuropathy, high transaminase's mass formed by blood stasis (hypertransaminasemia) and liver failure in some cases.Celiac disease of hiding is used in reference to the patient carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ3, has or serum-free is positive and not yet Villus atrophy occur but may have the patient of mild inflammation or immune activation.Patient's possibility of this hypotype is asymptomatic or may have the outer clinical manifestation of intestinal.The feature of reticent celiac disease is positive serology and Villus atrophy and the asymptomatic patient in other aspects.Implement not containing after seitan diet, some asymptomatic patients significantly improve in the difference life of its body & mind, and such as appetite is improved, fatigue alleviates or dystropy reduces.Do not consider hypotype, many celiac disease cases are not diagnosed, and patient is placed in long-term complications by this, such as sterile with in the risk of malignant tumor such as lymphoma and intestinal cancer. 
 Very big-difference can be there is in the performance of celiac disease.Celiac disease is present in child usually, be a kind of late-blooming disease and along with the classical symptom of malabsorption: to lose weight significantly, steatorrhea and number of drawbacks, stagnate and girl may occur delayed menarche although the outer clinical symptoms of other intestinal such as height growth can be there is. 
 Under precarious position, Prevalence of celiac disease increases, such as celiac disease family history, autoimmune disease, IgA shortage, some hereditary syndrome (mongolism, Turner syndrome and William syndrome) and type 1 diabetes and thyroiditis. 
 Heredodiathesis plays an important role in celiac disease.Celiac disease and concrete human leucocyte antigen (HLA) (HLA) the II genoid being positioned at chromosome 6p21, HLA-DQ2 with HLA-DQ8 is closely related.Most celiac patients (about 95%) expresses the gene of coding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II albuminoid HLA-DQ2.Other patient normally HLA-DQ8 is positive.HLA-DQ2 monoploid is common and the Caucasian of about 30% carries, and this means that the existence of HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 is necessary for disease progression but is not fully, because its risk effect through assessment is only 36% to 53%.Non-HLA gene also contributes to celiac disease susceptibility. 
 The diagnosis of celiac disease depends on many-sided standard usually, comprising: 1) there is typical celiac disease symptom; 2) serological test is positive, comprises the high titre IgA antibody (anti-tTG) of such as tTG, the high titer antibody of deamidization a-gliadin peptide; 3) HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 genotype; 4) small intestinal biopsy activity finds that chyle intestinal is sick; With 5) to not reacting containing seitan diet.The extensive variability of celiac disease presentation causes some doctors to adopt quantitative approach, is defined as " 4/5ths rules ".That is, if at least 4 of meeting in 5 standards can be diagnosed as celiac disease. 
 Dermatitis herpetiformis is the skin symptom of celiac disease, deposits along with herpes and pathognomonic signs skin I gA.Main symptom is strong pruritus and burning sensation.Described rash has the symmetrical of uniqueness.More than in the patient of 90%, elbow and above forearm thereof are affected.Usually other positions affected comprise buttocks, knee, both shoulders, rumpbone, face, scalp, cervical region and trunk.The chyle type Villus atrophy in upper small intestine mucosa has been found in the dermatitis herpetiformis patient of 65% to 75%.Even if having in obvious normal bioptic patient, the trickle Change Example of mucous layer as above Intradermal lymphocyte number increase is also indicating gluten-sensitive.Dermatitis herpetiformis patient may show the series of symptoms identical with having celiac patients, associated conditions and complication (autoimmune disease, iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis and malignant tumor).Dermatitis herpetiformis patient adopts not containing seitan diet usually, because the rash of dermatitis herpetiformis patient is seitan sensitivity. 
 Seitan ataxia is also defined as the positive serum labelling of spontaneous sporadic ataxia and seitan sensitization.Similar with celiac disease, it is autoimmune disease feature is that cerebellar lesion causes ataxia.Seitan related ataxia typically has high titre AGA.The extensive deposition of transglutamin-ase 9 enzyme antibody finds around the cerebrovascular of seitan related ataxia.Seitan ataxia only presents cerebellar ataxia usually, less myoclonus, upper palatal nystagmus or opsoclonus ataxia can occur simultaneously.The usual insidious onset of seitan ataxia, average age of onset is 53 years old.Many patients find that enteropathy becomes in intestinal biopsy.AGA or anti-tTG antibody positive and usually take strict not containing the diet of seitan and regular follow-up without the patient of other ataxia inducements. 
 Seitan is responsive, and but do not tolerate also referred to as non-chyle seitan sensitivity or seitan, common feature is function, morphologic and immunologic disease, does not have all features of celiac disease still gets rid of generation reaction to seitan.Seitan is responsive different from celiac disease, and it is not with anti-tTG autoantibody or other autoimmune complications.The small intestinal of seitan sensitive patients is normally normal.The symptom of seitan sensitivity may be similar to the relevant symptom of celiac disease, but usually have the outer symptom such as behavior change of intestinal, bone or arthralgia, muscle spasm, lower limb numb, lose weight and chronic fatigue.Responsive not special to seitan laboratory biological labelling.Common diagnosis is based on exclusion standard; Get rid of and edible be most commonly used to assessment containing the opening challenge after seitan food and get rid of from patient diet or reduce seitan and can improve health.
