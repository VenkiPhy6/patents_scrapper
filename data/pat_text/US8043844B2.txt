The contents of these three parent applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety. 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a novel micro-organism, new enzymes and new enzymes mixture. In addition, the present invention relates to the composition of the enzymes mixture its preparation and its use in feed, food and other industries including but not limited to the paper industry and the textile industry. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Enzymes have been used for a long time for a variety of different industrial applications. Examples are known in the baking industry, in the wine and fruit juices industry (where enzymes are used to breakdown pectins and β-glucans), in the textile industry (where cellulases are used to obtain soft and smooth cellulosic fabrics) and also, which is not the least application, for animal feed. In this case the enzymes improve the digestibility of vegetable sources. 
 This last use enables the livestock to digest feed more efficiently. The value of a feed can be measured by the FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio), a nutritive ratio of the amount of feed consumed relative to the weight gain of the animal. A decrease in FCR, for a feed indicates the animal gains proportionately more weight for a given quantity of feed; i.e. the animal is able to utilize the feed more efficiently. 
 Poor digestibility of the feed components (starch, fat, protein/amino acids) is a noted feature of cereal-based feeds and, for example, particularly those containing a high barley or wheat content. In these cases it may be necessary to formulate the feed to contain higher levels of energy from other sources and other supplements such as amino acids. These enzymes increase the Apparent Metabolizable Energy value of the cereals incorporated into the Feed. 
 Another approach to resolve this problem has been to add enzyme supplements, cellulases, endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanases (β-glucanases), endo-1,4-β-xylanases (xylanases) etc., or mixtures of enzyme activities, to these cereal-based feeds. Enzyme supplements may have a specific use to hydrolyze the β-glucans, or to hydrolyze the arabinoxylans, found in the cereals (typically barley and wheat). The addition of enzymes has different goals. One advantage which clearly proves the efficacy of feed enzyme supplements is the reduction in viscosity of materials in the gut of the animals which receive cereal-based feed containing the appropriate enzyme supplement. The higher viscosity is due, in part, to β-glucans and arabinoxylans found in barley and wheat. The lower viscosity, resulting from enzyme action, permits an easier absorption of nutritional components in the animal's gut. The other advantage is the release of nutrients entrapped by the cell walls of the cereals decreasing the requirement for other costly feed supplements. Overall the result is a significant reduction in the cost of the feed with a similar or beneficial effect as measured by the FCR. 
 Enzymes preparations originating from a range of different micro-organisms have been described to improve feed digestibility. 
 If we consider prior art related to the use of enzymes in the animal feed we can mention the European Patent No 0.699.762 which describes use of a phytase issued from  Schwanniomyces occidentalis . This phytase is a phytase obtained from genetically modified organism obtained by including cloned gene that we would like to avoid in the present invention. 
 If we consider the WO 95/26398 patent application, again a modified cellulase is obtained by inclusion of foreign DNA sequence in an host cell which modifies the nature of the original strain which is chosen in the following list of micro-organisms:  Bacillus, Streptomyces, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Aspergillus . In the present invention our main aim was to avoid foreign gene inclusion in the micro-organism which is the producer of the enzyme. 
 In the WO 96/05739 patent application, a mixture of enzymes (xylanase, protease and, optionally, β-glucanase) is obtained from different micro-organisms. The authors give example (page 5) of enzymes mixture with a ratio of xylanase activity to β-glucanase activity of the order of 1:5. It has been found that when a xylanase is included in a cereal-based diet at or around its optimum dosage level, the co-presence of enzymes possessing β-glucanase activity increase the FCR of the feed which is of course disadvantageous. Consequently the authors advise against the presence of β-glucanase, they recommend a maximum ratio of xylanase activity to β-glucanase activity of 1:0-0.25. 
 In some cases, in order to ensure all the enzyme activities relevant to the feed application are present, preparations are made up from preparations from more than one micro-organism. In a number of cases the enzyme preparations have been obtained from microorganisms subjected to genetic modification using recombinant DNA techniques. 
 We have discovered and developed a new micro-organism belonging to the class of  Penicillium funiculosum , that contains new enzymes and a mixture of enzyme activities which can be used successfully to increase mainly the digestibility of cereal-based animal feeds. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 Accordingly, the present invention relates to a new micro-organism derived from  Penicillium funiculosum  and a method for cultivating this micro-organism and for recovering the enzymes produced by this micro-organism. 
 In addition, in accordance with this invention, there are provided new enzymes issued from this micro-organism, nucleic acid sequences therefrom and new compositions containing those enzymes. 
 Further, in accordance with this invention, there is provided a method for improving the digestibility of aminoacids and cereal-based animal feeds and amino acids. 
 Another subject of the present invention is the reduction of phosphorus excretion and ammonia excretion from the battery where animals are fed.

 For the fermentation, charge the fermenter with sufficient water, add the ingredients to water in suitable agitated container, stir until the ingredients have dissolved. Sterilise by sealing the fermentor and raising the content to typically 121° C. The fermentation vessel is inoculated with the seed fermenter. 
 The main source of carbon which is added during the process of fermentation is cellulose; amongst different cellulose sources we prefer to use ARBOCEL, SOLKAFLOC, CLAROCEL, ALPHACEL, FIBRACEL with different grades. 
 The pH during the fermentation is preferably controlled by the addition of sulphuric acid, or another acid, and ammonia in gas or liquid form, or another base. 
 At the end of the fermentation time, eliminate solids by solid-liquid separation such as filtration or centrifugation, collect the liquid phase and concentrate for example by ultrafiltration on organic or mineral membrane. 
 These enzymes may also be manufactured from means of recombinant DNA technology and thus be produced by recombinant homologous species or heterologous species. The host for the transfer of the gene coding for the enzyme may be selected from a fungal species, a bacterial cell or a plant cell. Any conventional technique may be used to insert the gene encoding the enzyme of interest in the host cell such as plasmids (integrative or not), phage vectors and viral vectors. The  Penicillium funiculosum  comprising heterologous genes inclusion or modification of the genome with homologous genes by inclusion, deletion or modification of said homologous gene are also part of this invention. 
 In accordance with the invention the enzyme may be provided as an isolated pure enzyme preparation or as a crude preparation such as the cultivation medium in which  Penicillium funiculosum  has been grown. 
 It may be also possible to include this or those enzymes in compositions containing one further enzyme, the type of which depending on the intended use of the composition. The added enzymes may be selected from for example carbohydrases, lipases and proteases.

 1.1. Cellulase by DNS CMC Method 
 The assay for cellulase activity is based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a β-1,4 glucan. The products of the reaction, β-1,4 glucan oligosaccharides, are determined by the resulting increase in reducing value (as glucose). 
 A solution containing 1 ml of a 1% (w/v) CMC solution in 0.1M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 (or at different pH values); 1 ml of appropriately diluted enzyme solution was incubated at 50° C. for 10 minutes. The enzyme reaction is stopped by the addition of 2 ml of a DNS solution (1% (w/v) 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid, 1.6% (w/v) sodium hydroxide, 30% (w/v) potassium sodium (+)-tartrate in distilled water). The solution is mixed and placed into a boiling water bath, 95° C. minimum, for 5 minutes then cooled to 25° C. 10 ml distilled water is added to the solution and the absorbance is measured at 540 nm using a 2 cm path length glass cell. 
 The result is converted to μmoles reducing sugar (as glucose) by comparison with a standard curve for 2 ml of 0.00-0.04% (w/v) glucose solutions treated with DNS solution in an equivalent manner. 
 The observed enzyme reaction absorbance is corrected for non-specific absorbance by carrying out a reaction in which the DNS solution is added to the mixture before the enzyme solution.

 An assay for endo-1,4-β-xylanase activity is based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of a standard wheat arabinoxylan solution, the activity being determined by the reduction in relative viscosity against time. 
 A solution containing 1 ml of a 1% (w/v) wheat arabinoxylan solution in 0.1M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5 (or at different pH values); 3 ml distilled water and 1 ml of appropriately diluted enzyme solution is injected into a Haake microviscometer (using a gold ball calibrated to 0.1-2.0 mPa·s) and the ball drop time (T test ) measured (in ms over the defined drop length) every 30 seconds over a period of 15-20 minutes at 30° C. Mean ball drop times are measured for water (5 ml distilled water) and substrate (1 ml of a 1% (w/v) wheat arabinoxylan solution in 0.1M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5 and 4 ml distilled water) as T water  and T substrate  respectively. Controls are measured in an equivalent manner. The relative fluidity (F r ) is calculated for each value of T test  as follows:

 A solution containing 1 ml of a 0.1% (w/v) p-nitrophenyl β-D-xylopyranoside in distilled water; 1 ml distilled water; 1 ml 0.2M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0; 1 ml of appropriately diluted enzyme solution was incubated at 50° C. for 30 minutes. The enzyme reaction is stopped by the addition of 4 ml of 0.4M glycine solution. The solution is mixed and cooled to 20° C. The absorbance is measured at 400 nm using a 1 cm path length glass cell. 
 The result is converted to μmoles p-nitrophenol by comparison with the molar extenction coefficient of p-nitrophenol under these conditions. 
 The observed enzyme reaction absorbance is corrected for non-specific absorbance by carrying out a reaction in which the glycine solution is added to the mixture before the enzyme solution. One unit of xylosidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme which produces 1 μmole p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl β-D-xylopyranoside per minute under the conditions of the assay (50° C. and pH 5.0).

 1.14 Feruloyl Esterase by the Hydrolysis of Methyl Esters: Methyl Ferulic Acid (MFA); Methyl Caffeic Acid (MCA); Methyl Sinapic Acid (MSA); Methyl P-Coumaric Acid (MPCA) Methods 
 An assay of feruloyl esterase (ferulic acid esterase) is based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of methyl esters of ferulic acid (MFA), caffeic acid (MCA), sinapic acid (MSA) and p-coumaric acid (MpCA). Methyl ester hydrolysis is measured in 0.1M MOPS buffer, pH 6.0 at 37° C. Assays are based on two different techniques. 
 In the spectrophotometric method the methyl ester substrate concentration is 0.10 mM and ester hydrolysis is followed at 325 nm using a 1 cm path length cell. In this method the initial substrate concentration is limited. 
 In the HPLC method, the methyl ester substrate concentration is 1.0 mM and ester hydrolysis is followed at by measuring the release of free acid by HPLC after 10-30 minute intervals. In this method there is no limit over substrate concentration and activities measured are considerably higher than those for the spectrophotometric method. 
 One unit of feruloyl esterase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme which converts 1 μmole substrate to product per minute under the conditions of the assay (37° C. and pH 6.0).

 Enzymes produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  have high levels of cellulase, endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase and other glycanolytic activities. In addition, they are also characterised by high levels of endo-1,4-β-xylanase and xylanase accessory enzyme activities The broad spectrum of hemicellulolytic enzymes is a characteristic of enzyme preparations from this micro-organism. 
 Each activity measured can reported as a ratio to a major activity for that preparation. An example of obtained results is shown in table A. These ratios may change in preparations from different fermentation batches.

 3—Properties of Components in the Enzyme Mixture 
 3.1. Purification Methods 
 Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography 
 The preparation obtained after filtration and concentration of the fermentation medium, to 112.6 mg/ml protein concentration, was diluted 1/1 with Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0/1.7 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 /0.04% sodium azide), exchanged into HIC buffer (PD-10 columns; Pharmacia). Portions (10 ml) were applied to a column (10×5 cm diameter, 200 ml) of PhenylSepharose™ high performance HIC gel (Pharmacia) and separated using a gradient of reducing ammonium sulphate (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ) concentration (1.7-0.0 M) at 10 ml/min. Fractions (10 ml) were collected and assayed for xylanase activity. 
 HIC gave two major peaks of xylanase activity. The first, named A, eluted from the column when the NH 4 ) 2 SO 4  concentration was reduced to about 0.6 M, while the second, named B, eluted at about 0.25 M NH 4 ) 2 SO 4  concentration. Fractions comprising peaks A and B from each injection were pooled separately. In total fraction A corresponded to 2.8% of the total xylanase activity whilst fraction B corresponded to 97.2% of the total xylanase activity. The yield was 77%. 
 Ion-Exchange Chromatography 
 Pooled fractions for peak A and B from HIC were precipitated by increasing the NH 4 ) 2 SO 4  concentration to 100% saturation followed by centrifugation (10 000×g for 30 minutes). Pellets were redissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0/0.04% sodium azide and desalted to the same buffer using PD-10 columns. Samples (5 ml) were applied to a MonoQ™ HR 10/10 anion-exchange column (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0/0.04% sodium azide and eluted at 2 ml/min with increasing concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl (0-1 M) in the same buffer. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and assayed for xylanase activity. 
 Peak A: 
 Separation of peak A by anion-exchange chromatography gave a single peak of xylanase activity which eluted at about 0.3M NaCl. The most active fractions were pooled and analysed by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). This showed a single major band of molecular weight 48 kDa. Recovery of xylanase activity after IEF (isoelectric focusing) confirmed that this major Coomassie-stained band was a xylanase. 
 Peak B: 
 Separation of peak B by anion-exchange chromatography gave two major peaks of xylanase activity, one of which eluted in the void (unbound material; peak B-I) and the other at 0.1 M NaCl (peak B-II). There were also two minor peaks eluting at 0.13 M and 0.19 M NaCl. The active fractions corresponding to each peak were pooled and analysed by SDS-PAGE, but none of the samples were pure. 
 Gel Filtration Chromatography 
 Pooled fractions comprising B-I and B-II were freeze dried, redissolved in water, and desalted (using PD-10 columns). Samples (0.2 ml) were applied to a Superdex™ 75 HR column (Pharmacia) and eluted at 0.4 ml/minute with 20 mM Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0/0.2 M NaCl/0.04% sodium azide. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected and assayed for xylanase activity. 
 3.2. Properties of Xylanases 
 3.2.1 Isoelectric Point by Isoelectric Focusing 
 Isoelectric points of proteins are determined by standard methods using pre-cast vertical 5% polyacrylamide gels from NOVEX® for pH 3-10 and pH 3-7. NOVEX® cathode, anode and IEF sample buffers, and standard protocol for isoelectric focusing, fixing, staining with Coomassie R-250 Blue Stain, and destaining are used. 
 For xylanase A, a sample following MonoQ was used. For xylanases B-I and B-II, a sample following HIC, xylanase B, was used. For each of A and B, a small sample (10 μl) was loaded into a single well and a large sample (50 μl) was loaded into a triple well. After focussing the samples, the gel was cut in half such that one half contained the two small samples (A+B) and the molecular weight markers (this half was stained with Coomassie), while the other half contained the two large samples. The gel half containing the large samples was cut to separate the two samples lanes, and subsequently each lane was fractionated into 2 mm pieces. Each 2 mm piece was soaked separately overnight in 100 mM MOPS buffer, pH 6.0/0.04% sodium azide. Fractions were assayed for xylanase activity. 
 For xylanase sample A, the stained IEF gel showed a single major band of pl 3.55 marker and a few minor contaminating bands. Xylanase activity was found only in the fraction corresponding to this band, confirming the xylanase major band. 
 For xylanase sample B, the stained IEF gel indicates several bands over a range of pl values. Xylanase activity occurred in two separated fractions of the unstained gel, and corresponding to proteins of pi 4.2 and 4.8. 
 3.2.2 Molecular Weight by SDS-PAGE 
 To confirm the molecular weights of xylanases in peak B from HIC, the fractions with xylanase activity eluted from the JEF gel were deslated, freeze-dried, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Denaturing PAGE was performed using 10% Tris-glycine gels (NOVEX®) with dithiothreitol (DTT 50 mM) included in the sample buffer as a reducing agent. 
 The stained gel indicated that both xylanases were pure, with molecular weights of 36 kDa and 15 kDa for xylanase B-I and xylanase B-II respectively. 
 All three purified xylanases were subjected to SDS-PGE analysis: xylanase A fraction after anion-exchange chromatography, xylanase B-I and B-II fractions after gel filtration chromatography. Xylanase A gave a single band of molecular weight 48 kDa. Xylanase B-I gave one major and four minor bands after Coomassie staining. The major band was confirmed as the xylanase since it was of molecular weight 36 kDa. The purity is estimated at 90%. Xylanase B-II gave a major band of molecular weight 15 kDa and 2-3 minor bands. This xylanase is approximately 95% pure.

3.2.4 Sequences
 
 One embodiment of the present invention is related to the amino acid and the nucleic acid sequences of the above described proteins or their variants. 
 For this purpose, the sequences for xylanases were identified from amino acid sequences of purified proteins (xylanase A, xylanase B-I and xylanase B-II) and from comparisons of amino acid and nucleotide sequences of known fungal xylanases. 
 It is understood for the invention that variants refers to any polypeptide or any protein analog, protein fragment, derived or mutated protein from the native protein or polypeptide and having the same biological functions as the said native protein or polypeptide. Different variants may be exist at natural state. Those variants may be for example allelic variations characterized by differences into the sequence of genes encoding for the said protein or may result from differential splicing or from post-traditional modifications. Variants are obtainable by substitution, deletion, addition and/or modification of one or more amino acids. The all modifications are well known and can be performed by any method known of one skilled in the art. 
 Variants are molecules having for example more affinity for their substrate or having new biological properties. 
 Another object of the present invention is also the use of the sequences for the expression of the disclosed proteins or polypeptides in host cells of uni- or pluricellular organisms. For this purpose, the said sequences may be comprised into the genome of a vector. The said vector may be a plasmid, a phage or a virus. In hence, another embodiment of the invention is a host isolated cell from uni- or pluricellular organism, transfected or infected by a vector as above described. In a preferred embodiment the host cell is a bacteria. 
 The use of said vectors comprising the nucleic acid sequence of the disclosed proteins for the expression of said protein in any host cell is another embodiment of the present invention. 
 3.2.4.1 Sequences of Xylanase C 
 The production of probes was based on comparisons of amino acid and nucleotide sequences of known fungal xylanases. Conserved regions were identified and used to design PCR primers, whose products would be used to screen a genomic library of  Penicillium funiculosum.    
 Two pairs of degenerate primers were made. The first pair were designed to amplify a 200 pb (approximate) product from a xylanase type B (or type 2) gene. The second pair were designed to amplify a 250 bp product from a xylanase type A (or type 1) gene. 
 A 258 bp band was produced with primers 3 and 4. After cloning into pGEMT and sequencing this was found to have significant sequence similarity to fungal xylanase type A/1. The plasmid containing the cloned product has been named pPFXYLA. 
 The complete sequence of xylanase C is shown in  FIG. 1  and in SEQ NO: 1. 
 3.2.4.2 Sequences of Xylanase BI 
 The internal amino acid sequence, together with sequence alignments of other fungal cellobiohydrolases were used to design degenerate PCR primers (SEQ ID NO:3 and NO:4). A 290 bp product (SEQ ID NO:5) was amplified and cloned into pGEMT (Promega) to create pGEMTCB2 and sequenced. As shown in  FIG. 2 , the primer sequences are underlined. This PCR product is currently being used as a probe to screen a  Penicillium funiculosum  IMI134756 genomic library. 
 3.2.4.3 Sequences of Xylanase BII 
 The all sequence of the xylanase BII gene includes 1.3 kb of 5+ untranslated and upstream region and 0.85 kb of 3′ untranslated, a 54 bp intron and 669 bp encoding a 223 amino acid protein. 
 Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to prove the existence of the 54 bp intron. Total RNA was isolated from mycelia of  Penicillium funiculosum  IMI-134756 cultures, harvested after 4 days growth on 1% (w/v) oat spelt xylan. Primers were designed to amplify up to 195 bp fragment from messenger RNA (249 bp from genomic DNA) and to 433 bp (487 bp with genomic DNA). 
 Sequencing of 3 kb at the 3′ end of the plasmid (pPFXYNC2, revealed a gene (designated per A) that contains two putative introns and encodes a polypeptide of approximately 570 amino acids. The polypeptide showed significant sequence similarity to fungal amino acid permeases. 
 3.2.4.4 Sequence of Xylanase A 
 The internal sequence of Xylanase A was obtained and is represented by the following amino acid sequence: 
 AEAINYNQDY (SEQ ID NO:10) 
 3.3 Properties of Feruloyl Esterases 
 3.3.1 Purification 
 It is carried out following the same process as for xylanases. 
 The enzymes mixture contains at least two distinct feruloyl esterases. One of these (FaeB) has a molecular weight of 38,945-41,051 Da by mass spectrometry (35,450 Da from the primary amino acid sequence and 37 kDa by SDS-PAGE). FaeB has a pl of 4.2, it is a type B feruloyl esterase and is specific for MpCA and Ara 2 F substrates (activity against MpCA, MCA, MFA and Ara 2 F; but not against MSA and FAXX). 
 The other feruloyl esterase (FaeA) has a molecular weight of 29 kDa (by SDS-PAGE). FaeA has a pl of 4.65, it is a type A feruloyl esterase and is specific for FAXX and MSA substrates (activity against MSA, MCA, MFA and FAXX but not MpCA Ara 2 F). 
 3.3.2. Isoelectric Point by Isoelectric Focusing 
 Isoelectric points of proteins are determined by the standard methods. The enzymes mixture was applied as a wide strip (about 20 mm) to an IEF gel and electrophoresed at reduced temperature (5° C.). After focusing and band sharpening, the gel was cut down the middle of the sample lane. One half of the sample lane and the IEF standards were fixed, stained and destained using the standard protocol. The other half lane was cut into 2 mm wide sections and each section soaked overnight in 1 ml of 100 mM MOPS buffer, pH 6.0. Feruloyl esterase activity was determined for each section of the gel using MFA, MpCA and MSA as substrates. 
 The stained IEF gel indicates the presence of very many proteins in cellulase with pl's ranging from very acidic (pl 2.4) to about pl 7. Most of the proteins are acidic (pl range 2.4-5). Two peaks of feruloyl esterase activity were detected in fractions cut from the gel. One, corresponding to FaeB, had a pl of 4.2 and activity only against MFA and MpCA (not MSA). The other, corresponding to FaeA, had a pl of 4.65 and activity against all three substrates tested. 
 3.3.3 Molecular Weight by SDS-PAGE 
 Molecular weights were analysed by SDS-PAGE using 10% Tris-Glycine gels. SDS-PAGE gels were run, fixed, stained with Coomassie Blue Stain and destained using the standard protocol. 
 The enzymes mixture contains at least two distinct feruloyl esterases. One corresponding to FaeB (pl 4.2) has a molecular weight of 37 kDa. The other, corresponding to FaeA (pi 4.65) has a molecular weight of 29 kDa. 
 The molecular weight of FaeB is estimated at 34,450 Da from the primary amino acid sequence, and at 38,945-41,051 Da by mass spectrometry.

 The enzymes mixture contains activity against all the substrates tested. With the methyl esters, activity is highest against MpCA and lowest against MSA. The activities against Ara 2 F and FAXX are higher than against the methyl esters which is indicative that the esterase activities are due to true feruloyl esterases and not general esterases or side activities of other cell wall-degrading esterases (e.g. acetyl xylan esterase, pectin esterase).

 Several degenate PCR primers were designed from amino acid sequences obtained from the purified protein. Many products were cloned into pGEMT (Promega) and sequenced. 
 A plasmid named pGEMTD19 (180 bp) ( FIG. 3 ) was found by PCR to contain sequence that was recognisable as peptide sequence 4 shown above. As shown in  FIG. 3 , the primer sequences have been double underlined previously known sequence, singly underlined. 
 The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of FAE-A are disclosed in SEQ ID NO:7. 
 3.3.5.2 Sequence of FEA-B 
 Primers designed from peptide sequence of FAE-B were used to amplify up a probe, that was subsequently used to screen a  Penicillium funiculosum  genomic library. A 2291 bp clone was isolated and has been sequenced. The gene encoding for a 304 amino acid polypeptide and has one putative intron. The predicted amino acid sequence is shown in  FIG. 4  (SEQ ID NO:9) wherein the mature protein (mature protein length=338) is in Bold. This protein comprises two distinct domains separated by a highly glycosylated linker. As shown in  FIG. 4 , the catalytic domain is in Bold, whereas the binding domain is in Bold double underlined and the linker is represented in dotted Bold line. 
 The protein is also featured by a putative active site motif (serine=nucleophile) as shown underlined in  FIG. 4  with the following Putative catalytic triads:
         (1) S136/D174/H216   (2) S136/D220/H276.       
 The FAE-B protein comprises also a secretion sequence (353) and 10 cysteines. 
 3.4 Properties of Glucanases 
 The enzymes mixture was subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis. IEF was carried out using pre-cast vertical 5% polyacrylamide gels from NOVEX® for pH 3-7 (pl performance range 3.0-6.5) in the NOVEX® XCell II™ Mini-Cell. NOVEX® cathode, anode and IEF sample buffers for pH 3-7 and the NOVEX® standard protocol for isoelectric focusing are used. One lane was cut off and electrophoresed in the second dimension using a 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel. A second lane was separated from the gel, cut into 35 fractions, the gel strips soaked in buffer, and fractions assayed for enzyme activity. The third lane was left on the gel, fixed, stained with Coomassie R-250 Blue Stain and destained using the NOVEX® standard protocol. 
 Significant endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase (DNS barley β-glucan method) and cellulase (DNS CMC method) activities were found in fractions corresponding to proteins with pl 4.2, M.W. 36 kDa and pl 5.4, M.W. 27 kDa. To eliminate Xylanase B-I as being in one of the fractions, the fractions were tested for activity using the DNS birchwood xylan method. No xylanase activity was detected in the fractions corresponding to β-glucanase or cellulase activities.

 E. Uses of Enzymes Mixture to Feed Animals 
 Example 1 
 Evaluation of Enzymes Preparation Produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  Efficacy on Energy Value (AMEN) of Mixed Wheat-Barley Diet in Broilers 
 The aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of enzymes (activity of β-glucanase: 100 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1100 U·kg −1 ) on Apparent Metabolizable Energy corrected for nitrogen balance (AME N ) of a diet containing 50% wheat and 22% barley. 
 Experiences are led on Control and Enzymes Preparation (activity of β-glucanase: 100 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1100 U·kg −1 ) using the European Reference Method (Bourdillon et al., 1990) with ad libitum feeding and total excreta collection between 18 and 21 days of age. 
 a. Material and Methods 
 Birds: Breed and Breeding Conditions 
 Day old male Ross broilers are reared in collective battery cages till 12 days of age. They are fed a standard starter diet. At day 12, birds are weighed and equally distributed into 10 individual cages per treatment and were then fed the experimental diets for the adaptation period (minimum 5 days). 
 Standard temperature and humidity programs are applied. The lighting program is kept constant 23 hours light and 1 hour darkness up to the end of the trial. 
 Feeds: Birds received a starter diet from day old to 12 days of age and then the experimental feeds. 
 Experimental Diets 
 Feeds contained 50% wheat and 22% barley (Table 1.1). Enzymes Preparation was sprayed onto 20 kg of crumbles. 
 In-feed enzyme recoveries are measured by viscometric method (Sabatier and Fish, 1996). 
 Measurement of Metabolizable Energy 
 The balance starts D18 according to the following procedure
         D 17, birds were fasted overnight;   D 18, birds weighing, clean collection trays;   D 19, faeces were collected and frozen   D 20, faeces were collected and frozen, overnight fast;   D 21, faeces were collected and frozen, birds weighed and refed.       
 Faeces are then freeze-dried and ground as feed (1 mm, Retsch grinder). Gross energy of feed and excreta are measured on an IKA C5000 adiabatic calorimeter. Protein (N*6.25, Kjeldahl method Z130) and lipid (method Z160) contents are also determined. Correction for nitrogen balance was applied using 18% protein in the weight gain. 
 b. Results and Discussion 
 Apparent Metabolisable Energy Corrected for Nitrogen Balance (AMEN) 
 Zootechnical performances and Metabolisable Energy are presented Table 1.2. There was no difference in zootechnical performances between treatments. 
 In growing broilers, Enzymes Preparation improves AMEN of a 50% wheat and 22% barley-based diet by 6.2% (+204 kcal/kg DM (Dry Matter)). 
 Moreover, variability in energy digestibility was decreased from 80 to 62 kcal·kg DM. This high improvement demonstrates the interest of both activities (xylanase and β-glucanase) produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  to hydrolysed soluble non starch polysaccharide of wheat and barley.

a. Material and Methods
 
Birds: Breed and Breeding Conditions
       
 Day-old Ross male chicks are reared in collective battery cages up to 12 days of age. They are then transferred to individual battery cages for digestive balance. 
 Standard temperature and humidity programs are applied. The lighting program was 23 hours light and 1 h darkness up to 8 days of age. It was then modified to 15 h 30 light, 8 h 30 darkness due to a layer trial run in the same building. 
 Feeds: Birds received a standard starter diet up to 12 days of age and then the experimental feeds. 
 Experimental Diets 
 Experimental diets contained 54% wheat. Characteristics are given Table 2.1. Diet composition is reported Table 2.2. 
 Measurement of Apparent Metabolisable Energy 
 The balance starts on Day 17 according to the following schedule:
         D 17, birds were fasted overnight;   D 18, birds weighing, clean collection trays;   D 19, feces were collected and freezed;   D 20, feces were collected and freezed, overnight fast;   D 21, feces were collected and freezed, birds weighed and refed.       
 Feces are then freeze-dried and ground as feed (1 mm, Retsch grinder). Gross energy of feed and excreta are measured on an IKA C5000 adiabatic calorimeter. Protein (N*6.25, Kjeldahl method Z130 for feeds and Z135 for feces) and lipid (method Z160) contents are also determined. 
 An amino acid profile is also performed by HPLC (method Z100 for feeds and Z080 for feces). Phosphorus content of feeds and exoreta was measured using the AFNOR method (NFV18-106). 
 b. Results and Discussion 
 Apparent Metabolisable Energy (AME) 
 Growth performance and metabolisable energy data are presented Table 2.3. Performance (weight gain, feed intake), measured over the three day period, did not differ between treatments. AME of the control diet containing 54% ground wheat was 3173 kcal/kg. Metabolisable energy of the diet containing the same total amount of wheat but of which 30% is as whole grain, is increased by 100 kcal/kg compared with the theoretical value. Moreover, variability appreciated by the standard deviation of the different criterions measured is also reduced with whole wheat. 
 Enzymes produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  (activity of β-glucanase: 100 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1100 U·kg −1 ) enhances metabolisable energy value of a 54% wheat-based diet by +3.4% (122 kcal/kg DM) if all wheat is ground and by +2.7% (101 kcal/kg DM) if 30% of the wheat is included as whole grains. 
 Apparent Digestibility of Nutrients (Lipids, Proteins and Amino Acids) 
 When all wheat is ground, apparent lipid and protein digestibilities are increased by 7 and 2.7% respectively, with Enzymes Preparation of  Penicillium funiculosum . With part of the wheat as whole grains, the increase is less: +3 and +0.6% respectively, due to an overall enhanced nutrient digestibility. Indeed, nutrient digestibility with control diet containing whole wheat was similar to that of the experimental diet containing only ground wheat but supplemented with Enzymes Preparation. 
 Enzymes Preparation effects on apparent amino acid digestibility is presented Table 2.4. The improvement with Enzymes Preparation reaches on average +2.9% with all wheat as ground wheat and +1.1% with whole grains, confirming the effect on apparent protein digestibility. 
 Apparent Phosphorus Retention and Phosphorus Excretion 
 Enzymes preparation effect on apparent phosphorus retention is presented Table 2.5. Apparent phosphorus retention is significantly increased with Enzymes Preparation addition: +8.0%. This increase is greater than those observed for the other nutrients (+2.9 to +3.5% depending on the criterion: AME, proteins, lipids, amino acids). Such an increase might thus result from improved nutrient digestibility (direct effect of xylanase and β-glucanase) but also from a better action of the wheat phytase. When hydrolyzing non starch polysaccharides's, xylanase and β-glucanase give more accessibility to phytic acid for the endogenous wheat phytase. 
 This better digestive utilisation of phosphorus thus reduces phosphorus excretion: −8% when expressed as g phosphorus per kg weight gain.

 Evaluation of Enzymes Preparation on AMEN of a Wheat Based Diet in Growing Turkeys 
 The aim of this assay is to demonstrate the efficacy of Enzymes Preparation from  Penicillium funiculosum  (activity of β-glucanase: 100 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1100 U·kg −1 ) on Apparent Metabolizable Energy (AME) of a wheat-based diet according to the following experimental design
         (1) Control;   (2) EP 1: Enzymes Preparation (activity of β-glucanase 100 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1100 U·kg −1 );   (3) EP 2: Enzymes Preparation (activity of β-glucanase 150 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1650 U·kg −1 );
 
using the European Reference Method (Bourdillon et al., 1990) with ad libitum feeding and total excreta collection between 33 and 37 days of age.
 
a. Material and Methods
 
Birds: Breed and Breeding Conditions
       
 Day, old male BUT9 turkeys were reared in collective battery cages up to 20 days of age. They were then transferred to individual battery cages for the digestibility balance after an adaptation period of at least 7 days. 
 Standard temperature and humidity programmes were applied. The lighting program was kept constant 23 hours light and 1 hour darkness for the 2 first weeks and then reduced to 15 hours light for 9 hours darkness up to the end of the trial. 
 Feeds: Birds received a standard complete starter diet from day-old to 21 days of age and then the experimental feeds. 
 Experimental Diets 
 Feeds contained 47% wheat and 33% soybean meal (Table 3.1). Enzyme spraying was done in on 20 kg pellets of control diets. 
 Measurement of Metabolizable Energy 
 At D 21, birds were weighed and equally distributed in 10 individual cages per treatment and were then fed the experimental diets. 
 The balance starts D 33 according to the following procedure:
         D 32, birds were fasted overnight;   D 33, birds weighing, clean collection trays;   D 34 and D 35, feces were collected and freezed;   D 36, feces were collected and freezed, overnight fast;   D 37, feces were collected and freezed, birds weighed and refed.       
 Feces are then freeze-dried and ground as feed (1 mm, Retsch grinder). Gross energy of feed and excreta are measured on an IKA C5000 adiabatic calorimeter. 
 The AME is corrected for N balance by taking into account the body weight gain (g) and its nitrogen content (21% crude protein). 
 Feces are then freeze-dried and ground as feed (1 mm, Retsch grinder). Gross energy of feed and excreta are measured on an IKA C5000 adiabatic calorimeter. Protein (N*6.25, Kjeldahl method Z130 for feeds and Z135 for feces) is also determined and an amino acid profile performed by HPLC (method Z100 for feeds and Z080 for feces). 
 b. Results and Discussion 
 Apparent Metabolisable Energy (AME) 
 Zootechnical performances and Metabolisable Energy are presented Table 3.2. There was no significant difference in growing performance during the balance between treatments. 
 In growing turkeys, Enzymes Preparation improves AME N  of a wheat-based diet by 2.2 and 5.4% for EP 1 and EP 2 respectively. 
 The high improvement observed demonstrates the interest of both activities (xylanase and β-glucanase) contained in Enzyme Preparation to hydrolysed non starch polysaccharide of wheat for improving energy value of this cereal in growing turkeys.

 Example 4 
 Evaluation of Enzymes Preparation Produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  Efficacy of Wheat-Based Complete Feed Diet in Growing Pigs 
 The objective is to evaluate the effect of enzyme supplementation of wheat-based diets on energy digestion in the small intestine of growing pigs. Enzymes Preparation normal level activity is 1100 U·kg −1  for xylanase and 100 U·kg −1  for β-glucanase. 
 a. Material and Methods 
 Animals 
 The treatments were tested according to a Latin square design with three diets and three periods and two pigs per diet* period. The diets were fed at fixed levels according to weight of pig throughout the period of the test. 
 Experimental Diet 
 A diet based on poor quality wheat and balanced with other typical feed ingredients was fed to six growing pigs (see table 4.1.). The diet was fed either:
         1. Unsupplemented (basal);   2. Supplemented (1): with Enzymes Preparation at 1× level (activity of β-glucanase 100 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 1100 U·kg −1 );   3. Supplemented (2): with Enzymes Preparation at 2× level (activity of β-glucanase 200 U·kg −1  and activity of xylanase: 2200 U·kg −1 );       
 Accurate dosing of the diet was achieved by diluting the Enzymes Preparation with corn starch to create a premix which was then added to the diet as appropriate. 
 Sample Collection 
 Ileal juices were collected for a period of 48 hours each week according to standard procedures at the RPNA laboratories. A sample of the ileal juice and of the test diets were analysed for energy by bomb calorimetry by Sanders to determine digestible energy. Aliquots of the samples were stored for further analysis if necessary. 
 Statistical Analysis 
 Digestibility of the crude energy was calculated from the results of the bomb calorimetry of the ileal juices, feed and feed intakes. Analysis of variance was undertaken on the digestibility calculations.

b. Results and Discussion
 
 The xylanase supplementation of diets of pigs increased the energy digestibility by at least six percent. This indicates that the enzyme is increasing the breakdown of the raw material cell walls (in particular, wheat) and the release of additional energy in the small intestine.

 Example 5 
 Effect of Enzymes Preparation Produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  on Performance of Straw, Corn Silage, Hay and Grass Silage Diets in Ruminants 
 HFT test (Hohenheimer Futterwertesten, Menke et al., 1979, 1988) is an in vitro incubation test allowing the measure of raw material degradation through the gas volume produced by the fermentation of these fedstuffs in a buffered rumen juice. 
 a. Material and Methods 
 200 mg of dried and ground substrate is incubated with 10 ml of rumen juice plus 20 ml of buffer in syringes which are gently agitated on a rotor in a temperature controlled incubator (39° C.). Volume of gas produced are registered at 24 hours. Blank (without substrate), standard hay control and standard concentrate control (with known value of net gas volume production) are used to correct the results and calculate a net volume of gas produced in 24 hours. The energy value and OMD (Organic Matter Digestibility) of substrates are calculated using volume of gas produced in 24 hours and predictor equations proposed by Menke et al. (1988). 
 Rumen juice is collected on 2 dry cows, rumen cannulated and fed at 8 a.m. and 7 pm with a ration composed with 6 kg hay and 2 kg concentrate (ratio 75/25). Rumen juice collect is realized just before a.m. feeding. Rumen juice is filtered to avoid alimentary particules passage and is maintained in strict anaerobic conditions. 
 The aim of this trial was to test the effect of Enzymes Preparation application on the forage 15 hours before HFT incubation. 
 Pretreatment with Enzymes Preparation: the enzyme solution is spraid on the forage on the floor on straw, corn silage, hay and grass silage. Spraying is realized with 1 ml of Enzymes Preparation onto 2 kg forage dry matter. Forage at the edge (about 10 cm) is rejected to improve the homogeneity of the sample. After treatment, the forage is mixed by hand and left at room temperature for 15 hours after spraying. HFT incubation is carried out after 15 hours Enzymes Preparation contact through one serie and 6 replicates per treatment. 
 b. Results and Discussion 
 Net gas volume production at 24 hours is given in the table 5.1 for straw, corn silage, hay and grass silage. 
 Application of cellulase on straw through pretreatment gives a 18% net volume of gas improvement vs. control. For corn silage, this improvement is 8%, for hay, 9.5% and for grass silage 9%. 
 OMD is given in the table 5.2. for the different forage before and after pretreatment. 
 OM digestibility is respectively improved for straw, corn silage, hay and grass silage vs. control: 8.5% straw, 5% corn silage, 5.4% hay and 5% grass silage. 
 15 hours pretreatment of forages (straw, corn silage, hay, grass silage) with Enzyme Preparation improves intensity of rumen substrate incubation and OM digestibility of substrate.

 Example 6 
 Effect of Enzymes Preparation Produced by  Penicillium funiculosum  on Performance of Wheat or Barley-Fed Layers 
 The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of Enzymes Preparation addition on productive parameters of laying hens fed with wheat or barley-based diets. 
 a. Material and Methods 
 Experiment Design: 4 treatments×8 replicates×5 cages×3 hens 
 Treatments: 1. Control 1: 60% wheat
         2. Control 1+Enzymes Preparation   3. Control 2: 60% barley   4. Control 2+Enzymes Preparation
 
Animals, Housing and Management
       
 The trial was conducted on four hundred and eighty brown hens of the Hy-Line strain. Each replicate was formed by five pens, with a common feeder, i.e. a total of thirty-two replicates of fifteen birds each. 
 Distributed in two identical rooms, the replicates had programmable lights and ventilation. The lighting program started with 14 hours of light per day on arrival of hens at 17 weeks of age, increasing every two weeks by 30 minutes up to a maximum of 17 hours of light per day. 
 Hens were 22 weeks old at the beginning of the experiment, that lasted during the first five months of laying period. 
 Diets and Feeding 
 There were two experimental diets based on 60% of wheat (diet 1) and 60% of barley (diet 2), and 10% of sunflower meal. Their composition is shown in Table 6.1. 
 Cereals characteristics are presented Table 6.2. 
 Controls 
 Chemical Analysis: 
 Feed Samples 
 Quality control of experimental feeds was performed by analyzing dry matter, crude protein, crude fat and ash. 
 Xylanase activity (T-1, T-2) and β-glucanase activity (T-3, T-4) were determined in mash feeds. 
 Measurements 
 Feed consumption and feed efficiency were recorded every four weeks. Hens were weighed at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. Egg production, egg weight and percentage of dirty and faulty eggs were recorded daily, during five periods of four weeks each. Mortality was checked and recorded daily, including the cause of death. 
 b. Results and Discussion 
 Performance Trial 
 The productive parameters obtained during the trial are shown in Tables 6.3 to 6.5. In the first two periods (from week 22 to 30) and in the overall experiment the percentage of dirty eggs was statistically affected by treatment (P>0.005). Animals fed wheat diet without enzyme produced more dirty eggs. Statistically significant differences between treatments were found in egg laying percentage (P>0.05) and in egg weight (P>0.005) from second period to the end of experiment. Animals fed barley diets presented higher egg laying percentage and produced heavier eggs than animals fed wheat diets. Enzymes Preparation seem to increase these parameters but not significantly at 0.05 level of probability. 
 In all experimental periods, feed intake of animals from treatments T-3 and T-4 (barley diets) was higher than consumption of animals fed wheat diets, due to the energy levels of both diets (barley diets were formulated at 2600 kcal/kg of energy while wheat diets contained 2800 kcal/kg). Taking into account the different energy values of both types of diets and feed consumption of animals, in the overall period all animals presented the same daily energy consumption. 
 The feed efficiency (expressed as g feed/g egg) of experimental diets during the first period was very high due to the low egg laying rate of hens during this period of time. In the first two periods, feed efficiency for wheat treatments was better than those obtained with barley treatments; but in third period, when highest egg laying percentages were recorded, both types of diets presented similar efficiencies. From week 34 to the end of experiment, barley diets presented better feed efficiencies than treatments with wheat. Enzyme tends to improve feed efficiency (P>0.05). In the overall period β-glucanase improved feed efficiency of barley diet (with a P=0.066). 
 Table 6.4 shows that wheat-fed layers supplemented with Enzymes Preparation tend to exhibit higher laying rates (+1.5 absolute points), greater mean egg weight (+0.37 g) and lower Feed Conversion Ratio (−2.7%) than unsupplemented ones. 
 Table 6.5 shows that Enzyme Preparation addition to barley-fed layers improved laying rate (+4%), mean egg weight (+0.7%) and Feed Conversion Ratio (−5.7%) compared with control barley diets.
