 The present invention relates to a kind of microorganism with the ornithine throughput of improvement, and use the method for this microorganisms producing ornithine. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Ornithine is a kind of material extensively occurred in plant, animal and microorganism, and it can be used as the biosynthetic precursor of arginine, proline(Pro) and polyamine.As a kind of non-essential amino acid, ornithine does not find in protein, but it is present in the peptide antibiotics of such as tyrocidine (tyrosidine) and linear gramicidins.In the internal metabolism of higher animal, ornithine has played vital role in the excretion pathway of the urea generated from amino acid or ammonia by urea cycle. 
 Ornithine contributes to forming muscle and reducing body fat, and therefore it can be used as nutritional supplement.Immunostimulant is can be used as the ornithine of 2:1 and the ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) of α-ketoglutaric acid containing proportional.Ornithine also can be used as the medicine improving liver cirrhosis and liver dysfunction, because it contributes to removing harmful ammonia in liver.The currently known methods producing ornithine is by digestive ferment process milk casein and uses the intestinal bacteria transformed or the industrial microorganism belonging to corynebacterium, and they are widely used in the production of amino acid, nucleic acid, enzyme and microbiotic sample material. 
 In the microorganism belonging to corynebacterium, L-arginine is synthesized from L-glutamic acid by the enzyme of the genetic expression on the arginine operon of argCJBDFRGH form.Arginine operon gene has played of paramount importance effect in arginic biosynthesizing, uses intracellular L-glutamic acid (Pidolidone) to synthesize arginine as substrate, and generate ornithine as intermediate between arginine synthesis phase.Particularly, illustrate in fig. 2 in a kind of microorganism belonging to corynebacterium from L-glutamic acid extremely arginic route of synthesis, known argJ encodes a kind of enzyme glutamic acid rotating being turned to N-acetylglutamat in arginine route of synthesis, argB encodes a kind of enzyme N-acetylglutamat being converted into N-acetylglutamat phosphoric acid in arginine route of synthesis, it is the enzyme of N-acetylglutamat semialdehyde by N-acetylglutamat phposphate that argC encodes a kind of in arginine route of synthesis, argD encodes a kind of enzyme N-acetylglutamat semialdehyde being converted into N-acetylornithice in arginine route of synthesis, argJ encodes a kind of enzyme N-acetylornithice being converted into ornithine in arginine route of synthesis, argF encodes a kind of enzyme ornithine being converted into citrulline in arginine route of synthesis, argG encodes a kind of enzyme citrulline being converted into argininosuccinate acid in arginine route of synthesis, and argH encodes and a kind of argininosuccinate acid is converted into arginic enzyme in arginine route of synthesis, and ornithine route of synthesis is included in arginine route of synthesis. 
 It is develop with the expression level increasing the enzyme related in Arginine biosynthesis by a sudden change being induced among arginine operon or by promoter mutation that known arginine produces bacterial strain.Wherein, control and suppress argR that arginine operon expresses and the argB that suppressed by arginine-level to have received study (Korean Patent Publication No. 2010-0060909) widely as increasing target spot that arginine produces. 
 In order to the improvement of ornithine throughput, known by the substratum being supplemented with proline(Pro), cultivate Corynebacteria microorganism or by improvement impeller mixer and the culture condition improved during this microorganism culturing thus the effect of ornithine dehydrocyclization enzyme (ocd) increase thus produce ornithine.In addition, when using the intestinal bacteria transformed, by cultivating argF and argR-deletion mycopremna in the substratum being supplemented with L-glutamic acid, or throughput by using the conversion bacterial strain of disappearance proB gene to improve ornithine, the gamma-glutamyl kinases wherein related in the proline synthesis approach that starts from L-glutamic acid of proB genes encoding instead of the first step of ornithine route of synthesis that starts from L-glutamic acid. 
 In addition, people are studying corynebacterium glutamicum to obtain the production as the high yield of the L-glutamic acid of ornithine precursor always.Known restriction vitamin H or with penicillin G or a kind of fatty acid surfactants process can strengthen corynebacterium glutamicum L-glutamic acid secretion.Because these process are relevant to the damage of cell walls, therefore, namely think that L-glutamic acid can the passive cell walls through damage. 
 The NCg11221 protein deriving from wild type glutamic acid coryneform bacteria (Cgl13032) contributes to the outflow of trimethyl-glycine, its aminoacid sequence and the aminoacid sequence similar (Korean Patent Publication No. 2010-0017581) of intestinal bacteria mechanical sensitivity channel protein yggB.
