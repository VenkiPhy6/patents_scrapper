(3) reduced activity or disappearance. 
 As having PQQ-ADH (1) and PQQ-ALDH (2) activity, and the D-Glucose diacid of a variety of ALDH (3) reduced activity
The concrete example of the raised microorganism of production capacity can enumerate raw saccharon littlefruit grape herb saccharic acid bacillus (Pseudogluconobacter
Saccharoketogenes) Rh47-3 plants (FERM BP-10820). 
 Rh47-3 plants are bacterial strains (WO/2008/139844) for the manufacture of D-Glucose aldehydic acid, and are had L- sorb
Glycosyloxy turns to the life saccharon littlefruit grape herb saccharic acid bacillus (Pseudogluconobacter of the ability of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid
The variant of saccharoketogenes) K591s plants (tekiaki 62-228288, FERM BP-1130).

Strain has PQQ-ADH (1) relevant to the generation of D-Glucose diacid and PQQ-ALDH (2) activity, furthermore, generate Mek-Tol Unit
ALDH (3) activity is low, so D-Glucose diacid can be efficiently generated from D-Glucose, maltonic acid, D-Glucose aldehydic acid. 
 On the other hand, though K591s plants have PQQ-ADH (1) active, PQQ-ALDH (2) activity is almost not confirmed, then
Person, since ALDH (3) active (in particular, PQQ/Heme-ALDH (4)) is strong in the extreme, to once act on D-Glucose, D-
Gluconic acid, D-Glucose aldehydic acid, then mainly generate Mek-Tol Unit, as a result, can not efficiently generate D-Glucose diacid. 
 As the bacterial strain for having same property with K591s plants, for example, there is raw saccharon littlefruit grape herb saccharic acid bacillus

12-15 plants of littlefruit grape herb saccharic acid bacillus (Pseudogluconobacter saccharoketogenes) (FERM BP-1132), life
Saccharon littlefruit grape herb saccharic acid bacillus (Pseudogluconobacter saccharoketogenes) 22-3 plants of (FERM BP-
1133)。 
 But since there is also PQQ-ALDH (2) genes in difficult these bacterial strains for generating D-Glucose diacid, to pass through
Make PQQ-ALDH (2) activity expression, also, implement variation to reduce or disappear to other ALDH (3) activity, can be changed to be suitable for
