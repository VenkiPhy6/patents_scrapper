Germ (Valsa ambiens Pers), G jujube alternaria (Alternaria sp.), H eggplant corruption reaping hook germ (Fusarium
Solani.), X melon and fruit corruption mould (Pythium aphanidermatum), Y Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn (Rhizoctonia solani): 
 (1) activation of bacterial strain: one environmental protection of picking is stored in the ZF02 on nutrient agar panel and lines on nutrient agar panel,
20h is cultivated at 37 DEG C, one ring phytopathogen of picking lines in PDA culture medium, cultivates 5d at 28 DEG C. 
 (2) the pure bacterium colony tricyclic of ZF02 obtained in picking step (1) is inoculated in 50mL beef extract-peptone fluid nutrient medium
In, the bacterium solution after fermentation is centrifuged 10min through 5000r/min, takes supernatant, through 0.22 μm by 37 DEG C, 150r/min culture 72h
Membrane filtration removes thallus, the sterile ferment filtrate of ZF02 is made. 
 (3) the sterile 200 μ L of ferment filtrate of endogenetic bacteria ZF02 is coated on PDA plate, is compareed sterile to be coated with 200 μ L
Water, taking diameter is that the farm-forestry crop pathogen fungus block of 1 × 1cm is put in PDA plate centre, and it is straight to measure bacterium colony by 28 DEG C of culture 5d
Diameter calculates mycelial growth inhibition rate. 
 The calculation formula of mycelial growth inhibition rate is as follows: 
 
 
 
 In formula, B is control farm-forestry crop pathogen colony growth diameter (mm)；T is to plant after applying endogenetic bacteria ferment filtrate
Object pathogen colony growth diameter (mm). 
 By measurement result it is found that referring to attached drawing 5, ZF02 bacterial strain is to the operatic circle alternaria, pears rotten pathogenic bacteria, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn
With melon and fruit it is rotten it is mould have preferable bacteriostasis, mycelial growth inhibition rate is respectively 73.13%, 35.75%, 61.42% He
15.50%, after measured, ZF02 is rotten to the operatic circle alternaria, pears rotten pathogenic bacteria, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn and melon and fruit mould to have very strong inhibition
Effect. 
 By above-mentioned series embodiment, according to by Hanshan Normal College, phoenix is single from Guangdong Province Chaozhou Raoping County town Fu Bin
It is sampled in clump Stem of Tea, sample is the stem of tea tree, is collected in Guangdong Province Chaozhou Raoping County town Fu Bin, the age of tree 15,25 and 50 years, plants
Height above sea level 750m is planted, tea tree breed is phoenix Dan Congcha narcissus, organic plantation, by isolating stem using tissue mass cell culture
Middle endogenetic bacteria filters out the well-grown bacterium bacterium of a batch using different cultivation temperatures, pH value, culture medium as enrichment condition
Strain therefrom preferably goes out the bacterial strain that one plant of number is ZF02.By according to the above morphological feature, reference " primary Jie Shi Bacteria Identification hand
Volume " and " common bacteria identification handbook " to bacterial strain carry out taxonomic identification, and binding molecule biology be sequenced, the Preliminary Identification bacterial strain
For pseudomonad (Pseudomonas sp.).Show pseudomonad (Pseudomonas sp.) through molecule sequencing result
The 16SrDNA gene order of ZF02GDMCC No:60013 is 1439bp, with ncbi database Pseudomonas
Fluorescens NBRC 14160 (NR_113647.1) homology highest, highest similitude are 94%, but provided by the invention
