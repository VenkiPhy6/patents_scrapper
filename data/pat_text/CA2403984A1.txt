Meningococcal meningitis is of particular importance as a worldwide health problem and in many countries the incidence of infection is increasing.     Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus) is the organism that causes the disease and is also responsible for meningococcal septicaemia, which is associated with rapid onset and high mortality, with around 22% of cases proving fats I.     The meningacoccal transferrin receptor is a suitable vaccine component and made up of two types of component protein chain, transferrin binding protein A (TbpA) and TbpB. The receptor complex is proposed to be formed from a dimer of TbpA which associates with a single TbpB. Epitopes present in TbpA are known to be masked within the interior of the protein. Vaccines against meningococcal disease based on TbpB from one strain alone show some cross reactivity and there is evidence of a cross-reactive immune response in rabbits immunised with TbpB alone. Obtaining Tbps from natural bacterial sources carries the difficulty of obtaining adequate quantities for industrial vaccine production, together with the near impossibility of culturing large volumes of meningococci under safe conditions.      It would therefore be desirable to produce the Tbps recombinantly.      Recombinant production of TbpB is known, providing large amounts of the recombinant protein, extracted from inclusion bodies using conventional techniques.      TbpA is one of a family of proteins referred to as Tong-dependent outer membrane receptors, due to their physical location in the Neisserial membrane and their functional interaction with Tong. TbpB is, not Tong-dependent but is added to this group for the purpose of the present application due to its interaction with TbpA in forming the transferrin receptor. This group thus includes Tbps and lactoferrin binding proteins and wiil be referred to as a whole as the iron -2_ uptake proteins.  A difficulty in known methods of recombinantly producing iron uptake proteins is that the resultant proteins are recovered in non-native conformations, undesirable in vaccines based thereon. Another problem is that some iron uptake proteins can not hitherto be made recombinantly, and this is notably the case for TbpA.      Recombinant production of TbpB in E. coii is known' from Legrain et al, "Production of lipidated meningococcal transferrin binding protein 2 in Escherichia coli", Protein Expression and Purification 6, 570-578 (1995). This describes an expression system for production of TbpB and fermenter cultures but does not describe TbpB purification. The TbpB is said to be located in the insoluble fraction of the cellular extracts, indicating that the protein is in an insoluble form, i.e. in inclusion bodies. Lissolo et al, in Infection and Immunity, 63:884-90 (1995) describes purification of TbpB from the meningococcus using denaturing conditions. Renauld-Mongenie et al, in J Bacteriol., 179:6400-7 (1997) describes expression of TbpB as maltose binding protein-TbpB fusions, and then purification in 3M      Urea buffer using the afFinity system for maltose binding proteins.      Gonzalez et al, in Microbiology, 141:2405-16 (1995) describes how Actino,6acilius pleuropneUmoniae TbpA and TbpB are eluted from transferrin Sepharose with a denaturing buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol.      Palmer et al, in FEMS Microbiology Letters, volume 110, pp 139-146, 1993, purport to describe TbpA expression in E.coii. However, Palmer et al were not able to recover TbpA in a functional form. The invention has as an object the provision of improved methods of production of iron uptake proteins, in particular transferrin binding proteins, and specific objects of providing alternative and/or improved recombinant production of such proteins and of providing recombinant production ofTbpA. Afurther object of the invention is to provide improved preparation of vaccines containing transferrin binding proteins. A first aspect of the invention is based upon successful recombinant expression of transferrin binding proteins and confirmation that the transferrin binding proteins expressed retain the antigenicity of native transferrin binding proteins, as evidenced by ability of the recombinantly produced proteins to bind human transferrin and confer protective immunity against challenge by meningococci. Accordingly, the invention provides a non-neisserial cell expressing a neisserial iron uptake protein, wherein the iron uptake protein can be extracted from the cell under mild conditions and retains substantially the antigenicity of native iron uptake protein. The invention further provides a non-neisserial cell expressing a neisserial iron uptake protein wherein the iron uptake protein is located in a surface membrane of the cell. In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a non-neisserial cell expressing a Neisserial transferrin binding protein (Tbp) wherein said Tbp can be extracted from the cell under mild conditions and retains substantially the antigenicity of native TbpA. The invention additionally provides a cell overexpressing a neisserial iron uptake protein.    The iron uptake protein is preferably selected from the group consisting of transferrin binding proteins (Tbps), lactoferrin binding proteins (Lbps), haemoglobin binding protein, enterobactin binding protein, vibriobactin binding protein, ferric siderophore binding protein, hems binding protein, hemin binding protein, chrysobactin binding protein, hydroxymate binding protein and pseudobactin binding protein - some of these proteins also being referred to as "receptor"s rather than "binding protein"s. Also provided is a cell which expresses a neisserial Tbp, wherein the yield of said Tbp is at feast 4mg per litre of culture, preferably at least 7mg and more preferably at least 10mg. In these embodiments of the invention, the cell is preferably bacterial and the Tbp can be A or B.     TbpA is expressed in an example at a yield of from about 6 to about 12mg per litre of culture. In addition, the invention is hence of application to overexpression of Tbps in organisms that are known to express Tbps. In this sense, "overexpression" is intended to mean expression in a cell of a protein that is not in nature expressed in that cell as well as expression in a cell of a protein that is expressed in that cell in nature but at a lower level, the invention in this latter case resulting in expression of that protein at a higher level. 0verexpression in, for example, commensal neisseria is of use as outer membrane preparations enriched in Tbps or containing heterologous Tbps can be obtained therefrom, and are advantageously used in vaccines. A specific embodiment lies in a commensal Neisseria expressing an iron uptake protein from a pathogenic Neisseria, especially one expressing TbpA and/or TbpB. In use of the invention, TbpA has been found to be expressed so that it is located on or associated with the cell surface, and thus expressed with any necessary trafificking signals so that the TbpA gene product ends up on or associated with __20.. ._ ._the..surface...~Fu _rther_, the TbpA_ expressed_can-Basil-y-be-extracted_using-,~ni.ld..-. conditions, such as using a conventional detergent extraction method, whilst retaining the antigenicity and hence the properties relevant to vaccinating use of native protein. By mild conditions it is meant that recombinant protein can be extracted without the need to denature and then renature the protein. (f the protein were located in inclusion bodies there would be a need to employ more severe recovery techniques, typically involving denaturing of the protein. However, an advantage of the invention is that the protein is surface bound or associated, and is not sequestered in inclusion bodies, so extraction does not require this denaturing, with its consequent damage to the confirmation of the protein and potential loss of key epitopes. It is an option also to produce TbpB recombinantly, and thus the invention also provides a cell expressing, recombinantly, both TbpA and TbpB. This confers the advantage of using a single cell for two important vaccine components.     In an example below, TbpB has been expressed at a yield of from about 7 to about 32mg per litre of culture. , The desired antigenicity in, by way of example, the TbpA and TbpB obtained from cells of the invention is antigenicity that stimulates an immune response against Tbp and organisms expressing Tbp. The proteins obtained in examples of the invention have been tested in animal models and the extracted Tbp demonstrated to confer protection against subsequent challenge by meningococci, this confirming Tbp in a substantially native confirmation has been obtained. This has the advantage of providing an efficient route of recombinant production of these proteins for subsequent use for example in further structure-function analysis and pharmaceutical, particularly vaccine, applications.    The invention also relates to methods of iron uptake protein production and provides, in a second aspect, a method of producing an iron uptake protein by expressing a recombinant iron uptake protein gene in a non-neisserial cell host such that the protein is expressed and translocated to a surface membrane of the host. The protein can then be extracted using mild conditions. The invention also relates specifically to methods of Tbp production and provides a method of producing a neisserial transferrin binding protein (Tbp) comprising: a. expressing a recombinant neisserial Tbp gene in a non-neisserial host such that Tbp protein is expressed and translocated to the cell membrane; b. under mild conditions, extracting Tbp protein.    The method can also include expressing recombinant neisserial TbpA and TbpB genes, in the same culture and optionally in the same cell. A still further embodiment of the invention resides in a method of producing a transferrin binding protein (Tbp) from a pathogenic Neisseria, comprising expressing a gene encoding the ,Tbp in a commensal Neisserial host such that Tbp protein is translocated to an outer surface membrane of the commensal host, extracting the Tbp under mild conditions, and, optionally, purifying said Tbp protein. An outer membrane vesicle preparation is suitable, for example for vaccine preparation, and a N. meningitidisgene expressed in N. lactamica is particularly suitable.     The Tbp is suitably extracted by solubilising membrane associated Tbp in a non-ionic detergent solution, yielding good quantities of Tbp in native form and which has been demonstrated to be both functional and protective against meningococcal challenge. A number of non-ionic detergents are suitable for the extraction, including one chosen from an alkyl glucoside; n-octyl-(3-D glucopyranoside; TRITON°X100; ELUGENT~; dodecyl-maltoside; and n-octyl-(3 D-maltoside. The extraction preferably includes a low energy homogenisation step, conveniently preceded by using apparatus such as a bead-beating apparatus, though other such apparatus are also available, to break up cells and isolate cell membranes, To obtain the desired location of expressed protein, an expression construct is preferably used that combines a nucleotide sequence encoding the iron uptake protein with a leader sequence directing the expressed protein to a surface membrane of the host, this construct forming a further embodiment of the invention. The leader sequence is suitably a neisserial leader sequence, and good results have been obtained in specific examples below where the neisserial iron uptake protein is expressed using its own neisserial leader sequence. TbpA has been expressed using the TbpA leader. Another option is to use a host leader sequence that directs translocation of the recombinant product to a surface membrane of the host, for example an E.coli leader if the protein is made in E. coli. TbpB has been expressed using a host leader.     Once protein has been obtained from the cells expressing the protein it is preferred to subject the crude product obtained to one or more purification processes. These processes may remove such contaminants as other proteins from the host cell, non-proteinaceous contaminants and also other components of the cell. The crude product can be purified by affinity chromatography, and preferably in the case of Tbps using a transferrin-bound affinity matrix. In this respect, reference to transferrin encompasses fragments, variants and derivatives of human transferrin that retain transferrin's binding to Tbps. A further aspect of the invention, described in more detail below, relates to recombinant transferrin, and the affinity matrix preferably comprises recombinant human transferrin. A third aspect of the invention ties in a method of preparing a vaccine, comprising obtaining TbpA, TbpB or TbpA and TbpB according to the invention and combining said Tbp with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention _7_ further provides use of a cell according to the invention in manufacture of Tbp, and use of a cell according to the invention in manufacture of a vaccine for protection against neisserial disease and/or meningococcal disease. As described in examples below in more detail, transferrin binding proteins have been expressed recombinantly in E.coli. The invention is nevertheless of application to a range of host cell types, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, such as yeast (eg. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris), insect cells (eg. baculovirus expression system), gram positive bacterial expression systems (eg.    Bacillus subtilis) and mammalian cell culture. The expression vectors used in the invention have been designed for use in E.coliand corresponding vectors can be designed for use in other bacterial hosts, subject to selection of suitable promoters and origins of replication according to the host cell chosen.  Examples of suitable cloning techniques and other hosts are described, for example, in Sambrook et al "Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual", 1989. The iron uptake proteins expressed according to the invention are derived from Neisseria. In the specific embodiments, transferrin binding proteins from pathogenic Neisseria, specifically lV.meningitidis, have been expressed, more specifically of strain K454. Other neisserial transferrin binding proteins may suitably be expressed according to the invention, whether from virulent or avirulent strains and also from commensal strains. By reference to "iron uptake proteins"and "transferrin binding protein" it is intended to include whole, intact protein and also fragments and derivatives and variants thereof, provided that said fragments, derivatives and variants when administered in a vaccinating composition confer protection against subsequent challenge by meningococci and/or gonococci. It is a significant advantage of the invention that it is now possible to produce iron uptake proteins and especially transferrin binding proteins in conformation suitable for vaccines and in useful quantities using the recombinant techniques of the invention. A fourth aspect of the invention provides a method of purifying a Tbp-containing preparation, comprising eluting the preparation through an affinity matrix comprising immobilized transferrin.     -$_ A benefit of this method is that the affinity matrix will only bind functional transferrin binding protein, as only functional protein will bind to the immobilised transferrin. In this respect, reference to transferrin encompasses fragments, variants and derivatives of transferrin that retain transferrin's binding to Tbps. Thus, the eluate is both purified in respect of proteins that are not transferrin binding proteins and is also purified in that transferrin binding protein which is non-functional, mutated or otherwise does not bind transferrin passes through the matrix. It is preferred that human transferrin binding protein be immobilised, more preferably recombinant human transferrin binding protein, which confers a particular benefit in that the purified Tbp and hence preparation of a vaccine for human use is simplified as exclusive processes for removal of these contaminants can be avoided. A further aspect of the invention provides an affinity matrix for purification of Tbps comprising human recombinant transferrinor a fragment thereof that binds to Tbp. The transferrin may be produced according to a method of the invention described below. Typically, Tbp is expressed in a host cell and an extract of membrane-bound or membrane-associated Tbp obtained, such as using the mild extraction conditions described above. This extract, a crude Tbp-containing extract, is passed through the matrix, Tbp that can bind immobilized transferrin or fragment thereof is retained whilst non-functional Tbp and other contaminants pass through. The purified Tbp can then be separated from the matrix using conventional techniques, such as fow pH. A further composition of the invention contains a Tbp, wherein at least 90 per cent by weight of said Tbp is active Tbp. The Tbp can be A or B, and by active is meant that the Tbp binds to transferrin. The composition is preferably free of Tbp that is not capable of binding transferrin.  For purification of Tbps, recombinant human transferrin can be obtained by:   A. obtaining a clone of human transferrin, or a fragment or derivative thereof;      B. inserting said clone, or fragment or derivative thereof, into an expression vector;      C. expressing the vector in a suitable host organism; and _g_ D. isolating the expressed gene product from said host organism. The clone can be isolated via a PCR based method, and the expression vector can be selected from the group consisting of pMTL and pET. The host organism is typically a bacterium, suitably E. coli, and specific embodiments ofthe invention use a host selected from the group consisting of Novablue DE3; HMS 174 DE3;      BL21 DE3; JM 109; RV 308; and XL1 Blue.     The invention is now described in specific embodiments, illustrated by the accompanying drawings in which:-Fig. 1 shows analysis of purified rTbps by SDS-PAGE (10%) under different denaturing conditions;  Fig. 2 shows purified rTbps electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies raised against native Tbps and hTf-HRP conjugate;     Fig. 3 shows protection against IP challenge with lV.meningitidisstrain K454 conferred by rTbpA and rTbpB; and Fig.4 shows flow cytometry analysis indicating the surface location of expressed Tbps.     In more detail, for Figure 1, a 10% SDS-PAGE gel of rTbps was stained with Gelcode blue. M is Pharmacia low range molecular weight markers, H is rTbp boiled at 100 degrees C for 5-minutes before loading onto the gel, UH is rTbp not heated before loading onto the gel. For Figure 2, rTbps were run on 10%      SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. M is Biorad prestained molecular weight markers. A consistent pattern of degradation products is seen for batches of rTbpA and rTbpB when probed with serum to the native protein. For rTbpA the same pattern of bands is also seen when human transferrin HRP is used to probe the membrane. In Figure 3, the number of survivors per group of 20 mice is shown against days from intraperitoneal challenge by N. meningitidis strain K454. The challenge dose for the upper panel was 5 x 106 and for the lower was 5 x 10'' In Figure 4, surface labelling of E.coii JM109 with HTf-FITC is illustrated as counts shown against FITC .     tbp Gene Cloning and Expression Primers to amplify N, meningitidis strain K454 (B15:P1.7,16) tbps were designed using information from other sequenced N, meningitidis tbpgenes in the Genbank database (and subsequent sequencing of the N and C termini of each tbp gene). 5' primers engineered an Ndel (CATATG) site at the ATG start codon, and 3' primers contained a BamHl ( tbpA) or EcoRl ( tbp~ site after the stop codon, 5' tbpA TTAGGGAAACCATATGCAACAGCAAC 3' tbpA GACGGATCCGCGTTTGGACGTTTAAAACTTC 5' tbpB GAATTGGATTTCATATGAACAATCC 3' tbpB GACGAATTCCGGCAGCCGTGCTTATCGC      Restriction sites in bold. tbpB was further modified by replacing the native TbpB leader peptide coding sequence with that of the E.coli RIpB lipoprotein. Genes were cloned into pET22b (Novagen) initially, on an Ndel-BamHl (tbpA) or Ndel-EcoRl (r'ipB:: tbpB) fragment and both strands of each clone sequenced to confirm gene integrity. These same fragments were subsequently subcloned into various pMTL vectors from which optimum expression was rouna m plVl I LLU I V (incorporating a iaclJV5 promoter driving expression and a tetracycline resistance gene). Plasmid constructs were used to transform a variety of DE3 lysogens for pET22b directed expression (E,coii Novablue DE3, HMS 174 DE3 and BL21 DE3). pMTL2010 clones were used to transform E.coli JM109 and RV308 strains for expression.     We succeeded in expressing TbpA from all vectors, except from pMTL1015 and 2015 under the control of the mdh promoter which is stronger than the iacUV5 promoter. This suggests that strong gene expression causes toxicity. However, the rate of transcription in the pET expression system is greater than would be expected using mdh promoter driven expression, but no studies have been done to address this question. tbpA expressed better in BL21 DE3 than Novablue DE3 when cloned into pET vectors. Replacement of the native neisserial TbpA leader sequence with that of CPG2 and PeIB leaders still gave rise to active protein (in terms of hTf binding) but offered no improvement over the native neisserial leader.      Sequence data for lV.meningitidis strain K454 tbpA are shown below.      Production of recombinant meningococcal Tbps in E.coli 1. Growth of recombinant E.coli strains Recombinant E.co/istrains (JM109 containing CAMR pMTLvectors with either tbpA or tbpB gene inserted) were grown up in 8 litre fermenters. Soytone based production medium containing the appropriate antibiotic (either 1.25mgh tetracycline or 100mg/I ampicillin) was used (see table 1 ). The fermenters were maintained at a temperature of 37°C with an air flow of 0.5 vessel volumes per minute and a pH of 6.8-7. The dissolved oxygen tension was maintained at >40% by agitation. The cultures were allowed to grow until an A600nm of approximately 10 was reached, at which point Tbp expression was induced by the addition of 1PTG to a final concentration of l.OmM. Cultures were then allowed to grow for a further 6-8 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation s and the wet weight was determined.      Table 1 Components of Soytone Based medium Medium Ingredient                 Amount (g/1) Bacto Soytone                     40 K2HP0~.                        4 CaC12.2H20                        0.01 K2S04              2.6 Yeast extract                  3 Glycerol                   41 Trace elements                    5m1 1 M MgC12.6H20 1 ml Mazu DF8005 0.1 ml Ampicillin/Tetracycline 100mg/1.25mg 2. Preparation of whole cell suspension Recombinant E.coli cells harvested from fermenters were resuspended in 100mM Tris-HCI bufFer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5M NaCI. Cells were resuspended at 10 % (w/v) and a hand held glass homogenises was used to obtain an even suspension. For a typical experiment 40g of cells were used and resuspended in 400m1 of buffer.      Two methods were used to obtain soluble recombinant transferrin binding proteins (rTbps) for affinity purification from the above cell suspension.  
 3. Extraction of Tbps 3.1 Procedure A. Direct extraction from whole cells An equal volume of 100mM Tris-HCL buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5M NaCI and 4% (v/v) ElugentTM detergent (Calbiochem) was added to the whole cells and mixed thoroughly.     The suspension was incubated with gentle stirring at 4°C for 16 h and then centrifuged at 39000 g for 40 min to remove bacteria) debris. The supernatant containing soluble rTbps was gently decanted off in preparation for affinity chromatography. 3.2 Procedure B. Extraction from membrane preparations Crude membranes were prepared by disrupting cells with a bead-beater (Biospec Products, OK, US.). The cell suspension was transferred to a vessel half filled with 0.25-0.5mm diameter glass beads. The vessel was sealed and placed on to the bead-beating apparatus. The suspension was beaten for 15 seconds to disrupt the cells. Once the beads had settled the suspension was decanted oft and centrifuged at 8000g for 30 min. The supernatant Was discarded and the pellet containing crude membranes was resuspended in the original volume of 100 mM     Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8,0, containing 0.5M NaCI. Once an even suspension was obtained an equal volume of Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5M NaCI and 4% (v/v) ElugentTM detergent was added. The suspension was incubated with gentle stirring at 4°C for 16 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 39000g for 40 min and the supernatant containing soluble rTbps was decanted off in preparation for affinity chromatography. 4. Preparation of transferrin-Sepharose affinity matrix Transferrin-Sepharose affinity matrix was prepared using cyanogen bromide (CNBr) activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech) and human transferrin (Sigma). Transferrin purified from human blood will eventually be replaced with recombinant transferrin produced in E.coli. 15g of CNBR activated Sepharose was suspended in 200 ml of 1 mM HCI and was washed for l5min with another 21 of the same solution on a sintered glass filter. 0.36g of human transferrin were dissolved in 50m1 coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHC03, pH 8.3, containing 0.5M NaCI) and mixed with the washed Sepharose 4B. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle mixing. Excess uncoupled transferrin was then washed away with 250 ml of coupling buffer and remaining active groups were blocked by incubating with 0.1 MTris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0, for 2h. The transferrin-Sepharose was then washed with 3 cycles of low and high pH buffer using 250m1 of buffer for each wash. The low pH buffer was 0.1 M acetate, pH 4.0, and the high pH buffer was 0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 8. Both contained 0.5M NaCI. The transferrin-Sepharose was stored at 4°C in Tris-HCI, pH 8, until use.  
 5. Affinity Chromatography Supernatants containing rTbp A or rTbpB were loaded on to a 10m1 column of human transferrin linked to Sepharose 4B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For rTbpB  the column was saturated with iron by passing 200m1 of iron saturation buffer (40mM Tris, 2mM NaHC03, 25mM Na citrate and 1 mM FeS04.7H20)through the column. For rTbpA this step was not necessary. The column was then washed with 20 column volumes of 1 OOmM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5M NaCI to remove unbound material. rTbps were eluted from the column using 50mM glycine buffer, pH 2.0, containing 0.5M NaCI and 0.5-2% (v/v) ElugentTnn detergent. Fractions containing rTbps were roughly located by monitoring the absorbance at 280nm. As the ElugentTM also absorbs at 280nm, the presence of rTbps in selected fractions was confirmed by human transferrin-HRP (hTf-HRP) ligand blot and SDS-PAGE analysis. Fractions containing rTbps were pooled and applied to a HiPrep Desalting column (Sephadex G-25, Pharmaci.a) to partially remove glycine and free ElugentTM. The protein concentration was then determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.  
 6. Transferrin-HRP ligand blot Transferrin-HRP ligand blot was carried out to accurately locate the presence of rTbps in eluted fractions and confirmed that active protein was being recovered.  A series of eight two-fold dilutions was prepared using a 50u1 sample of each selected fraction and 5u1 of each spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 1%(w/v) dried skimmed milk powder for 1 hour. After washing in PBST for 3 x 10min the membrane was incubated in hTf-HRP conjugate (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) diluted to 1 ug/ml in PBST for 2h. After further washing, as above, the membrane was developed in 4-chloronaphthol substrate.  
 7. Results 7.1 Yields of Tbps A range of detergents was investigated and compared to Elugent for their ability to solubilise and stabilise the rTbps. Of the nine examined octyl glucopyranoside and dodecyl maltoside Were the most suitable alternatives for use.   The yields of rTbps from E.eoli JM109 clones containing CAMR pMTL expression vectors were as follows:-rTbpA      Vector wet weight rTbp/g cells protein/litre (pMTL) cells/litre (ug/g) culture culture (g) (mg) 2000      19            306           5.8 2003      52'*          252           ND     2010      23    350           8.0 2010      22            537           11.8 (no tet) rTbpB     Vector wet weight rTbp/g protein/litre (pMTL) cells/litre cells culture culture (g) (ug/g) (mg) 2000 33 880 29.0 2003 29 238 6.9 2010 42 690 28.9 2010 35 890 31.1 (no tet) *' this cell pellet was very sloppy due to cell lysis and the wet weight value is therefore an over estimate.     ND - this value could not be calculated as actual wet weight is not known.     Samples of E.co/iJM109 clones expressing, respectively, tbpA and tbpB were deposited at ECACC on 24 January 2000 under accession numbers 00012404 and '00012405, respectively.  Yields were estimated from 40g samples of cells taken from paste grown in 2 x soytone medium in 8 litre fermenters. Tbps were extracted at 4°C using procedure A and purified on a transferrin-Sepharose column. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA assay. Vectors pMTL2000 and pMTL2003 have the ampicillin resistance marker and vector pMTL2010 has the tetracycline resistance marker. Values in the last row for each Tbp with pMTL2010 are for no antibiotic present in the medium. 7.2 Characterisation of rTbps 7.2.1 SDS-PAGE analysis of purified rTbps Purified rTbps were analysed by SDS-PAGE (10%) under different denaturing conditions (Figure 1 ). Full length rTbpA had a MW of approximately 1 OOkDa and constituted > 90% of tots! protein as determined by densitometry of the coomassie stained gel. When not heated before SDS-PAGE two major bands of slightly lower MW were apparent which may represent membrane inserted and unprocessed forms of rTbpA. Full length rTbpB had a MW of approximately 85kDa and constituted ~ 80% of total protein as determined by densitometry.     There was no difference in the SDS-PAGE profile of the heated and unheated protein. 7.2.2 Western blot of rTbps After SDS-PAGE, purified rTbps were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with antibodies raised against native Tbps or hTf-HRP conjugate (Figure 2). Like the native proteins purified from N.meningitidis, rTbpB binds hTf-HRP after SDS-PAGE and Western blot whereas rTbpA does not. A consistent pattern of low MW bands is seen for both rTbpA and rTbpB. These appear immediately after induction and when strains are grown at low temperatures and are most likely the result of in vivo proteolytic degradation of the full length rTbps. If they can be characterised and quantified they may not need to be removed from a vaccine preparation and may indeed contribute to protection afforded by the recombinant proteins. 7.3 Protection provided by recombinant Tbps against meningococcal challenge in mice.      Harlan-NIH mice were immunised on days 0, 21 and 28 with 10~g per dose of rTbpA,'r rTbp or rTbpA+rTbpB in Freund's adjuvant. Mice were then given an intraperitoneal challenge of N. meningitidis strain K454 containing 10mg of iron-saturated human transferrin on day 35. A further dose of human transferrin is given by intraperitoneal injection after 24h. The numbers of surviving mice are then recorded for 4 days.

We have expressed individual lobes of the transferrin protein, along with full length protein.   Human transferrin was cloned by PCR amplification of an existing gene clone (cDNA sequence Funmei Yang et al., (1984) PNAS 81: 2752-2756). Before use, the internal /Vdel sites present in the hTf gene were removed by mutagenic PCR, as follows: 1. PCR amplification of the transferrin with the oligomers below removed the first lVdel site at amino acids 25 - 26, without changing the amino acid sequence.  An lVrc.il site is included in the 5' primer, enabling the product to be cloned into a previously engineered version of hTf containing an lVrul site just upstream of the /Vdel site (also engineered without changing the amino acid sequence).

Removal of the second /Vdel site was a two step process: firstly, a version of hTf was generated containing an appropriately placed Pvul site in it (amino acids 642 - 645). The Pvul site was introduced by PCR amplification of hTf lacking the upstream /Vdel site (generated as detailed above) with the following oligomers Primers for introducing Pvul site into hTf 5' CAT ATG GTC CCT GAT AAA ACT GTG AG 3' (5' primer) 5' CGA TCG TGA AGT TTG GCC AAA CAT ACT G 3' (3' primer) Then the 3' end of hTf was amplified using the following oligomers:      Primers for removing 3' (downstream) lVdel site 5' CGA TCG AAA CAC GTA TGA AAA ATA CTT AG 3' (5' primer) 5' GTT CTA GAG TGG CAG CCC TAC CTC TGA G 3' (3' primer) 3. The Pvul sites were used to join the two products together, forming a full length recombinant hTf gene with a single /Vdel site at the level of the start ATG codon.      The N terminal clone was prepared by PCR, using the oligomers below, generating an N terminus clone without the native leader sequence, encompassing amino acids 1 - 337 of the mature transferrin sequence.

C terminus clone primers 5' CAT ATG GAA TGC AAG CCT GTG AAG TGG 3' (5' primer) 5' GTT CTA GAG TGG CAG CCC TAC CTC TGA G 3' (3' primer) Full-length and hTf lobes were cloned into pET22b and pET26b, initially, on an lVdel-Xbal fragment.      Expression Studies Expression studies were carried out by growing E, coli BL21 DE3 carrying the hTf pET22b and pET26b clones, to OD65o 0.7-1Ø Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG and hTf production monitored over the course of two hours by dot blot and Western blotting, using a goat anti-human transferrin polyclonal antibody (Sigma). The size of full length and C terminus recombinant matched that expected for ungiycosylated human transferrin and its individual lobes. Microscope examination revealed that expression of hTf resulted in the production of inclusion bodies. This precipitated material requires solubilisation and refolding in order to generate functional material.      E~CAM PLE 3 Recombinant transferrin refolding and preparation of affinity column The protocol for solubilisation and refolding is described in (Hoefkins P., et al. (1996) Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 28, 975-982. Briefly, the protocol is:-1. Isolate inclusion body material by standard cell lysis and centrifugation. 2. Dissolve pelleted protein in 8M urea, 1 mM DTT, 40 mM Tris/HCI, 10%  glycerol (v/v) pH7.6. 3. Dilute dissolved protein in renaturation buffer (0.1 mM Na-EDTA, 0.1 mM      Tris/HCI, 1.0 mM reduced glutathione (GSH), pH 8.2) to a concentration of 20~g/ml. 4. Incubate at 6°C for 15 min. 5. Add oxidised glutathione (GSSG) to a final concentration of 0.5mM. 6. Incubate for further 22hr at 6 °C. 7. Concentrate and dialyse against 10mM NaHC03.  
 8. Saturate with iron and assess purity (where necessary, clean up using size exclusion chromatography or other chromatographic technique).  
 9. Conjugate with Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia) to generate affinity matrix. The resultant transferrin affinity column is used to purify recombinant Tbps from Example 1.        Protective effect of recombinant Tbps Groups of 20 mice were inoculated with rTbpA, rTbpB, both rTbpA and rTbpB, or a control of no vaccine. Their survival was monitored following challenge by 5x106 and 5x10' N.meningitidis strain K454 and the results illustrated in figure 3. rTbpA and rTbpB conferred protection against challenge, confirming antigenicity of native Tbp had been retained in the recombinant proteins. In more detail, both rTbpA and rTbpB provide strong protection against meningococcal challenge, with greater protection provided by TbpA at the higher challenge dose:  Protection with TbpA has not been previously reported. The combination of TbpA+TbpB is also protective and may provide the most effective vaccine against a range of challenge strains.        Surface ex ression of recombinant Tb s E.coii expressing recombinant Tbps are probed with fluorescently labelled human transferrin, with the results being shown in Figure 4. It is seen that the parent E. coli strain and the uninduced strains possessing the Tbp gene show little fluorescence. The induced E. coil peak is shifted to the right on the X-axis, indicating increased fluorescence caused by binding of the labelled human tran.sferin to the bacteria, indicating location of the recombinant Tbps on the bacterial surface.     Cross-reactivity of antisera raised against rTbpA and rTb~.~B Whole-cell ELISA studies are carried out using a range of patient isolates collected in Norway to assess the cross-reactivity of antisera raised against rTbpA and rTbpB with Tbps expressed by these isolates, with the results being shown in table 2.

Geometric mean of the reciprocal titer from five separate animals. Where no antibody was detected (e.g., preimmune sera [data not shown]), an arbitrary titer of 50 was assigned. The mean values are 10,408 for the TbpA group and 1,573 for the TbpB group. It is seen that titers against isolates of a variety of different sera groups, sera types and serosubtypes were consistently higher for antisera raised against rTbpA  than for antisera raised against rTbpB.      Three isolates expressing low-molecular mass TbpB and the rTbpB antiserum showed reaction with these cells. Pre-immune sera from these mice showed no reaction with the meningococcal isolates. The invention thus provides recombinant expression of iron uptakes proteins and compositions, vaccines and uses based thereon.
