 Technical Field 
 The present disclosure relates to novel protein variants having tryptophan export activity, microorganisms expressing the protein variants that produce L-tryptophan, and methods of producing L-tryptophan using the microorganisms. 
 
 
 Background 
 Tryptophan, which is an essential amino acid, has been widely used as a raw material for feed additives, medicines (e.g., infusion solutions), health food materials, and the like. At present, a direct fermentation method using microorganisms is mainly used for producing L-tryptophan. 
 Previously, selected strains exhibiting resistance to analogues by chemical or physical mutation have been mainly used as microorganisms producing L-tryptophan. However, with the rapid development of the gene recombination technology and the identification of molecular level regulatory mechanisms in the 90 th century of the 20 th year, recombinant strains have been mainly used by using genetic engineering techniques.  
 Meanwhile, expression of genes capable of outputting specific amino acids has been helpful in increasing the yield of corresponding amino acids in microorganisms. Enhancement of the expression of the L-lysine export gene (lysE) in microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium (genus Corynebacterium) has increased the yield of lysine (WO 9723597A 2). In addition, enhancement of the rhtC gene in E.coli (E.coli) has improved resistance to L-threonine and, at the same time, has also improved the yields of L-homoserine, L-threonine and L-leucine (EP 1013765A 1). In addition, patent No. EP1016710B1 discloses that the productivity of L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, L-threonine, L-alanine, L-histidine, L-proline, L-arginine, L-valine and L-isoleucine is improved by enhancing yahN, yeaS, yfiK and yggA genes, the functions of which have not been identified in E.coli. 
 However, export proteins showing specificity for L-tryptophan have not been reported until recently. Although the yddG gene of E.coli is known, it shows higher specificity for L-phenylalanine than for L-tryptophan (FEMS Microbiol Lett 275 (2007), 312 to 318). In addition, genes for export of L-tryptophan or aromatic amino acids have not been reported in microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium, which are mainly used as strains for producing L-amino acids (J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol.20150Ay; 42 (5): 787 to 797).  
 
 
 Disclosure of Invention 
 [ technical problem ] 
 The inventors of the present disclosure have successfully expressed a novel tryptophan export protein specific for L-tryptophan in L-tryptophan-producing microorganisms, and as a result, they have found that L-tryptophan production is significantly improved. Furthermore, the ability to export the corresponding membrane proteins was further enhanced by the introduction of mutations, which have confirmed that L-tryptophan production was significantly increased. Thus, the present disclosure has been completed. 
 Technical scheme 
 It is an object of the present disclosure to provide protein variants having L-tryptophan output activity wherein at least one amino acid selected from the amino acids corresponding to amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with a hydrophobic or aliphatic amino acid.

 It is yet another object of the present disclosure to provide a method for producing L-tryptophan comprising culturing a microorganism in a medium. 
 It is a further object of the present disclosure to provide the use of protein variants for increasing L-tryptophan production.  
 [ technical Effect ] 
 The inventors of the present disclosure have found a novel export gene specific for L-tryptophan, and have attempted to express the gene in L-tryptophan-producing microorganisms. As a result, they have confirmed that the microorganism can significantly increase the production amount of L-tryptophan compared to its parent strain in which the gene is not expressed, and have also found a protein variant encoded by the gene, which allows the microorganism to more significantly increase the production amount of L-tryptophan, thereby confirming that L-tryptophan can be efficiently produced therethrough.

 Detailed Description 
 Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail. Meanwhile, each of the descriptions and embodiments disclosed in the present disclosure may be applied to each of the different descriptions and embodiments. In other words, all combinations of the various elements disclosed in the present disclosure are included within the scope of the present disclosure. Further, the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited by the detailed description provided below.  
 One aspect of the present disclosure provides a protein variant having L-tryptophan export ability, wherein the protein variant comprises at least one mutation in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1. 
 The mutation may include a mutation in which at least one amino acid selected from 79 th amino acid to 83 rd amino acid from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with a different amino acid. 
 The protein variant may be a protein variant having L-tryptophan export activity in which at least one amino acid selected from amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is replaced with a different amino acid. In particular, the protein variant may be a protein variant having L-tryptophan export activity in which at least one amino acid selected from amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with a hydrophobic amino acid or an aliphatic amino acid. 
 As used herein, the term "L-tryptophan" (which is one of the Î± -amino acids) refers to an essential amino acid that is not synthesized in vivo, and which is of formula C  11  H  12  N  2  O  2  Aromatic L-amino acids of (C). 
 In the present disclosure, "protein having L-tryptophan export ability" or "protein having L-tryptophan export activity" refers to a membrane protein having an activity of specifically exporting L-tryptophan outside the cell.  
 The protein having L-tryptophan export activity may be a protein derived from rhizosphere of the genus helicobacter (Herbaspirillum rhizosphaerae) having L-tryptophan export activity. The protein derived from rhizosphere helicobacter having an L-tryptophan export activity may be, for example, a protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1. A protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 may be used interchangeably with a protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 and a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1. 
 In particular, "rhizosphere rhodospirillum" is a gram negative bacterium belonging to the genus rhodospirillum (genus Herbaspirillum). In korea, rhizosphere grass spirochete, as a strain isolated from Yu Lingdao (ullsung island) or the like, can be isolated from the rhizosphere of soil. 
 In addition, although the protein of the present disclosure having L-tryptophan export activity is defined as a protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, it does not exclude the addition of nonsensical sequences upstream or downstream of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, naturally occurring mutations, or silent mutations thereof, and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that any protein having the same or corresponding activity as the protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 belongs to the protein of the present disclosure having L-tryptophan export activity. Specifically, for example, the protein of the present disclosure having L-tryptophan output activity may be a protein composed of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, or a protein composed of an amino acid sequence having 80%, 90%, 95%, 97% or more homology or identity with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1. In addition, it is apparent that any protein having an amino acid sequence deleted, modified, substituted or added in a part of the sequence may also fall within the scope of the protein to be mutated of the present disclosure as long as the protein has any of the above-described homology or identity and exhibits an effect corresponding to the above-described protein.  
 That is, in the present disclosure, even in the case where it is described as "a protein or polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of a specific SEQ ID NO" or "a protein or polypeptide composed of the amino acid sequence of a specific SEQ ID NO", it is apparent that any protein having an amino acid sequence deleted, modified, substituted or added in part of the sequence may be used in the present disclosure as long as the protein has the same or corresponding activity as that of a polypeptide composed of the amino acid sequence of the corresponding SEQ ID NO. For example, it is obvious that "a polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1" may also belong to "a polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1" as long as the polypeptide has the same or corresponding activity as SEQ ID NO. 1. 
 The protein variant having an L-tryptophan output ability provided in the present disclosure may refer to a variant in which an amino acid at a specific position thereof is substituted in a protein having the above-described L-tryptophan output ability, and the resulting L-tryptophan output ability is more than 100% compared to the L-tryptophan output ability of the protein before mutation. 
 As used herein, the term "variant" refers to a protein in which at least one amino acid differs from the amino acids of the recited sequences in conservative substitutions and/or modifications, but maintains the function and properties of the protein. Variants differ from the identified sequences by substitution, deletion or addition of several amino acids. Such variants can generally be identified by modifying one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence of the above-described proteins and evaluating the properties of the above-described modified proteins. That is, the ability of a variant may be increased, unchanged or decreased relative to its ability to naturally occur protein. In addition, some variants may include variants in which one or more portions (e.g., the N-terminal leader or transmembrane domain) are removed. Other variants may include variants in which portions of the N-and/or C-terminus of the mature protein have been removed. The term "variant" may be used interchangeably with "modification", "modified protein", "modified polypeptide", "mutant", "mutein", "divergent", "variant", etc., but as long as these terms are used to indicate variation, the terms to be used are not limited thereto and any terms may be used. For the purposes of this disclosure, a variant may refer to a variant in which the activity of a mutant protein is increased compared to the activity of the native wild-type or unmodified protein, but the variant is not limited thereto.  
 As used herein, the term "conservative substitution" refers to the substitution of one amino acid for another amino acid having similar structure and/or chemical properties. For example, a variant may retain one or more biological activities while having one or more conservative substitutions. Such amino acid substitutions may generally occur based on similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues. For example, among charged amino acids, positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Among the uncharged amino acids, nonpolar amino acids include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and proline; polar or hydrophilic amino acids include serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; and aromatic amino acids including phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. 
 Further, variants may include deletions or additions of amino acids that have minimal impact on the properties and secondary structure of the polypeptide. For example, the polypeptide may be conjugated to a signal (or leader) sequence at the N-terminus of the protein that directs protein transfer at the time of co-translation or post-translation. Alternatively, the polypeptide may be conjugated to another sequence or linker for identification, purification or synthesis of the polypeptide.  
 The "substitution with a different amino acid" is not limited as long as the substituted amino acid is different from the amino acid before substitution. That is, only the 79 th amino acid (i.e., leucine) at the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with an amino acid other than leucine; substitution of the 80 th amino acid (i.e., serine) at the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 with an amino acid other than serine; substitution of the 81 st amino acid (i.e., leucine) of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 with an amino acid other than leucine; substitution of the 82 nd amino acid (i.e., serine) of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 with an amino acid other than serine; alternatively, the 83 rd amino acid (i.e., isoleucine) at the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with an amino acid other than isoleucine, and "substitution with a different amino acid" is not limited. Meanwhile, when expressed as "a specific amino acid is substituted" in the present disclosure, it is apparent that an amino acid is substituted with an amino acid different from the amino acid before substitution even if it is not specifically stated that the amino acid has been substituted with a different amino acid. 
 Alternatively, the protein variant may be a variant in which at least one of the amino acids at positions 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with an amino acid other than the amino acid before substitution (excluding acidic amino acids and basic amino acids). Alternatively, the protein variant may be a variant having an uncharged amino acid, wherein the substituted amino acid is different from the amino acid before substitution, but the protein variant is not limited thereto.  
 Alternatively, the protein variant may be a variant in which at least one of the amino acids at positions 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with an amino acid between a hydrophobic amino acid and an aliphatic amino acid that is different from the amino acid before substitution. Specifically, the protein variant may be a variant in which at least one of the amino acids at positions 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with any one of the amino acids between a hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acid and an aliphatic amino acid. The aliphatic amino acid may be, for example, an amino acid selected from glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine, but the aliphatic amino acid is not limited thereto. The hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acid may be, for example, an amino acid selected from glycine, methionine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, but the hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acid is not limited thereto. 
 Alternatively, the protein variant may be a variant in which at least one of the amino acids at positions 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with an amino acid different from the amino acid before substitution in the small-sized amino acid, but the protein variant is not limited thereto.  
 As used herein, the term "small-sized amino acid" includes amino acids having a relatively small size (i.e., glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, and asparagine) among 20 amino acids, and in particular, glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, and proline may refer to, but the small-sized amino acids are not limited thereto; and more specifically, the small-sized amino acid may refer to glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, and threonine, but the small-sized amino acid is not limited thereto. 
 Alternatively, the protein variant may be a variant in which at least one amino acid from amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with an amino acid selected from alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine, but the protein variant is not limited thereto. 
 In particular, the substitution in the protein variant by a different amino acid may be one or more substitutions selected from the group consisting of: wherein the 79 th amino acid (i.e., leucine) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with alanine, valine, or isoleucine; wherein the 80 th amino acid (i.e., serine) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with alanine, valine, leucine, or isoleucine; wherein the 81 st amino acid (i.e., leucine) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with alanine, valine, or isoleucine; wherein the 82 nd amino acid (i.e., serine) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with alanine, valine, leucine, or isoleucine; and wherein the 83 rd amino acid (i.e., isoleucine) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with alanine, valine, or leucine, but the substitution is not limited thereto.  
 Thus, the protein variants of the present disclosure have enhanced L-tryptophan export ability as compared to the pre-mutated protein. 
 Obviously, protein variants of the present disclosure (wherein at least one of the amino acids 79 to 83 of SEQ ID NO:1 is substituted with a different amino acid) include protein variants wherein the amino acid at the position corresponding to 79 to 83 is substituted with a different amino acid. 
 One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to identify whether the amino acid at any position in any sequence is an amino acid corresponding to amino acids 79 to 83 of SEQ ID NO. 1 by comparing any sequence with SEQ ID NO. 1 using methods known in the art for confirming sequence alignment, homology or identity. 
 Thus, although not described further herein, it is apparent that the description relating to "amino acids 79 to 83 of SEQ ID NO: 1" may also be a description of "amino acids corresponding to amino acids 79 to 83 of SEQ ID NO: 1" as applied to any sequence (e.g., sequences having 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%, or more identity to SEQ ID NO: 1). 
 For example, a protein variant of the present disclosure may be a protein variant in which an amino acid corresponding to amino acids 79 to 83 is substituted with a different amino acid and has 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95% identity to SEQ ID NO. 1, but the protein variant of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.  
 A protein variant in which one or more of the amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 are replaced with different amino acids may be a protein variant comprising any one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO. 131 to SEQ ID NO. 147; in particular, a protein variant consisting essentially of any one of the amino acid sequences SEQ ID NO. 131 to SEQ ID NO. 147; and more specifically, a protein variant consisting of any one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:131 to SEQ ID NO:147, but the protein variant of the present disclosure is not limited thereto. 
 In addition, the protein variant may comprise any one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO. 131 to SEQ ID NO. 147; or an amino acid sequence in which at least one amino acid selected from the amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is fixed and which has 80% or more homology or identity with SEQ ID NO. 1, but the protein variant is not limited thereto. In particular, mutant polypeptides of the present disclosure may include polypeptides having at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% homology or identity to any of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO. 131 through SEQ ID NO. 147. In addition, it is apparent that any protein having an amino acid sequence deleted, modified, substituted, or added in a sequence portion other than the amino acid at 79 th to 83 rd positions may be included within the scope of the present disclosure as long as the protein has any of the above-described homology or identity and exhibits an effect corresponding to the above-described protein.  
 As used herein, the term "homology" or "identity" refers to the degree of relatedness between two given amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences, and may be expressed as a percentage. These terms "homology" and "identity" are often used interchangeably. 
 Sequence homology or identity of a conserved polynucleotide or polypeptide can be determined by standard alignment algorithms and default gap penalties established by the program used (default gap penalty) can be used therewith. Indeed, sequences of homology or identity may hybridize to each other under moderately or highly stringent conditions along at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the entire sequence or the entire length. Polynucleotides comprising degenerate codons in place of codons are also contemplated in hybridization. 
 Whether any two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences have homology, similarity, or identity can be determined using computer algorithms known in the art (e.g., the "FASTA" program) using default parameters introduced by Pearson et al (1988) [ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA85:2444 ]. Alternatively, it may be determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (1970, J.mol. Biol. 48:443-453) performed in the Needleman program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, rice et al, 2000,Trends Genet.16:276-277) (version 5.0.0 or higher). (including GCG package (Devereux, J. ET AL Nucleic Acids Research 12:387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA (Atschul, [ S. ] [ F. ] [ ET AL, J MOLEC BIOL 215]:403 (1990)), guide to Huge Computers, martin J.Bishop, [ ED., ] Academic Press, san Diego,1994, and [ CARILLO ETA/] (1988) SIAM J Applied Math 48:1073). For example, homology, similarity, or identity can be determined using BLAST or ClustalW from the national center for Biotechnology information (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database.  
 Homology, similarity, or identity between polynucleotides or polypeptides can be determined by comparing given sequence information using GAP computer programs, such as those disclosed by Smith and Waterman (adv. Appl. Math (1981) 2:482), such as those introduced by Needleman et al (J Mol biol.48:443 (1970)). Briefly, the GAP program defines homology, similarity, or identity as the number of similar alignment symbols (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) divided by the total number of symbols for the shorter of the two sequences. Default parameters of the GAP program may include: (1) Binary comparison matrices (including identity value 1 and non-identity value 0) and weighted comparison matrices (Atlas Of Protein Sequence And Structure, national Biomedical Research Foundation, pp.353-358 (1979) or EDNAFULL (an EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC 4.4) substitution matrix) as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds. Gripskov et al, (nucleic acids res.14:6755 (1986)); (2) A penalty of 3.0 for each gap and 0.10 penalty (or gap open penalty) of 10 and a gap extension penalty (gap extension penalty) of 0.5) for each symbol in each gap; and (3) no penalty for end gaps. 
 In addition, whether any two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences have homology, similarity or identity can be confirmed by comparing these sequences by southern hybridization experiments performed under defined stringent conditions, and the appropriate hybridization conditions to be defined can be determined within the scope of the art and by methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., j. Sambrook et al, molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual,2nd Edition,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press,Cold Spring Harbor,New York,1989;F.M.Ausubel et al, current Protocols in Molecular Biology, john Wiley & Sons, inc., new york).  
 As used herein, the term "to be expressed/expressed" with respect to a protein refers to a state in which a target protein is introduced into a microorganism or the target protein is modified to be expressed in a microorganism. When the target protein is a protein present in a microorganism, the term refers to a state in which the activity of the protein is enhanced compared to the activity of its endogenous protein or the activity before modification thereof. For the purposes of this disclosure, a "target protein" may be a variant of a protein having the L-tryptophan export ability described above. 
 In particular, the term "introduction of a protein" means that the microorganism exhibits an activity of a specific protein which it has not originally had, or that the microorganism exhibits an enhanced activity compared to its endogenous protein activity or to the protein activity before modification. For example, the term "introduction of a protein" may mean that a polynucleotide encoding a particular protein is introduced into the chromosome of a microorganism; or introducing a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a specific protein into a microorganism, and thereby allowing the activity of the specific protein to be expressed. In addition, the term "enhancement of activity" means that the activity of a particular protein is enhanced compared to its endogenous activity or its activity prior to modification. The term "endogenous activity" refers to the activity of a specific protein originally possessed by a parent strain before modification in the case where the properties of a microorganism are altered by genetic mutation caused by natural or artificial factors.  
 In particular, in the present disclosure, enhancement of activity may be achieved by one or more methods selected from the group consisting of: a method of increasing the intracellular copy number of a gene encoding a protein variant; a method of introducing a mutation into an expression control sequence of a gene encoding a protein variant; a method of replacing an expression control sequence of a gene encoding a protein variant having an L-tryptophan output activity with a sequence having a strong activity; a method of replacing a gene encoding a native protein having L-tryptophan export activity on a chromosome with a gene encoding a protein variant; a method of further introducing a mutation into a gene encoding a protein having L-tryptophan output activity such that the activity of the protein variant is enhanced; and a method of introducing the protein variant into a microorganism, but the activity-enhancing method is not limited thereto. 
 In the above, the method of increasing the copy number of a gene may be performed in the form of operably linking the gene with a vector or by inserting the gene into the chromosome of a host cell, but the method is not particularly limited thereto. In particular, the copy number of a gene may be increased by introducing a vector into a host cell, wherein the vector (the polynucleotide encoding a protein of the present disclosure is operably linked to the vector and the vector is capable of replication and functioning regardless of the host cell) is introduced into the host cell. Alternatively, the copy number of the gene may be increased by introducing a vector (a polynucleotide operably linked to the vector and the vector being capable of inserting the polynucleotide into the chromosome of the host cell) into the chromosome of the host cell. Insertion of the polynucleotide into the chromosome may be accomplished by methods known in the art (e.g., homologous recombination).  
 Then, modification of the expression control sequences for increasing expression of the polynucleotide may be performed by: inducing mutations in the nucleic acid sequence by deletions, insertions, non-conservative or conservative substitutions, or combinations thereof, to further enhance the activity of the expression control sequence; or by replacing the expression control sequence with a nucleic acid sequence having a stronger activity, but the modification method of the expression control sequence is not particularly limited thereto. The expression control sequence may include a promoter, an operator sequence, a sequence encoding a ribosome binding site, a sequence for controlling termination of transcription and translation, and the like, but the expression control sequence is not particularly limited thereto. 
 The original promoter may be replaced, and a strong promoter may be ligated to an upstream region of an expression unit of the polynucleotide, but is not limited thereto. Examples of strong promoters known in the art may include cj1 to cj7 promoters (Korean patent No. 10-0620092), lac promoter, trp promoter, trc promoter, tac promoter, lambda phage PR promoter, P  L  Promoters, tet promoters, gapA promoters, SPL7 promoters, SPL13 (sm 3) promoters (Korean patent No. 10-1783170), O2 promoters (Korean patent No. 10-1632642), tkt promoters, yccA promoters, etc., but strong promoters are not limited thereto.  
 Further, modification of the polynucleotide sequence on the chromosome may be performed by: inducing mutations in the expression control sequences by deletions, insertions, non-conservative or conservative substitutions, or combinations thereof, to further enhance the activity of the polynucleotide sequences; or by replacing the polynucleotide sequence with an improved polynucleotide sequence to have a stronger activity, but the modification method of the polynucleotide sequence is not particularly limited thereto. 
 The introduction and enhancement of the activity of a protein as described above may generally increase the activity or concentration of the corresponding protein by at least 1%, at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 100%, at least 150%, at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, or at least 500%, and up to 1000% or 2000%, based on the activity or concentration of the protein in the wild-type or unmodified microbial strain, although the scope of the increase is not limited thereto. 
 Another aspect of the disclosure provides polynucleotides encoding the above protein variants. 
 As used herein, the term "polynucleotide" refers to DNA or RNA strands of more than a certain length as a polymer of nucleotides, which are long chains of nucleotide monomers linked by covalent bonds, and more specifically, refers to polynucleotide fragments encoding protein variants.  
 Polynucleotides encoding protein variants of the present disclosure may include, without limitation, any polynucleotide sequence so long as the polynucleotide sequence encodes a protein variant having L-tryptophan export ability. 
 In the present disclosure, the gene encoding the amino acid sequence of the protein having L-tryptophan export ability may be wex gene, may be derived from rhizosphere grass spiral bacteria, specifically, may be a nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, and more specifically, may be a nucleotide sequence including the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2, but the gene is not limited thereto. 
 In view of the degeneracy of the codons and the codons preferred in the biological organism in which the polypeptide is to be expressed, various modifications may be made in the coding region of the polynucleotide encoding a protein variant of the present disclosure within the scope of not altering the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. In particular, any polynucleotide sequence encoding a protein variant in which at least one amino acid selected from amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted with a different amino acid may be included without limitation. For example, the polynucleotide of the present disclosure may be a protein variant of the present disclosure, and in particular, may be a polynucleotide sequence encoding a protein including the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs 131 to 147, or a polypeptide having homology or identity to the protein, but the polynucleotide of the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and more particularly, may be a polynucleotide including any one of the polynucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs 80, 81, 82, 89, 90, 91, 92, 101, 102, 103, 110, 111, 112, 113, 122, 123, and 124, but the polynucleotide of the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Homology and identity are the same as described above.  
 In addition, any sequence encoding a protein variant in which at least one amino acid selected from amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 is substituted with a different amino acid by hybridization with any probe that can be prepared from a known gene sequence (e.g., a sequence complementary to all or part of the above polynucleotide sequence) under stringent conditions may be included without limitation. 
 The term "stringent conditions" refers to conditions that enable specific hybridization between polynucleotides. These conditions are specifically described in the literature (e.g., J Sambrook et al, supra). For example, the conditions may include hybridization between genes having high homology (homology is 40% or more, specifically 90% or more, more specifically 95% or more, even more specifically 97% or more, and most specifically 99% or more), while hybridization is not performed between genes having homology lower than the above; or under conventional washing conditions of southern hybridization, i.e., at a salt concentration and temperature corresponding to 60 â, 1 XSSC, and 0.1% SDS, specifically 60 â, 0.1 XSSC, and 0.1% SDS, and more specifically 68 â, 0.1 XSSC, and 0.1% SDS, once, specifically two or three times. However, the hybridization conditions are not limited thereto, but may be appropriately adjusted according to the purpose by those skilled in the art.  
 Although mismatches between bases are possible depending on the stringency of hybridization, hybridization requires that two nucleotides comprise complementary sequences. The term "complementary" is used to describe the relationship between nucleotide bases capable of hybridizing to each other. For example, with respect to DNA, adenosine is complementary to thymine, and cytosine is complementary to guanine. Thus, the disclosure may include isolated polynucleotide fragments that are complementary to the entire sequence, as well as substantially similar polynucleotide sequences. 
 In particular, T can be at 55 DEG C  m  Under these conditions, polynucleotides having homology are detected using hybridization conditions (which include a hybridization step) and using the above conditions. In addition, T  m  The value may be 60 â, 63 â, or 65 â, but the temperature is not limited thereto, and may be appropriately adjusted according to the purpose by those skilled in the art. 
 The degree of stringency suitable for hybridization of polynucleotides depends on the length and degree of complementarity of the polynucleotides, and variables are well known in the art (see Sambrook et al, supra, 9.50 to 9.51 and 11.7 to 11.8). 
 Yet another aspect of the disclosure provides a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a protein variant. 
 As used herein, the term "vector" refers to a DNA construct comprising a nucleotide sequence of a polynucleotide encoding a target protein operably linked to suitable control sequences such that the target protein can be expressed in a suitable host. Control sequences include promoters capable of initiating transcription, any operator sequences for controlling transcription, sequences encoding suitable mRNA ribosome binding sites, and sequences which control transcription and translation termination. After transformation into a suitable host cell, the vector may replicate or function independently of the host genome, or may be integrated into the host genome itself.  
 The carrier used in the present disclosure is not particularly limited, and any carrier known in the art may be used. Examples of conventionally used vectors may include natural or recombinant plasmids, cosmids, viruses, and phages. For example, we15, M13, MBL3, MBL4, IXII, ASHII, APII, t, t11, charon4A, charon a, etc. can be used as phage vectors or cosmid vectors; and a vector based on pBR, pUC, pBluescriptII, pGEM, pTZ, pCL, pET or the like may be used as the plasmid vector. Specifically, vectors such as pDZ, pACYC177, pACYC184, pCL, pECCG117, pUC19, pBR322, pMW118, pCC1BAC and the like can be used. 
 For example, a polynucleotide encoding a target protein in a chromosome can be replaced with a mutated polynucleotide by a vector for intracellular chromosomal insertion. Insertion of the polynucleotide into the chromosome may be performed using any method known in the art (e.g., homologous recombination), but the method is not limited thereto. The vector may further comprise a selectable marker for confirming its successful insertion into the chromosome. The selectable marker is used to select cells transformed with the vector, i.e., to confirm whether the target nucleic acid molecule has been successfully inserted, and markers that provide a selectable phenotype (e.g., drug resistance, co-nutrition, resistance to cytotoxic agents, expression of surface proteins, etc.) can be used. In the case of treatment with a selection agent, only cells capable of expressing the selection marker are able to survive or express other phenotypic traits, allowing for easy selection of transformed cells.  
 It is another object of the present disclosure to provide microorganisms producing L-tryptophan which express protein variants having L-tryptophan export activity. 
 As used herein, the term "L-tryptophan-producing microorganism" refers to a microorganism that is capable of overproducing L-tryptophan from a carbon source in a medium as compared to a wild-type or unmodified strain of the microorganism. In addition, the microorganism producing L-tryptophan may be a recombinant microorganism. Specifically, the microorganism may be a microorganism of the genus Enterobacter (genus Enterobacter), a microorganism of the genus Escherichia (genus Escherichia), a microorganism of the genus Erwinia, a microorganism of the genus Serratia, a microorganism of the genus providencia (genus Providencia), a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium, or a microorganism of the genus Brevibacterium (genus Brevibacterium), but the type of microorganism is not particularly limited as long as the microorganism can produce L-tryptophan. More specifically, the microorganism may be a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium or a microorganism of the genus Escherichia. 
 Even more specifically, the microorganism of the genus Escherichia may be Escherichia coli, and the microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium may be Corynebacterium glutamicum, but may include, without limitation, any microorganism of the genus Escherichia or Corynebacterium into which a protein having L-tryptophan export activity is introduced or activity is enhanced and thus L-tryptophan production can be increased.  
 In the above microorganism, the L-tryptophan production amount can be increased using a method of increasing L-tryptophan biosynthesis by enhancing expression of the tktA gene or by blocking a branch pathway in the L-tryptophan biosynthesis pathway to continuously supply a precursor (e.g., erythrose-4-phosphate; E4P) and efficient energy utilization, or using a method of utilizing a smaller amount of ATP, or the like. 
 Specifically, in the present disclosure, as long as the parent strain is an L-tryptophan-producing microorganism, the L-tryptophan-producing microorganism (which expresses a protein or protein variant having an L-tryptophan output activity, or which is modified so that a protein or protein variant having an L-tryptophan output activity can be expressed) parent strain is not particularly limited. The microorganism producing L-tryptophan may be a microorganism in which the activity of a gene in a competing pathway, a regulator in a targeting pathway of an L-tryptophan operator, a gene for inputting L-tryptophan, or a gene for inputting and decomposing L-tryptophan is impaired or inactivated to enhance the L-tryptophan biosynthetic pathway; and/or may be a microorganism in which the L-tryptophan operon activity is overexpressed. Specifically, the activity of trpR (i.e., a gene of an enzyme group for regulating tryptophan synthesis, which can inhibit the expression of an L-tryptophan biosynthesis gene (trpecba)), or the activity of Mtr (i.e., a membrane protein that inputs extracellular L-tryptophan into a cell) may be impaired or removed, as compared to its endogenous activity.  
 To achieve the above object, another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for producing tryptophan, which comprises culturing an L-tryptophan-producing microorganism expressing a protein variant in a medium. 
 L-tryptophan, a protein having L-tryptophan export activity and comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, the expression of the protein and the microorganism are the same as described above. 
 As used herein, the term "culturing" means growing a microorganism under appropriately controlled environmental conditions. The culture process of the present disclosure may be performed under suitable media and culture conditions known in the art. Depending on the strain to be selected, the person skilled in the art can easily adjust this culture process for use. Specifically, the culturing process may be performed in batch culture, continuous culture, and fed-batch culture known in the art, but the culturing process is not limited thereto. 
 As used herein, the term "medium" refers to a mixture of substances containing as a main component nutrients required for culturing microorganisms, and which provides nutrients, growth factors, etc., as well as water critical to survival and growth. Specifically, as the medium and other culture conditions used for culturing the microorganism of the present disclosure, any medium used for conventional culture of microorganisms may be used without particular limitation. However, the microorganisms of the present disclosure may be cultured under aerobic conditions in a conventional medium containing an appropriate carbon source, nitrogen source, phosphorus source, inorganic compound, amino acid, vitamin, and/or the like while adjusting temperature, pH, and the like.  
 In the present disclosure, the carbon source may include carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, etc.); sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol, sorbitol, etc.); organic acids (e.g., pyruvic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, etc.); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid, methionine, lysine, etc.), and the like. In addition, the carbon source may include natural organic nutrients (e.g., starch hydrolysates, molasses, brown sugar molasses, rice bran, tapioca, cane molasses, corn steep liquor, etc.). In particular, carbohydrates such as glucose and sterilized pre-treated molasses (i.e., molasses is converted to reducing sugar) may be used, and in addition, various other carbon sources may be used in an appropriate amount without limitation. These carbon sources may be used alone or in combination of two or more, but the carbon sources are not limited thereto. 
 Examples of the nitrogen source may include inorganic nitrogen sources (e.g., ammonia, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium nitrate, etc.); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid, methionine, glutamine, etc.); and organic nitrogen sources (e.g., peptone, N-Z amine, meat extract, yeast extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, casein hydrolysate, fish or its decomposition products, defatted soybean cake or its decomposition products, etc.). These nitrogen sources may be used alone or in combination of two or more, but the nitrogen sources are not limited thereto.  
 Examples of the phosphorus source may include potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, the corresponding sodium-containing salts, and the like. Examples of the inorganic compound may include sodium chloride, calcium chloride, ferric chloride, magnesium sulfate, ferric sulfate, manganese sulfate, calcium carbonate, and the like. In addition, amino acids, vitamins and/or suitable precursors may be included, among others. These constituent components or precursors may be added to a medium for batch culture or continuous culture, but are not limited thereto. 
 In the present disclosure, the pH of the medium may be adjusted during the cultivation of the microorganism by adding a compound (e.g., ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, etc.) to the medium in an appropriate manner. In addition, during the culture, an antifoaming agent (e.g., fatty acid polyglycol ester) may be added to prevent foam generation. In addition, oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas may be injected into the medium to maintain an aerobic state of the medium; alternatively, the anaerobic or microaerophilic state of the medium may be maintained without injecting gas or injecting nitrogen, hydrogen or carbon dioxide gas into the medium, but the gas is not limited thereto. 
 The medium temperature may be in the range from 20 â to 50 â, and specifically in the range from 30 â to 37 â, but the medium temperature is not limited thereto. The cultivation may be continued until a desired amount of the useful substance is obtained, and specifically, for 10 to 100 hours, but the cultivation period is not limited thereto.  
 The production process may include recovering L-tryptophan from the cultured medium or microorganism. 
 In the step of recovering tryptophan, the desired L-tryptophan may be recovered from the medium using the methods for culturing microorganisms of the present disclosure (e.g., according to a batch, continuous, or fed-batch culture process, using suitable methods known in the art). For example, methods such as centrifugation, filtration, treatment with a protein crystallization precipitant (salting-out method), extraction, ultrasonication, ultrafiltration, dialysis, various chromatographies (e.g., molecular sieve chromatography (gel filtration), adsorption chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, etc.), and HPLC may be used alone or in combination, but the method is not limited thereto. 
 The production process may include a purification process. During the purification process, the recovered L-tryptophan may be purified using suitable purification methods known in the art. 
 Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method of increasing the L-tryptophan output ability of a microorganism, comprising modifying the microorganism such that a protein variant having L-tryptophan output activity, wherein at least one amino acid selected from amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 1 is replaced with a different amino acid, can be expressed in the microorganism.  
 Yet another aspect of the disclosure provides the use of a protein variant for increasing the output capacity of L-tryptophan. 
 Yet another aspect of the present disclosure provides the use of a protein variant for increasing the capacity of L-tryptophan production. 
 Since the protein variants of the present disclosure may increase L-tryptophan export ability of a microorganism, they may be useful for increasing L-tryptophan production. Protein variants and other amino acids are the same as described above.

 Example 7: measurement of MIC in Corynebacterium microorganism Strain into which genes derived from various microorganisms were introduced 
 
 To confirm the presence of tryptophan export activity in the 5 types of Corynebacterium glutamicum strains prepared in examples 2 to 6 (i.e., ATCC13869:: pgapA-Hrh, ATCC13869:: pgapA-Pst, ATCC 13869::: pgapA-afa, ATCC 13869::: pgapA-Cne and ATCC 13869::: pgapA-Eco), minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) experiments were performed using tryptophan analogues and phenylalanine analogues (i.e., another aromatic amino acid). 5 different strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum, each of which has the gene encoding a membrane protein introduced, were cultured in minimal liquid medium at 30âfor 24 hours, diluted to 3X 10, respectively   3  Individual cells and 3X 10  4  Concentration of individual cells, and then spotting culture is performed in a substantially solid medium to which tryptophan analogues and phenylalanine analogues are added. 
 For Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) experiments, p-fluoro-DL-phenylalanine (2.5 mg/mL) or 5-fluoro-DL-tryptophan (0.25 Î¼g/mL) was added to minimum solid medium and cell growth was observed after 60 hours (Table 2). 
 The introduction of the selected 5 types of genes all enabled cell growth under conditions in which phenylalanine analog was added at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Among them, the introduction of genes derived from rhizosphere grass spiral, alcaligenes faecalis and E.coli showed the highest cell growth. The introduction of the gene derived from Pseudomonas stutzeri showed a slight decrease in cell growth, and the introduction of the gene derived from copper greedy was the lowest cell growth, compared to the above three strains. The wild type ATCC13869 strain did not grow under the same conditions. In addition, under the condition that tryptophan analogues are added at a concentration of 0.25. Mu.g/mL, the cell can be grown by introducing only the gene derived from rhizosphere of the helicobacter sp. 
 From the above results, it was observed that even if there is a difference in activity between the introductions, the introductions of the selected 5 types of genes all showed resistance to phenylalanine and phenylalanine analogs. In contrast, with respect to tryptophan and tryptophan analogues, the introduction of only the gene derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter has been shown to be specific and excellent in resistance thereto. Based on these results, it can be explained that only the membrane protein encoded by the gene derived from rhizosphere grass spiral can be used as the output protein for tryptophan.

 Example 9: measurement of MIC of E.coli in which genes derived from membrane proteins of various microorganisms were overexpressed 
 
 To confirm the resistance of E.coli strains in which the 5 types of genes prepared in example 8 were overexpressed (i.e., W3110/pCL1920-PyccA-Hrh, W3110/pCL1920-PyccA-Pst, W3110/pCL1920-PyccA-Afa, W3110/pCL1920-PyccA-Cne, and W3110/pCL 1920-PyccA-Eco), minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) experiments were performed using tryptophan analogues and phenylalanine analogues. Coli strains in which 5 types of genes were overexpressed were cultured in M9 minimal liquid medium containing spectinomycin (50. Mu.g/mL) at 37âfor 15 hours, diluted to 10 respectively   4  Individual cells and 10  5  Concentration of individual cells, and then spot-like culture in M9 glucose minimal solid medium containing spectinomycin (50. Mu.g/mL) to which tryptophan analog or phenylalanine analog was added. For Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) experiments, p-fluoro-DL-phenylalanine (2 mg/mL) or 5-fluoro-DL-tryptophan (0.7. Mu.g/mL) was added to M9 minimal solid medium, and cell growth was observed after 48 hours (Table 3). 
 As in the corynebacterium glutamicum strain, when the gene derived from escherichia coli is overexpressed, the escherichia coli strain shows excellent growth with the addition of the phenylalanine analog, and overexpression of the gene derived from alcaligenes faecalis also shows significant growth. However, overexpression of genes derived from rhizosphere, pseudomonas stutzeri, and copper greedy, did not show comparable growth in W3110/pCL1920 (i.e., control). In contrast, overexpression of all 5 types of selected genes made it possible to grow all cells with the addition of tryptophan analogues. Among them, overexpression of genes derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter showed the highest growth, and overexpression of output genes derived from alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli showed the second highest growth. Overexpression of the export genes from Pseudomonas stutzeri and copper greedy hook showed negligible growth.  
 MIC experimental results for the 5 types of genes in the e.coli strain were similar to those observed in c. Genes derived from rhizosphere grass spiral bacteria show specificity and excellent resistance to tryptophan and analogues thereof in both Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli strains, and export genes derived from Escherichia coli show higher export resistance to phenylalanine and analogues thereof than to tryptophan. From these results, it was determined that genes derived from rhizosphere helicobacter showed specificity and excellent export ability for tryptophan in corynebacterium glutamicum and escherichia coli strains.

 Reference example 1: preparation of L-tryptophan-producing microorganism of Corynebacterium glutamicum 
 
 The strain producing L-tryptophan was developed from the wild-type Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13869. Since wild-type Corynebacterium glutamicum cannot produce L-tryptophan or can produce only very small amounts, if possible, attempts have been made to use strains in which the biosynthetic pathway necessary for the production of L-tryptophan is enhanced as parent strains. Specifically, the expression of the operator of the L-tryptophan biosynthesis gene is increased by enhancing the promoter. In addition, to release feedback inhibition of the TrpE protein, the 38 th amino acid of TrpE (i.e., serine) was replaced with arginine (Journal of Bacteriology, nov.1987, p.5330-5332).  
 For the above genetic manipulation, first, an upstream region of the trpE promoter and a downstream region of the 38 th amino acid mutation of the trpE were obtained for homologous recombination in chromosome. Specifically, a genetic fragment of the region upstream of the trpE promoter was obtained by performing PCR using the chromosomal DNA of Corynebacterium glutamicum as a template and the primers of SEQ ID NO:45 and SEQ ID NO:46, whereas a genetic fragment of the region downstream of the 38 th amino acid mutation of TrpE was obtained by performing PCR using the chromosomal DNA of Corynebacterium glutamicum as a template and the primers of SEQ ID NO:47 and SEQ ID NO: 48.

 Example 10: by microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium into which genes derived from rhizosphere of the genus helicobacter and Escherichia coli are introduced 
 Tryptophan production 
 
 A gene derived from rhizosphere spiral is introduced into CA04-8352, which shows excellent activity at the minimum inhibitory concentration of the tryptophan analog in example 7, and CA04-8352 is the tryptophan-producing strain prepared in reference example 1. For this purpose, the pDZTn-PgapA-Hrh vector for introducing the gene derived from rhizosphere spiral prepared in example 2 was transformed into CA04-8352 (i.e., tryptophan-producing strain) by electroporation and subjected to the procedure as in example 2, and thus a strain in which one copy of the gene derived from rhizosphere spiral was inserted between transposon genes was obtained. The resulting strain was designated CA04-8405. 
 In addition, a gene derived from E.coli was introduced into CA04-8352 (i.e., tryptophan-producing strain) as a control group. The pDZTn-PgapA-Eco vector for introducing the gene derived from E.coli prepared in example 6 was transformed into CA04-8352 (i.e., tryptophan-producing strain) by electroporation and the procedure as in example 6 was performed, and thus a strain in which one copy of the gene derived from E.coli was inserted between transposon genes was obtained. The resulting strain was designated CA04-8406. 
 Strains CA04-8405 and CA04-8406 obtained by the above procedure were cultured by the following methods to confirm tryptophan production relative to the CA04-8352 strain as a control group prepared in reference example 1. Each strain was inoculated into a 250mL corner-baffle flask (burner-buffer flask) containing seed medium (25 mL) and cultured with shaking at 200rpm at 30âfor 20 hours. Then, each seed culture solution (1 mL) was inoculated into a 250mL corner-baffle flask containing a production medium (25 mL) and cultured at 30âwith shaking at 200rpm for 24 hours. After the completion of the culture, the L-tryptophan production was measured by HPLC.

 The results of L-tryptophan production in the medium by the CA04-8352, CA04-8405 and CA04-8406 strains are shown in Table 4 above. The CA04-8405 strain into which the gene derived from rhizosphere of the genus Zosterae was introduced produced L-tryptophan at a final concentration of 1.52g/L in flask culture, and this was about 5-fold improvement over the CA04-8352 strain (i.e., control). This suggests that genes derived from rhizosphere grass spirochete can significantly increase L-tryptophan production in corynebacterium glutamicum strains. In contrast, the strain CA04-8406 introduced with the E.coli gene produced L-tryptophan at a concentration of 0.23g/L, which was almost the same as the L-tryptophan production of the strain CA04-8352 (i.e., the parent strain of the strain CA 04-8406). As confirmed in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) experiments of tryptophan analogues and phenylalanine analogues confirmed in examples 7 and 9, the gene derived from escherichia coli was considered to be an output gene showing a higher specificity for phenylalanine than for tryptophan. The CA04-8405 strain was internationally deposited with the International depository organization for Korea microorganisms (KCCM) at 21/2017 under the provisions of the Budapest treaty, and assigned accession number KCCM12099P (CA 04-8405).  
 
 Example 11: analysis in Corynebacterium glutamicum into which genes derived from rhizosphere helicobacter were introducedIntracellular tryptamine 
 Acid metabolites 
 
 To clearly confirm whether the intracellular tryptophan concentration decreased with an increase in tryptophan output of the CA04-8405 strain (i.e., the tryptophan-producing strain), the intracellular tryptophan concentrations in the CA04-8405 strain and the CA04-8352 strain (i.e., the parent strain of the CA04-8405 strain) were measured by an extraction method using an organic solvent. 
 Methods for analyzing intracellular metabolites were performed according to the methods described in the references (Nakamura J et al, appl. Environ. Microbiol.73 (14): 4491-4498, 2007). 
 First, with respect to the mutant Corynebacterium glutamicum strains CA04-8352 and CA04-8405, each strain was inoculated into a 250mL corner-baffle flask containing a seed medium (25 mL) and cultured with shaking at 200rpm at 30âfor 20 hours. Then, each seed culture solution (1 mL) was inoculated into a 250mL corner-baffle flask containing a production medium (25 mL) and cultured with shaking at 200rpm at 30 â. Intracellular tryptophan concentrations were analyzed three times based on glucose consumption. The cultured cells in each step were separated from the broth by rapid vacuum filtration (Durapore HV,0.45 Î¼m; millipore, billerica, mass.). The filter with cells adsorbed was washed twice with distilled water (10 mL) and immersed in methanol containing 5 Î¼m morpholinoethanesulfonic acid and 5 Î¼m methionine sulfone for 10 minutes. Chloroform (1.6 mL) and distilled water (0.64 Î¼l) were added to the cell extract (1.6 mL) obtained above and mixed well, and only the aqueous phase was applied to a spin column to remove protein impurities. The filtered extracts were analyzed using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry and the results are shown in figure 1. 
 As shown in FIG. 1, it was confirmed that the CA04-8405 strain showed a decrease in intracellular tryptophan concentration to a level of 33% to 41% as compared with the parent strain CA04-8352 thereof. These results indicate that tryptophan produced in cells of the Corynebacterium glutamicum strain was smoothly exported out of the cells due to the expression of genes derived from the rhizosphere helicobacter, and thus the intracellular tryptophan concentration of the CA04-8405 strain was reduced. From these results, it was confirmed that the gene derived from rhizosphere rhodospirillum was a gene encoding a membrane protein having tryptophan-specific export ability. 
 
 Reference example 2: preparation of L-tryptophan-producing microorganism of the genus Escherichia 
 
 L-tryptophan-producing microorganisms of the genus Escherichia were developed from wild-type E.coli W3110. To confirm whether tryptophan production is significantly increased with the modification of a protein having L-tryptophan output activity for expression, a strain prepared to produce L-tryptophan was used as a parent strain. Specifically, expression of the L-tryptophan biosynthesis gene (trpEDBA), which is involved in the production of L-tryptophan from Chorismate (chord), was inhibited by TrpR. Thus, trpR gene encoding trpR was removed. In addition, in order to release feedback inhibition of the TrpE polypeptide according to the increase in L-tryptophan production, the 21 st amino acid (i.e., proline) from the N-terminus of TrpE was substituted with serine (J.biochem. Mol. Biol.32,20-24 (1999)).  
 The Mtr membrane protein has an effect of introducing extracellular L-tryptophan into cells, and the TnaA protein has a function of decomposing intracellular L-tryptophan and water molecules into indole, pyruvic acid and ammonia (NH)  3  ) Is effective in (1). Thus, mtr and tnaA genes that inhibit L-tryptophan production and decompose L-tryptophan were removed. 
 To remove these genes, lambda-red recombination methods were used (one-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in E.coli K-12 using PCR products, datsenko KA, wanner BL., proc Natl Acad Sci USA.2000Jun 6;97 (12): 6640-6645). To remove the mtr gene, PCR was performed using the pKD4 vector as a template and primers of SEQ ID NO. 64 and SEQ ID NO. 65. As a result, a 1580bp gene fragment was obtained in which the FRT-kanamycin-FRT cassette was bound to a pair of 50bp homologous nucleotides flanking the mtr gene (in which chromosomal homologous recombination occurred therebetween). Kanamycin antibiotic marker of pKD4 vector was used to confirm removal of target gene and insertion of antibiotic gene, and FRT region had the effect of removing antibiotic marker after removal of target gene.

When OD is  600  When about 0.1 was reached, it was confirmed that the expression of the recombinase was induced by the E.coli W3110 strain transformed with the pKD46 vector by adding 10mM L-arabinose. When OD is  600  When about 0.6 was reached, the strain was prepared as competent cells, and the linear gene fragment obtained in the above procedure was transformed by electroporation, in which the FRT-kanamycin-FRT cassette was bound to a pair of 50bp homologous nucleotides flanking the mtr gene. For colonies grown on LB solid medium containing kanamycin (25 mg/L), colony PCR was performed using the primers of SEQ ID NO:66 and SEQ ID NO:67, and colonies in which a 782bp gene fragment was produced were selected.

 Strains from which the mtr gene was removed due to the occurrence of homologous recombination were prepared as competent cells to remove kanamycin antibiotic markers, and then transformed with pCP20 vector by electroporation. The pCP20 vector expresses FLP protein and thereby recognizes and binds to FRT sites flanking kanamycin antibiotics in the chromosome, thereby removing antibiotic markers between FRT sites. The pCP20 vector-transformed strain grown in LB solid medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/L) and chloramphenicol (25 mg/L) was cultured in LB liquid medium at 30âfor 1 hour, further at 42âfor 15 hours, and spread on LB solid medium.

The transformant selected was a strain in which the pSG76-C-trpE (P21S) plasmid was inserted into the trpE region of the genome by first insertion. The strain (Journal of Bacteriology, july 1997, p.4426-4428) into which the trpE (P21S) gene obtained was inserted was transformed with pAscep plasmid which expresses restriction enzyme I-SceI that cleaves the I-SceI region present in pSG76-C plasmid, and strains grown in LB-Ap (yeast extract 10g/L, naCl g/L, tryptone 10g/L, and ampicillin 100.

The trpE gene in the selected strain was amplified using the primers of SEQ ID NO. 74 and SEQ ID NO. 75, and it was confirmed by sequencing that the amplified trpE gene was replaced with the trpE (P21S) gene. The strain thus prepared was designated CA04-4303. 
 
 Example 12: l-tryptophan production by microorganisms of the genus Escherichia into which genes derived from rhizosphere of the genus helicobacter are introduced  
 
 The pCL1920-PyccA-Hrh prepared in example 8 was introduced into the CA04-4303 strain prepared in referential example 2, and thereby a CA04-4306 strain in which a gene derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter was overexpressed was prepared. In addition, pCL1920 vector as a control group was transformed into CA04-4303 strain. To confirm L-tryptophan production in both strains (i.e., CA04-4303/pCL1920 and CA 04-4306), these strains were cultured in LB liquid medium containing spectinomycin (50 mg/L) for 12 hours. These strains were then each inoculated into a 250mL corner-baffle flask containing 25mL of production medium, such that the initial OD  600  The value became 0.01, and then cultured with shaking at 200rpm at 37âfor 48 hours. After the completion of the culture, the L-tryptophan production was measured by HPLC. 
 The results for L-tryptophan production in the CA04-4303/pCL1920 and CA04-4306 strains in the medium are shown in Table 5 below. Strain CA04-4306, into which a gene derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter was introduced and overexpressed, showed a final L-tryptophan concentration of 2.1g/L in flask culture, which was about 50% higher than that of the control group. This suggests that genes derived from rhizosphere grass spirochete can also export L-tryptophan in e.coli and thereby significantly increase its L-tryptophan production.

 Thus, it can be seen from the results of examples 7 and 9 that the gene derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter shows high specificity and excellent resistance to L-tryptophan and analogues thereof. From the results of examples 10 and 12, it can be seen that the genes derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter increased L-tryptophan production in both Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli strains. In addition, it was observed in example 11 that genes derived from rhizosphere of helicobacter output tryptophan substantially extracellularly. As a result, the gene derived from rhizosphere of the genus Sphaeromyces was designated as wex (tryptophan [ (] W ) Output of Genes). 
 
 Example 13: wex export ability improvement using random mutagenesis 
 
 In this example, error-prone PCR was performed to apply random mutagenesis to the wild-type wex gene, and a diversified PCR random mutagenesis kit (Diversify PCR Random Mutagenesis Kit) (Clontech, USA) was used in performing error-prone PCR.  
 To obtain variants of the wex gene introduced with random mutagenesis, error-prone PCR was performed using pCL1920-PyccA-wex prepared in example 8 as a template, SEQ ID NO:78 and SEQ ID NO: 79.

 Using the products of error-prone PCR (which was performed under the conditions of tables 6 and 7) and pCL1920 (which was cleaved with SmaI restriction enzyme), a library of recombinant mutant plasmids was obtained by the Gibson assembly method (DG Gibson et al, nature Methods, VOL.6No.5, MAY 2009,NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix). The mutant library, pCL1920-PyccA-Hrh and pCL1920 obtained by the above methods were transformed into E.coli W3110 cells, cultured in LB plate medium containing spectinomycin (50 g/L), and 50 colonies were screened from the mutant library. Sequencing was performed to determine their mutation rate and the presence/absence of mutations at various positions. As a result of sequencing, the mutation rate of the case #1 condition was 1.3kb-1, and the mutation rate of the case #2 condition was 2.5kb-1. Both cases #1 and #2 were determined to meet mutation rates suitable for obtaining a library of mutants, and a process of screening for effective mutations was performed using the library prepared under the above conditions.  
 300. Mu.L of M9 minimal medium containing 50. Mu.g/mL of 5' -fluorotryptophan (i.e., L-tryptophan analog) was aliquoted into each well of a 96-deep well plate, followed by inoculation of each colony of the previously transformed mutant library (i.e., W3110/pCL1920-PyccA-Hrh, W3110/pCL1920, and W3110/pCL1920-PyccA-wex mutant library). The incubation was carried out at 1200rpm/37âand after 16 hours the OD was measured at 600 nm. As in the case of the control strains (W3110/pCL 1920 and W3110/pCL 1920-PyccA-Hrh), almost no growth of the majority of mutant libraries was observed in the deep-well plates. Among them, 51 colonies with improved growth were selected, and pCL1920-PyccA-wex mutant plasmids were extracted from the colonies, respectively, and reconverted into E.coli W3110 strain to evaluate reproducibility. In M9 minimal medium, which typically contains 5' -fluorotryptophan at a concentration of 50. Mu.g/mL, 10 strains showing improved specific growth in M9 minimal medium were observed and their OD was recorded.

 After the pCL 1920-pyvca-wex mutant plasmids were extracted from the 10 selected mutant strains, sequencing was performed to confirm their mutation, and as a result, it was confirmed that the mutation occurred in the coding sequence (CDS), which is not in the promoter region. In addition, it was confirmed that mutation sites in 8 of 10 mutants were concentrated in the region from 79 th amino acid (i.e., leucine) to 83 th amino acid (i.e., isoleucine) of the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein, and that most of the mutations were substituted with hydrophobic amino acids, aliphatic amino acids, or relatively small L-amino acids. Thus, it was determined that positions 79 to 83 of the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein could be the core region into which mutations were introduced to increase L-tryptophan export ability. In this regard, attempts have been made to increase the activity of various hydrophobic amino acid(s), aliphatic amino acid(s), or relatively small L-amino acid(s) by substituting the amino acid(s) in the corresponding sequence.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using pDZTn-PgapA-Hrh prepared in example 2 as a template to produce mutations of three different amino acids other than leucine.

 The pDZTn-PgapA-well L79A, pDZTn-PgapA-well L79V and the pDZTn-PgapA-well L79I vectors prepared as shown in Table 11 were each transformed into the CA04-8352 strain prepared in referential example 1 by electroporation, and then subjected to secondary crossover to obtain three strains in which the mutant wex gene was inserted into the chromosome, respectively. Corresponding genetic manipulations were confirmed by genomic sequencing and PCR methods using primers of SEQ ID NO. 7 and SEQ ID NO. 8, each of which can amplify the outer region of the homologous recombination upstream region and downstream region inserted into the corresponding gene, respectively. 
 The obtained mutants were named CA04-8352 (wex L79A), CA04-8352 (wex L79V) and CA04-8352 (wex L79I), respectively. 
 To confirm tryptophan production in the CA04-8352, CA04-8405, CA04-8352 (wex L79A), CA04-8352 (wex L79V) and CA04-8352 (wex L79I) strains, these strains were cultured by the same method as in example 10.

 As shown in the results of table 12, all of the three mutants in which leucine at position 79 of the Wex amino acid sequence was replaced with different hydrophobic amino acids showed an improvement in fermentation yield of 1.59% p to 2.95% p, compared to the CA04-8405 strain into which wild-type Wex was introduced. In particular, the Wex L79A mutant showed the greatest increase in L-tryptophan fermentation yield, and these results indicate that substitution of leucine at position 79 of the Wex amino acid sequence with a different hydrophobic amino acid can significantly increase the activity of the L-tryptophan output ability of Wex. 
 
 Example 15: 80 th amino acid (serine) of Wex sequence in microorganism of Corynebacterium genus is hydrophobic amino acid 
 Substitution of 
 
 Attempts were made to confirm the efficacy of outputting L-tryptophan by substituting the 80 th amino acid serine (hereinafter referred to as serine at 80 th position) in the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein with a hydrophobic amino acid. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the same method as in example 14 using pDZTn-PgapA-wex as a template to generate mutations that are four different types of hydrophobic amino acids.  
 In addition, serine at position 80 of the Wex amino acid sequence was replaced with each of different hydrophobic amino acids (i.e., alanine (A) (SEQ ID NO:89, SEQ ID NO: 134), valine (V) (SEQ ID NO:90, SEQ ID NO: 135), leucine (L) (SEQ ID NO:91, SEQ ID NO: 136) and isoleucine (I) (SEQ ID NO:92, SEQ ID NO: 137)) using the same method as in example 14. The mutagenesis primer set and the mutant form used to obtain the pDZTn-PgapA-wex mutant plasmid were the same as those shown in Table 13 below.

 pDZTn-PgapA-well S80A, pDZTn-PgapA-well S80V, pDZTn-PgapA-well S80L and pDZTn-PgapA-well S80I vectors prepared as shown in Table 13 were each transformed into CA04-8352 strain by electroporation, and then subjected to secondary crossover to obtain four strains in which the mutant wex gene was inserted into chromosome, respectively. Corresponding genetic manipulations were confirmed by genomic sequencing and PCR methods using primers of SEQ ID NO. 7 and SEQ ID NO. 8, each of which can amplify the outer region of the homologous recombination upstream region and downstream region inserted into the corresponding gene, respectively.  
 The obtained mutants were named CA04-8352 (wex S80A), CA04-8352 (wex S80V), CA04-8352 (wex S80L), and CA04-8352 (wex S80I), respectively.

After the completion of the culture, the L-tryptophan production in each strain was measured by HPLC.

 As shown in the results of Table 14, all of the four mutants in which the amino acid at position 80 of the Wex amino acid sequence was substituted with different hydrophobic amino acids showed an improvement in fermentation yield of 1.99% p to 2.62% p, as compared with the CA04-8405 strain into which the wild-type Wex was introduced. In particular, the Wex S80V mutant shows the greatest increase in L-tryptophan fermentation yield, and these results indicate that substitution of serine at position 80 of the Wex amino acid sequence with a different hydrophobic amino acid can significantly increase the activity of the L-tryptophan output ability of Wex.

 Substitution of 
 
 Attempts were made to confirm the improved efficacy of export of L-tryptophan by substituting the 81 st amino acid leucine (hereinafter referred to as leucine at position 81) in the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein with a different hydrophobic amino acid. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the same method as in example 14 using pDZTn-PgapA-wex as a template to generate mutations that are three different types of hydrophobic amino acids other than leucine. 
 In addition, leucine at position 81 of the Wex amino acid sequence was replaced with each of the different hydrophobic amino acids (i.e., alanine (A) (SEQ ID NO:101, SEQ ID NO: 138), valine (V) (SEQ ID NO:102, SEQ ID NO: 139), and isoleucine (I) (SEQ ID NO:103, SEQ ID NO: 140)) using the same method as in example 14.

Corresponding genetic manipulations were confirmed by genomic sequencing and PCR methods using primers of SEQ ID NO. 7 and SEQ ID NO. 8, each of which can amplify the outer region of the homologous recombination upstream region and downstream region inserted into the corresponding gene, respectively. 
 The obtained mutants were named CA04-8352 (wex L81A), CA04-8352 (wex L81V) and CA04-8352 (wex L81I), respectively.

 As shown in the results of Table 16, all of the three mutants in which the amino acid at position 81 of the Wex amino acid sequence was replaced with different hydrophobic amino acids showed an improvement in fermentation yield of 2.03% p to 2.87% p, as compared with the CA04-8405 strain into which the wild-type Wex was introduced. In particular, the Wex L81A mutant showed the greatest increase in the fermentation yield of L-tryptophan, and these results indicate that substitution of leucine at position 81 of the amino acid sequence of Wex with a different hydrophobic amino acid can significantly increase the activity of the L-tryptophan output ability of Wex.

 Attempts were made to confirm the improved efficacy of export of L-tryptophan by substituting the 82 nd amino acid serine (hereinafter referred to as serine at position 82) in the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein with a hydrophobic amino acid. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using pDZTn-PgapA-wex as a template to generate mutations for four different types of hydrophobic amino acids using the same method as in example 14.

 As shown in the results of Table 18, all of the four mutants in which the amino acid at position 82 of the Wex amino acid sequence was substituted with different hydrophobic amino acids showed an improvement in fermentation yield of 1.40% p to 2.76% p, as compared with the CA04-8405 strain into which the wild-type Wex was introduced. In particular, the Wex S82A mutant showed the greatest increase in L-tryptophan fermentation yield, and these results indicate that substitution of serine at position 82 of the Wex amino acid sequence with a different hydrophobic amino acid can significantly increase the activity of the L-tryptophan output ability of Wex.

 Attempts were made to confirm the improved efficacy of export of L-tryptophan by substituting the 83 rd amino acid isoleucine (hereinafter referred to as 83 rd isoleucine) in the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein with a different hydrophobic amino acid. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the same method as in example 14 using pDZTn-PgapA-wex as a template to generate mutations that are three different types of hydrophobic amino acids other than isoleucine.

In particular, the Wex I83L mutant showed the greatest increase in L-tryptophan fermentation yield, and these results indicate that substitution of isoleucine at position 83 of the Wex amino acid sequence with a different hydrophobic amino acid can significantly increase the activity of the Wex in L-tryptophan output. From the results shown in examples 2 to 6 above, it was confirmed that substitution of amino acids 79 to 83 in the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein with different hydrophobic amino acids can significantly increase the activity of L-tryptophan export ability in Corynebacterium glutamicum strains.

 As in the coryneform microorganism, attempts have been made to confirm the improved efficacy of L-tryptophan export in the Escherichia microorganism by substituting the 79 th amino acid (i.e., leucine) in the amino acid sequence of the Wex membrane protein with a different hydrophobic amino acid.

In particular, as in the strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum producing L-tryptophan, the Escherichia coli strain having the Wex L79A mutation showed the greatest improvement in fermentation yield of L-tryptophan, and these results indicate that substitution of leucine at position 79 of the amino acid sequence of Wex with different hydrophobic amino acids can significantly increase the activity of the L-tryptophan export ability of Wex in microorganisms of the genus Escherichia as well as in microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium.

 TABLE 31 mutagenesis primer set for preparing a mutant plasmid expressed in Escherichia microorganism in which the 83 rd amino acid of the Wex amino acid sequence was mutated separately  
 
 
 
 The pCL1920-PyccA-wex I83A, pCL1920-PyccA-wex I83V and pCL1920-PyccA-wex I83L vectors prepared as shown in Table 31 were each transformed into the CA04-4303 strain by electroporation, and thereby three strains in which each of the mutant wex genes different from each other in amino acid 83 was introduced were obtained. The obtained mutants were named CA04-4303 (wex I83A), CA04-4303 (wex I83V) and CA04-4303 (wex I83L), respectively. 
 To confirm the production of tryptophan in the CA04-4303 (pCL 1920), CA04-4306, CA04-4303 (wex I83A), CA04-4303 (wex I83V) and CA04-4303 (wex I83L) strains, these strains were cultured in the same manner as in example 12. After the completion of the culture, the L-tryptophan production in each strain was measured by HPLC. 
 TABLE 32 confirmation of L-tryptophan production in L-tryptophan-producing Strain derived from E.coli (CA 04-4303 (pCL 1920)), strain in which L-tryptophan output gene (Wex) was expressed (CA 04-4306), and mutant in which amino acid at position 83 of the Wex amino acid sequence was mutated separately (CA 04-4303 (Wex I83A), CA04-4303 (Wex I83V) and CA04-4303 (Wex I83L)) 
 
 
 
 As shown in the results of Table 32, all of the three mutants in which the 83 rd amino acid of the Wex amino acid sequence was replaced with different hydrophobic amino acids showed an improvement in fermentation yield of 0.2% p to 0.7% p, as compared with the CA04-4306 strain into which the wild-type Wex was introduced. In particular, as in the strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum producing L-tryptophan, the E.coli strain having the Wex I83L mutation also shows the greatest improvement in fermentation yield of L-tryptophan, and these results indicate that substitution of isoleucine at position 83 of the Wex amino acid sequence with a different hydrophobic amino acid can significantly increase the activity of the L-tryptophan output ability of Wex in microorganisms of the genus Escherichia as well as in microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium.
