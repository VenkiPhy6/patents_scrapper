 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Viral hepatitis resulting from a virus other than hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been referred to as non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). NANBH can be further defined based on the mode of transmission of an individual type, for example, enteric versus parenteral. 
 One form of NANBH, known as enterically transmitted NANBH or ET-NANBH, is contracted predominantly in poor-sanitation areas where food and drinking water have been contaminated by fecal matter. The molecular cloning of the causative agent, referred to as the hepatitis E virus (HEV), has recently been described (Reyes et al., 1990; Tam et al.). 
 A second form of NANB, known as parenterally transmitted NANBH, or PT-NANBH, is transmitted by parenteral routes, typically by exposure to blood or blood products. The rate of this hepatitis varied by (i) locale, (ii) whether ALT testing was done in blood banks, and (iii) elimination of high-risk patients for AIDS. Appoximately 10% of transfusions caused PT-NANBH infection and about half of those went on to a chronic disease state (Dienstag). After implementation of anti-HCV testing, HCV seroconversion per unit transfused was decreased to less than 1% among heart surgery patients (Alter). 
 Human plasma samples documented as having produced post-transfusion NANBH in human recipients have been used successfully to produce PT-NANBH infection in chimpanzees (Bradley). RNA isolated from infected chimpanzee plasma has been used to construct cDNA libraries in an expression vector for immunoscreening with serum from human subjects with chronic PT-NANBH infection. This procedure identified a PT-NANBH specific cDNA clone and the viral sequence was then used as a probe to identify a set of overlapping fragments making up 7,300 contiguous basepairs of a PT-NANBH viral agent. The sequenced viral agent has been named the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (for example, the sequence of HCV is presented in EPO patent application 88310922.5, filed Nov. 18, 1988). The full-length sequence (˜9,500 nt) of HCV is now available. 
 Primate transmission studies conducted at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC; Phoenix, Ariz., 1973-1975; 1978-1983) originally provided substantial evidence for the existence of multiple agents of non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH): the primary agents associated with the majority of cases of NANBH are now recognized to be HCV and HEV (see above), for PT-NANBH and ET-NANBH, respectively. Later epidemiologic studies conducted at the CDC (Atlanta, Ga., 1989-present) using both research (prototype) and commercial tests for anti-HCV antibody showed that approximately 20% of all community-acquired NANBH was also non-C. Further testing of these samples for the presence of HEV (Reyes, et al., WO A 9115603 (Genelabs Inc.) 17 Oct. 1991) have indicated that these cases of community-acquired non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis were also non-E. 
 Liver biopsy specimens, sera and plasma of Sentinel County patients (study of Drs. Miriam Alter and Kris Krawczynski) also showed that many bona fide cases of NANBH were also non-C hepatitis (serologically and by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR; Kawasaki, et al.; Wang, et al., 1990) negative for all markers of HCV infection) developed subsequently into chronic hepatitis with presentation of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) or chronic active hepatitis (CAH) consistent with a viral infection. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The invention pertains to the characterization and isolation of a newly discovered NonA/NonB/NonC/NonD/NonE (N-(ABCDE)) hepatitis-associated viral agent, herein designated Hepatitis G Virus (HGV). Disclosed here is a family of cDNA replicas of portions of the HGV genome. Also disclosed are methods for the isolation and characterization of further HGV sequences and sequences of HGV variants. 
 The present invention includes HGV genomic polynucleotides, cDNAs thereto and complements thereof. With respect to polynucleotides, some aspects of the invention include: a purified Hepatitis G Virus genomic polynucleotide; HGV derived RNA and DNA polynucleotides; recombinant HGV polynucleotides; a recombinant polynucleotide making up a sequence derived from HGV or HGV variant cDNA or complementary sequences thereof; a recombinant polynucleotide encoding an epitope of HGV; a recombinant vector including any of the above recombinant polynucleotides, and a host cell transformed with any of these vectors. Another aspect of the invention is a polynucleotide probe for HGV and/or its variants. 
 Current studies on the nature of the genome of HGV, utilizing sequence information to compare HGV to other viral sequences, suggest that HGV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses. 
 Portions of the HGV-derived cDNA sequences are effective as probes to isolate variants of the virus which occur naturally, or to determine the presence of virus in samples. These cDNAs also make available HGV-encoded polypeptide sequences, including HGV-specific polypeptide antigens. These coding sequences allow the production of polypeptides which are useful as reagents in diagnostic tests and/or as components of vaccines, or as standards. Further, it is possible to isolate and sequence other portions of the HGV genome by utilizing probes derived from these cDNAs, therefore giving rise to additional probes and polypeptides useful in the prophylactic, therapeutic and diagnosis applications. 
 Other aspects of the invention include: a recombinant expression system which incorporates an open reading frame (ORF) derived from HGV cDNA or complements thereof, wherein the ORF is linked operably to a control sequence which is compatible with a desired host, a cell transformed with the recombinant expression system, and a polypeptide produced by the transformed cell. 
 Yet another aspect of the invention are purified HGV particles; a preparation of polypeptides from the purified HGV; a purified HGV polypeptide; a purified HGV peptide; and a purified polypeptide which comprises an epitope immunologically identifiable with an epitope contained in HGV or an HGV variant. 
 Included aspects of the invention are an HGV polypeptide; a recombinant polypeptide consisting of a sequence derived from a HGV genome, HGV cDNA or complements thereof; a recombinant polypeptide made of an HGV epitope; and a fusion polypeptide comprised of an HGV polypeptide. 
 Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against HGV epitopes contained within the polypeptide sequences are also useful as therapeutic agents, for diagnostic tests, for the isolation of the HGV agent from which these cDNAs derive, and for screening of antiviral agents. 
 Also included in the invention are a purified preparation of polyclonal antibodies directed against an HGV epitope; and monoclonal antibodies directed against HGV epitopes. 
 Some aspects of the invention pertaining to kits are those for: investigating samples for the presence of polynucleotides derived from HGV which comprise a polynucleotide probe including a nucleotide sequence from HGV of approximately 8 or more nucleotides, in an appropriate container; analyzing samples for the presence of antibodies directed against an HGV antigen made up of a polypeptide which contains an HGV epitope present in the HGV antigen, in a suitable container; and analyzing samples for the presence of HGV antigens made up of an anti-HGV antibody, in a suitable container. 
 Still other aspects of the invention include a polypeptide comprised of an HGV epitope, which is attached to a solid substrate; and an antibody to an HGV epitope, which is attached to a solid substrate. 
 Other aspects of the invention are: a technique for the production of an HGV polypeptide, which includes incubating host cells which are transformed with an expression vector, containing a sequence encoding an HGV polypeptide, under conditions which allow expression of said polypeptide; and a polypeptide which has been produced by this method (containing, for example, an HGV epitope). 
 Also included in the invention are a method for the detection of HGV nucleic acids in samples comprising reacting nucleic acids of the sample with a probe for an HGV polynucleotide, under conditions allowing the creation of a polynucleotide duplex between the probe and the HGV nucleic acid from the sample; as well as detecting a polynucleotide duplex containing the probe. The invention includes the following hybridization based detection methods: reporter labeling; polymerase chain reaction; self-sustained sequence replication; ligase chain reaction; and strand displacement amplification. Further, detection methods include signal amplification (e.g., branch-chained DNA probes and the Q-beta replicase method). 
 The invention also includes immunoassays, including an immunoassay for detecting HGV, comprising the incubation of a sample (which is suspected of being infected with HGV) with a probe antibody directed against an antigen/epitope of HGV, to be detected under conditions allowing the formation of an antigen-antibody complex; and detecting the antigen-antibody complex which contains the probe antibody. An immunoassay for the detection of antibodies which are directed against an HGV antigen comprising the incubation of a sample suspected of containing HGV with a probe polypeptide including an epitope of HGV, under conditions that allow the formation of an antibody-antigen complex; and distinguishing the antibody-antigen complex which contains the probe antigen. 
 Also forming part of the invention are HGV vaccines, for the treatment and/or prevention of HGV infection, comprising an immunogenic peptide containing an HGV epitope, or an inactivated preparation of HGV, or a reduced preparation of HGV. 
 In still another aspect, the invention includes a tissue culture grown cell, infected with HGV. In one embodiment, the tissue culture grown cells are primate liver cells. 
 Another aspect of the invention is a method for producing antibodies to HGV, comprising administering to a test subject an immunogenic polypeptide containing HGV epitopes in an adequate amount to elicit an immune response. 
 The present invention also includes an HGV mosaic polypeptide, where the mosaic polypeptide contains at least two epitopes of HGV, and, where the polypeptide substantially lacks amino acids normally intervening between the epitopes in the native HGV coding sequence. Such mosaic polypeptides are useful in the applications and methods discussed above. 
 The present invention further includes a random peptide epitope (mimitope) that mimics a natural HGV antigenic epitope during epitope presentation. Such mimitopes are useful in the applications and methods discussed above. Also included in the present invention is a method of identifying a random peptide HGV epitope. In the method, a library of random peptide epitopes is generated or selected. The library is contacted with an anti-HGV antibody. Mimitopes are identified that are specifically immunoreactive with the antibody. Sera (containing anti-HGV antibodies) or antibodies generated by the methods of the present invention can be used. Random peptide libraries can, for example, be displayed on phage or generated as combinatorial libraries. 
 In another aspect, the present invention includes therapeutic compounds and methods for the prevention and/or treatment of HGV infection. 
 These and other objects and features of the invention will be more fully appreciated when the following detailed description of the invention is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 I. DEFINITIONS 
 The terms defined below have the following meaning herein: 
 1. "nonA/nonB/nonC/nonD/nonE hepatitis viral agent {N-(ABCDE)}," herein provisionally designated HGV, means a virus, virus type, or virus class which (i) is transmissible in some primates, including, mystax, chimpanzees or humans, as characterized by elevated serum alanine amino-transferase levels in an infected primate (ii) is serologically distinct from hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus, and hepatitis E (HEV) (although HGV may co-infect a subject with these viruses), and (iii) is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. 
 2. "HGV variants" are defined as viral isolates that have at least about 40%, preferably 55% or 65%, or more preferably 80% global sequence homology, that is, sequence identity over a length of the viral genome polynucleotide sequence, to the HGV polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein (e.g., SEQ ID NO:14). 
 "Sequence homology" is determined essentially as follows. Two polynucleotide sequences of similar length (preferably, the entire viral genome) are considered to be homologous to one another, if, when they are aligned using the ALIGN program, over 40%, preferably 55% or 65%, or more preferably 80% of the nucleic acids in the highest scoring alignment are identically aligned using a ktup of 1, the default parameters and the default PAM matrix. 
 The ALIGN program is found in the FASTA version 1.7 suite of sequence comparison programs (Pearson, et al., 1988; Pearson, 1990; program available from William R. Pearson, Department of Biological Chemistry, Box 440, Jordan Hall, Charlottesville, Va.). 
 In determining whether two viruses are "highly homologous" to each other, the complete sequence of all the viral proteins (or the polyprotein) for one virus are optimally, globally aligned with the viral proteins or polyprotein of the other virus using the ALIGN program of the above suite using a ktup of 1, the default parameters and the default PAM matrix. Regions of dissimilarity or similarity are not excluded from the analysis. Differences in lengths between the two sequences are considered as mismatches. Alternatively, viral structural protein regions are typically used to determine relatedness between viral isolates. Highly homologous viruses have over 40%, or preferably 55% or 65%, or more preferably 80% global polypeptide sequence identity. 
 3. Two nucleic acid fragments are considered to be "selectively hybridizable" to an HGV polynucleotide, if they are capable of specifically hybridizing to HGV or a variant thereof (e.g., a probe that hybridizes to HGV nucleic acid but not to polynucleotides from other members of the virus family Flaviviridae) or specifically priming a polymerase chain reaction: (i) under typical hybridization and wash conditions, as described, for example, in Maniatis, et al., pages 320-328, and 382-389, (ii) using reduced stringency wash conditions that allow at most about 25-30% basepair mismatches, for example: 2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, room temperature twice, 30 minutes each; then 2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, 37° C. once, 30 minutes; then 2×SSC room temperature twice, 10 minutes each, or (iii) selecting primers for use in typical polymerase chain reactions (PCR) under standard condition (for example, in Saiki, R. K, et al.), which result in specific amplification of sequences of HGV or its variants. 
 Preferably, highly homologous nucleic acid strands contain less than 20-30% basepair mismatches, even more preferably less than 5-20% basepair mismatches. These degrees of homology can be selected by using wash conditions of appropriate stringency for identification of clones from gene libraries (or other sources of genetic material), as is well known in the art. 
 4. An "HGV polynucleotide," as used herein, is defined as follows. For polynucleotides greater than about 100 nucleotides, HGV polynucleotides encompass polynucleotide sequences encoded by HGV variants and homologous sequences as defined in "2" above. For polynucleotides less than about 100 nucleotides in length, HGV polynucleotide encompasses sequences that selectively hybridizes to sequences of HGV or its variants. Further, HGV polynucleotides include polynucleotides encoding HGV polypeptides (see below). 
 The term "polynucleotide" as used herein refers to a polymeric molecule having a backbone that supports bases capable of hydrogen bonding to typical nucleic acids, where the polymer backbone presents the bases in a manner to permit such hydrogen bonding in a sequence specific fashion between the polymeric molecule and a typically nucleic acid (e.g., single-stranded DNA). Such bases are typically inosine, adenosine, guanosine, cytosine, uracil and thymidine. Numerous polynucleotide modifications are known in the art, for example, labels, methylation, and substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog. 
 Polymeric molecules include double and single stranded RNA and DNA, and backbone modifications thereof, for example, methylphosphonate linkages. Further, such polymeric molecules include alternative polymer backbone structures such as, but not limited to, polyvinyl backbones (Pitha, 1970a/b), morpholino backbones (Summerton, et al., 1992, 1993). A variety of other charged and uncharged polynucleotide analogs have been reported. Numerous backbone modifications are known in the art, including, but not limited to, uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, and carbamates) and charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates and phosphorodithioates). In addition linkages may contain the following exemplary modifications: pendant moieties, such as, proteins (including, for example, nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides and poly-L-lysine); intercalators (e.g., acridine and psoralen), chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron and oxidative metals), alkylators, and other modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids). 
 5. An "HGV polypeptide" is defined herein as any polypeptide homologous to an HGV polypeptide. "Homology," as used herein, is defined as follows. In one embodiment, a polypeptide is homologous to an HGV polypeptide if it is encoded by nucleic acid that selectively hybridizes to sequences of HGV or its variants. 
 In another embodiment, a polypeptide is homologous to an HGV polypeptide if it is encoded by HGV or its variants, as defined above, polypeptides of this group are typically larger than 15, preferable 25, or more preferable 35, contiguous amino acids. Further, for polypeptides longer than about 60 amino acids, sequence comparisons for the purpose of determining "polypeptide homology" are performed using the local alignment program LALIGN. The polypeptide sequence, is compared against the HGV amino acid sequence or any of its variants, as defined above, using the LALIGN program with a ktup of 1, default parameters and the default PAM. 
 Any polypeptide (typically a polypeptide not specifically immunoreactive with HGV antibodies) with an optimal alignment longer than 60 amino acids and greater than 60%, preferably 70%, or more preferably 80% of identically aligned amino acids is considered to be a "homologous polypeptide." The LALIGN program is found in the FASTA version 1.7 suite of sequence comparison programs (Pearson, et al., 1988; Pearson, 1990; program available from William R. Pearson, Department of Biological Chemistry, Box 440, Jordan Hall, Charlottesville, Va.). 
 6. A polynucleotide is "derived from" HGV if it has the same or substantially the same basepair sequence as a region of an HGV genome, cDNA of HGV or complements thereof, or if it displays homology as noted under "2", "3" or "4" above. 
 A polypeptide or polypeptide "fragment" is "derived from" HGV if it is (i) encoded by an open reading frame of an HGV polynucleotide, or (ii) displays homology to HGV polypeptides as noted under "2" and "5" above, or (iii) is specifically immunoreactive with HGV positive sera. 
 7. "Substantially isolated" and "purified" are used in several contexts and typically refer to at least partial purification of an HGV virus particle, component (e.g., polynucleotide or polypeptide), or related compound (e.g., anti-HGV antibodies) away from unrelated or contaminating components (e.g., serum cells, proteins, non-HGV polynucleotides and non-anti-HGV antibodies). Methods and procedures for the isolation or purification of compounds or components of interest are described below (e.g., affinity purification of fusion proteins and recombinant production of HGV polypeptides). 
 8. In the context of the present invention, the phrase "nucleic acid sequences," when referring to sequences which encode a protein, polypeptide, or peptide, is meant to include degenerative nucleic acid sequences which encode homologous protein, polypeptide or peptide sequences as well as the disclosed sequence. 
 9. An "epitope" is the antigenic determinant defined as the specific portion of an antigen with which the antigen binding portion of a specific antibody interacts. 
 10. An antigen or epitope is "specifically immunoreactive" with HGV positive sera when the epitope/antigen binds to antibodies present in the HGV infected sera but does not bind to antibodies present in the majority (greater than about 90%, preferably greater than 95%) of sera from individuals who are not or have not been infected with HGV. "Specifically immunoreactive" antigens or epitopes may also be immunoreactive with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies generated against specific HGV epitopes or antigens. 
 An antibody or antibody composition (e.g., polyclonal antibodies) is "specifically immunoreactive" with HGV when the antibody or antibody composition is immunoreactive with an HGV antigen but not with HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV or HEV antigens. Further, "specifically immunoreactive antibodies" are not immunoreactive with antigens typically present in normal sera obtained from subjects not infected with or exposed to HGV, HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV or HEV. 
 II. N-(ABCDE) Sera 
 Availability of a serologic test for anti-HCV and the development of an RT-PCR assay for HCV-RNA (Kawasaki, et al.; Wang, et al., 1990) allowed the identification of several cases of both post-transfusion and community acquired non-HCV hepatitis. The human hepatitis case, PNF 2161, was originally identified as having NANB hepatitis (NANBH) through the Sentinel Counties Study of community acquired hepatitis, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Alter, et al., 1989b). PNF 2161 was a sample obtained from an elderly Caucasian male patient who developed acute hepatitis approximately 8 weeks following a blood transfusion, with a peak serum ALT level of 1141 IU (normal, ≦45 IU). Following resolution of the episode of acute hepatitis, he had fluctuating, but persistently elevated ALT levels over the next seven years, consistent with chronic hepatitis, although histopathologic confirmation of this diagnosis was not obtained. 
 The plasma specimen used to clone HGV (as described herein) was obtained in June 1989, approximately 4 1/2  years following the episode of acute hepatitis, and cryo-preserved. Patient PNF 2161 was initially believed not to be infected with HCV, based on consistently negative results with a first generation immunoassay test (Ortho HCV ELISA Test System; Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan, N.J.). However, subsequent testing using a second generation HCV immunoassay (Ortho) and PCR with HCV 5'-non-coding region primers demonstrated that the patient was infected with HCV. 
 III. Isolation of HGV Associated Sequences 
 As one approach toward identifying clones containing HGV sequences, a cDNA library was prepared from infected-HGV sera in the expression vector lambda gt11 (Example 1). Polynucleotide sequences were then selected for the expression of peptides which are immunoreactive with serum PNF 2161. First round screening was typically performed using the PNF 2161 serum (used to generate the phage library). It is also possible to screen with other suspected N-(ABCDE) sera. 
 Recombinant proteins identified by this approach provide candidates for peptides which can serve as substrates in diagnostic tests. Further, the nucleic acid coding sequences identified by this approach serve as useful hybridization probes for the identification of additional HGV coding sequences. 
 The sera described above were used to generate cDNA libraries in lambda gt11 (Example 1). In the method illustrated in Example 1, infected serum was precipitated in 8% PEG without dilution, and the libraries were generated from the resulting pelleted virus. Sera from infected human sources were treated in the same fashion. 
 As an advantageous alternative to PEG precipitation, ultracentrifugation can be used to pellet particulate agents from infected sera or other biological specimens. To isolate viral particles from which nucleic acids could be extracted, serum, ranging up to 2 ml, is diluted to approximately 10 ml with PBS, spun at 3K for 10 minutes, and the supernatant is centrifuged for a minimum of 2 hours at 40,000 rpm (approximately 110,000×g) in a Ti70.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, Calif.) at 4° C. The supernatant is then aspirated and the pellet extracted by standard nucleic acid extraction techniques. 
 cDNA libraries were generated using random primers in reverse transcription reactions with RNA extracted from pelleted sera as starting material. The resulting molecules were ligated to Sequence Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA; Reyes, et al., 1991) linker primers and expanded in a non-selective manner, and then cloned into a suitable vector, for example, lambda gt11, for expression and screening of peptide antigens. Alternatively, the lambda gt10 vector may also be used. 
 Lambda gt11 is a particularly useful expression vector which contains a unique EcoRI insertion site 53 base pairs upstream of the translation termination codon of the β-galactosidase gene. Thus, an inserted sequence is expressed as a β-galactosidase fusion protein which contains the N-terminal portion of the β-galactosidase gene product, the heterologous peptide, and optionally the C-terminal region of the β-galactosidase peptide (the C-terminal portion being expressed when the heterologous peptide coding sequence does not contain a translation termination codon). 
 This vector also produces a temperature-sensitive repressor (cI857) which causes viral lysogeny at permissive temperatures, e.g., 32° C., and leads to viral lysis at elevated temperatures, e.g., 42° C. Advantages of this vector include: (1) highly efficient recombinant clone generation, (2) ability to select lysogenized host cells on the basis of host-cell growth at permissive, but not non-permissive, temperatures, and (3) production of recombinant fusion protein. Further, since phage containing a heterologous insert produces an inactive β-galactosidase enzyme, phage with inserts are typically identified using a calorimetric substrate conversion reaction employing β-galactosidase. 
 Example 1 describes the preparation of a cDNA library for the N-(ABCDE) hepatitis sera PNF 2161. The library was immunoscreened using PNF 2161 (Example 3). A number of lambda gt11 clones were identified which were immunoreactive. Immunopositive clones were plaque-purified and their immunoreactivity retested. Also, the immunoreactivity of the clones with normal human sera was also tested. 
 These clones were also examined for the "exogenous" nature of the cloned insert sequence. This basic test establishes that the cloned fragment does not represent a portion of human or other potentially contaminating nucleic acids (e.g., E. coli, S. cerevisiea and mitochondrial). The clone inserts were isolated by EcoRI digestion following polymerase chain reaction amplification. The inserts were purified then radiolabelled and used as hybridization probes against membrane bound normal human DNA, normal mystax DNA and bacterial DNA (control DNAs) (Example 4A). 
 Clone 470-20-1 (PNF2161 cDNA source) was one of the clones isolated by immunoscreening with the PNF 2161 serum. The clone was not reactive with normal human sera. The clone has a large open reading frame (203 base pairs; SEQ ID NO:3), in-frame with the β-galactosidase gene of the lambda gt11 vector. The clone is exogenous by genomic DNA hybridization analysis and genomic PCR analysis, using human, yeast and E. coli genomic DNAs (Example 4B). 
 The sequence was present in PNF2161 serum as determined by RT-PCR (Example 4C). RT-PCR of serially diluted PNF 2161 RNA suggested at least about 10 5  copies of 470-20-1 specific sequence per ml. The sequence was also detected in sucrose density gradient fractions at densities consistent with the sequence banding in association with a virus-like particle (Example 5). 
 Bacterial lysates of E. coli expressing a second clone, clone 470-exp1, (SEQ ID NO:37) were also shown to be specifically immunoreactive with PNF 2161 serum at comparable levels to clone 470-20-1. The coding sequence of 470-exp1 was flanked by termination codons (based on sequence comparisons to SEQ ID NO:14, also see FIG. 1) and had an internal methionine. 
 Further sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:14, adjacent to clone 470-20-1, were obtained by anchor polymerase chain reaction (Anchor PCR) using primers from clone 470-20-1 (Example 6). In this case a PNF 2161 2-cDNA source library was used as template, where the cDNA/complement double-stranded DNA products were ligated to lambda arms, but the mixture was not packaged. 
 470-20-1 specific primers were used in amplification reactions with SISPA-amplified PNF 2161 cDNA as a template (Example 4). The identity of the amplified DNA fragments were confirmed by (i) size and (ii) hybridization with a 470-20-1 specific oligonucleotide probe (SEQ ID NO:16). The 470-20-1 specific signal was detected in cDNA amplified by PCR from SISPA-amplified PNF 2161, demonstrating the presence of the 470-20-1 sequences in the source material. 
 The 470-20-1 specific primers were also used in amplification reactions with the following RNA sources as substrate: normal mystax liver RNA, normal tamarin (Sanguins laboriatis) liver RNA, and MY131 liver RNA (Example 4). The results from these experiments demonstrate the 470-20-1 sequences are present in the parent serum sample (PNF 2161) and in an RNA liver sample from an animal challenged with the PNF 2161 sample (MY131). Both normal control RNAs were negative for the presence of 470-20-1 sequences. 
 Further, PNF 2161 serum and other cloning source or related source materials were directly tested by PCR using primers from selected cloned sequences. Specific amplification products were detected by hybridization to a specific oligonucleotide probe 470-20-1-152F (SEQ ID NO:16). A specific signal was reproducibly detected in multiple extracts of PNF 2161, with the 470-20-1 specific primers. 
 The disease association between HGV and liver disease is further supported by the data presented in Example 4F. Sera from hepatitis patients and from blood donors with abnormal liver function were assessed for the presence of HGV by RT-PCR screening, using HGV specific primers. HGV specific sequence were detected in 6/152 of these sera samples. No HGV positives were detected among the control samples (n=11). 
 The results presented above indicate the isolation of a viral agent associated with N-(ABCDE) viral infection of liver (i.e., hepatitis) and/or infection, and resulting disease, of other tissue and cell types. 
 IV. Further Characterization of HGV Recombinant Antigens 
 A. Screening Recombinant Libraries 
 Further candidate HGV antigens can be obtained from the libraries of the present invention using the screening methods described above. The cDNA library described above has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Md., 20852, and has been assigned the following designation: PNF 2161 cDNA source, ATCC 75268. The deposit was accepted by the International Depository Authority on Jul. 16, 1992. 
 A second PNF 2161 cDNA library has been generated essentially as described for the first PNF 2161 cDNA library, except that second PNF 2161 cDNA source library was ligated to lambda gt11 arms but was not packaged. This non-packaged library was used to obtain the extension clones described below. A packaged version of this second library (PNF 2161 2-cDNA source library) has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., 20852, and has been assigned the following designation: PNF 2161 2-cDNA source, ATCC 75837. The deposit was accepted by the International Depository Authority on Jul. 22, 1994. 
 In addition to the recombinant libraries generated above, other recombinant libraries from N-(ABCDE) hepatitis sera can likewise be generated and screened as described herein. 
 B. Epitope Mapping, Cross Hybridization and Isolation of Genomic Sequences 
 Antigen encoding DNA fragments can be identified by (i) immunoscreening, as described above, or (ii) computer analysis of coding sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO:14) using an algorithm (such as, "ANTIGEN," Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.) to identify potential antigenic regions. An antigen-encoding DNA fragment can be subcloned. The subcloned insert can then be fragmented by partial DNase I digestion to generate random fragments or by specific restriction endonuclease digestion to produce specific subfragments. The resulting DNA fragments can be inserted into the lambda gt11 vector and subjected to immunoscreening in order to provide an epitope map of the cloned insert. 
 In addition, the DNA fragments can be employed as probes in hybridization experiments to identify overlapping HGV sequences, and these in turn can be further used as probes to identify a set of contiguous clones. The generation of sets of contiguous clones allows the elucidation of the sequence of the HGV's genome. 
 Any of the above-described clone sequences (e.g., derived from SEQ ID NO:14 or clone 470-20-1) can be used to probe the cDNA and DNA libraries, generated in a vector such as lambda gt10 or "LAMBDA ZAP II" (Stratagene, San Diego, Calif.). Specific subfragments of known sequence may be isolated by polymerase chain reaction or after restriction endonuclease cleavage of vectors carrying such sequences. The resulting DNA fragments can be used as radiolabelled probes against any selected library. In particular, the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of the clone inserts are useful as probes to identify additional clones. 
 Further, the sequences provided by the 5' end of cloned inserts are useful as sequence specific primers in first-strand cDNA or DNA synthesis reactions (Maniatis et al.; Scharf et al.). For example, specifically primed PNF 2161 cDNA and DNA libraries can be prepared by using specific primers derived from SEQ ID NO:14 on PNF 2161 nucleic acids as a template. The second-strand of the new cDNA is synthesized using RNase H and DNA polymerase I. The above procedures identify or produce DNA/cDNA molecules corresponding to nucleic acid regions that are 5' adjacent to the known clone insert sequences. These newly isolated sequences can in turn be used to identify further flanking sequences, and so on, to identify the sequences composing the entire genome for HGV. As described above, after new HGV sequences are isolated, the polynucleotides can be cloned and immunoscreened to identify specific sequences encoding HGV antigens. 
 Extension clone sequences (SEQ ID NO:14), containing further sequences of interest, have been obtained for clone PNF 470-20-1 (SEQ ID NO:3) using the "Anchor PCR" method described in Example 6. Briefly, the strategy consists of ligating PNF 2161 SISPA cDNA to lambda gt11 arms and amplifying the ligation reaction with a gt11-specific primer and one of two 470-20-1 specific primers. 
 The amplification products are electrophoretically separated, transferred to filters and the DNA bound to the filters is probed with a 470-20-1 specific probe. Bands corresponding to hybridization positive band signals were gel purified, cloned and sequenced. 
 C. Preparation of Antigenic Polypeptides and Antibodies 
 The recombinant peptides of the present invention can be purified by standard protein purification procedures which may include differential precipitation, molecular sieve chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing, gel electrophoresis and affinity chromatography. 
 In one embodiment of the present invention, the polynucleotide sequences of the antigens of the present invention have been cloned in the plasmid p-GEX (Example 7A) or various derivatives thereof (pGEX-GLI). The plasmid pGEX (Smith, et al., 1988) and its derivatives express the polypeptide sequences of a cloned insert fused in-frame to the protein glutathione-S-transferase (sj26). In one vector construction, plasmid pGEX-hisB, an amino acid sequence of 6 histidines is introduced at the carboxy terminus of the fusion protein. 
 The various recombinant pGEX plasmids can be transformed into appropriate strains of E. coli and fusion protein production can be induced by the addition of IPTG (isopropyl-thio galactopyranoside) as described in Example 7A. Solubilized recombinant fusion protein can then be purified from cell lysates of the induced cultures using glutathione agarose affinity chromatography (Example 7A). 
 Insoluble fusion protein expressed by the plasmid pGEX-hisB can be purified by means of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (Porath) in buffers containing 6M Urea or 6M guanidinium isothiocyanate, both of which are useful for the solubilization of proteins. Alternatively insoluble proteins expressed in pGEX-GLI or derivatives thereof can be purified using combinations of centrifugation to remove soluble proteins followed by solubilization of insoluble proteins and standard chromatographic methodologies, such as ion exchange or size exclusion chromatography, and other such methods are known in the art. 
 In the case of β-galactosidase fusion proteins (such as those produced by lambda gt11 clones) the fused protein can be isolated readily by affinity chromatography, by passing cell lysis material over a solid support having surface-bound anti-β-galactosidase antibody. For example, purification of a β-galactosidase/fusion protein, derived from 470-20-1 coding sequences, by affinity chromatography is described in Example 7B. 
 Also included in the invention is an expression vector, such as the lambda gt11 or pGEX vectors described above, containing HGV coding sequences and expression control elements which allow expression of the coding regions in a suitable host. The control elements generally include a promoter, translation initiation codon, and translation and transcription termination sequences, and an insertion site for introducing the insert into the vector. 
 The DNA encoding the desired antigenic polypeptide can be cloned into any number of commercially available vectors to generate expression of the polypeptide in the appropriate host system. These systems include, but are not limited to, the following: baculovirus expression (Reilly, et al.; Beames, et al.; Pharmingen; Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.), vaccinia expression (Earl, 1991; Moss, et al.), expression in bacteria (Ausubel, et al.; Clontech), expression in yeast (Gellissen, 1992; Romanos, 1992; Goeddel; Guthrie and Fink), expression in mammalian cells (Clontech; Gibco-BRL, Ground Island, N.Y.), e.g., Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines (Haynes, 1983, Lau, 1984, Kaufman, 1990). These recombinant polypeptide antigens can be expressed directly or as fusion proteins. A number of features can be engineered into the expression vectors, such as leader sequences which promote the secretion of the expressed sequences into culture medium. 
 Expression of large HGV polypeptides using several of these systems is described in Example 16. 
 Expression in yeast systems has the advantage of commercial production. Recombinant protein production by vaccinia and CHO cell line have the advantage of being mammalian expression systems. Further, vaccinia virus expression has several advantages including the following: (i) its wide host range; (ii) faithful post-transcriptional modification, processing, folding, transport, secretion, and assembly of recombinant proteins; (iii) high level expression of relatively soluble recombinant proteins; and (iv) a large capacity to accommodate foreign DNA. 
 The recombinant expressed polypeptide produced HGV polypeptide antigens are typically isolated from lysed cells or culture media. Purification can be carried out by methods known in the art including salt fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Immunoaffinity chromatography can be employed using antibodies generated based on the HGV antigens identified by the methods of the present invention. 
 HGV polypeptide antigens may also be isolated from HGV particles (see below). 
 Continuous antigenic determinants of polypeptides are generally relatively small, typically 6 to 10 amino acids in length. Smaller fragments have been identified as antigenic regions, for example, in conformational epitopes. HGV polypeptide antigens are identified as described above. The resulting DNA coding regions of either strand can be expressed recombinantly either as fusion proteins or isolated polypeptides. In addition, amino acid sequences can be conveniently chemically synthesized using commercially available synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) or "PIN" technology (Applied Biosytems). 
 In another embodiment, the present invention includes mosaic proteins that are composed of multiple epitopes. An HGV mosaic polypeptide typically contains at least two epitopes of HGV, where the polypeptide substantially lacks amino acids normally intervening between the epitopes in the native HGV coding sequence. Synthetic genes (Crea; Yoshio et al.; Eaton et al.) encoding multiple, tandem epitopes can be constructed that will produce mosaic proteins using standard recombinant DNA technology using polypeptide expression vector/host system described above. 
 Further, multiple antigen peptides can be synthesized chemically by methods described previously (Tam, J. P., 1988; Briand et al.). For example, a small immunologically inert core matrix of lysine residues with α- and e-amino groups can be used to anchor multiple copies of the same or different synthetic peptides (typically 6-15 residues long) representing epitopes of interest. Mosaic proteins or multiple antigen peptide antigens give higher sensitivity and specificity in immunoassays due to the signal amplification resulting from distribution of multiple epitopes. 
 Antigens obtained by any of these methods can be used for antibody generation, diagnostic tests and vaccine development. 
 In another aspect, the invention includes specific antibodies directed against the polypeptide antigens of the present invention. Antigens obtained by any of these methods may be directly used for the generation of antibodies or they may be coupled to appropriate carrier molecules. Many such carriers are known in the art and are commercially available (e.g., Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Typically, to prepare antibodies, a host animal, such as a rabbit, is immunized with the purified antigen or fused protein antigen. Hybrid, or fused, proteins may be generated using a variety of coding sequence derived from other proteins, such as glutathione-S-transferase or β-galactosidase. The host serum or plasma is collected following an appropriate time interval, and this serum is tested for antibodies specific against the antigen. Example 8 describes the production of rabbit serum antibodies which are specific against the 470-20-1 antigen in the Sj26/470-20-1 hybrid protein. These techniques are equally applicable to all immunogenic sequences derived from HGV, including, but not limited to, those derived from the coding sequence presented as SEQ ID NO:14. 
 The gamma globulin fraction or the IgG antibodies of immunized animals can be obtained, for example, by use of saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation or DEAE Sephadex chromatography, affinity chromatography, or other techniques known to those skilled in the art for producing polyclonal antibodies. 
 Alternatively, purified antigen or fused antigen protein may be used for producing monoclonal antibodies. Here the spleen or lymphocytes from an immunized animal are removed and immortalized or used to prepare hybridomas by methods known to those skilled in the art. To produce a human-derived hybridoma, a human lymphocyte donor is selected. A donor known to be infected with a HGV may serve as a suitable lymphocyte donor. Lymphocytes can be isolated from a peripheral blood sample. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be used to immortalize human lymphocytes or a suitable fusion partner can be used to produce human-derived hybridomas. Primary in vitro sensitization with viral specific polypeptides can also be used in the generation of human monoclonal antibodies. 
 Antibodies secreted by the immortalized cells are screened to determine the clones that secrete antibodies of the desired specificity, for example, by using the ELISA or Western blot method (Example 10; Ausubel et al.). 
 Using HGV-positive serum or plasma, or the antibodies of the present invention, other antigenic peptides and epitopes can be isolated. For example, a number of different techniques have been developed for the simultaneous synthesis of many peptides (Geysen, et al.; Houghten; Frank and Doring; Hudson). The method developed by Geysen, et al., is especially useful because of the relative simplicity with which large numbers of different peptide sequences can be generated and tested for antigenicity. In the Geysen method (also referred to as MULTI-PIN peptide synthesis), the peptides are synthesized on polyacrylamide acid grafted polyethylene rods attached to a micro-titer plate. The MULTI-PIN strategy allows large numbers of syntheses (96 peptides per plate) to be immunologically screened using the polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies of the present invention and commercially available reagents and instrumentation. Immunoreactive peptides are identified and characterized. 
 It has been reported that up to 6,000 oligopeptides can be synthesized in a two week period, thus making it practical (by synthesizing all of the possible overlapping amino acid sequences of a particular antigen) to screen viral antigen sequences for epitopes to the resolution of a single amino acid (Geysen, et al.). 
 An alternative method of scanning for immunodominate peptides is to synthesize longer peptides (e.g., 10 to 30 amino acids) corresponding to HGV coding sequences using conventional automated peptide synthesis (Carter, et al., 1994; Obeid, et al., 1994; Commandaeur, et al., 1994). This method has the advantage that the longer peptides can fold into shapes that mimic conformational epitopes. 
 Also, HGV antibodies, in particular, monoclonals, can be used to identify random polypeptides that mimic their virus-encoded target polypeptides (Scott and Smith, 1990; Smith, 1991). For example, random peptide libraries displayed on phage (RPL) (Scott and Smith, 1990) can be used as a source of peptide ligands for antibody generation or for vaccine development. RPL approach allows the expression of peptide-ligand containing fusion proteins on the phage surface and enrichment of these ligand encoding phages by affinity selection using antibodies (Smith, J. P., 1991; Christian, et al.; Scott, et al., 1992; Folgori, et al.). These random peptide epitopes detected by specific antibodies mimic the natural antigenic epitopes (mimotopes) during epitope presentation. HGV antigenic mimics (mimotopes) can be isolated from RPL. Hexa- to decapeptide phagotope (mimotope displayed on phage) expressing RPL can be made by published methods (Scott and Smith; Smith, J. P, 1991; Christian, et al.; Scott, et al.; DeGraaf, et al.; Folgori, et al.) and screened by HGV-associated human sera or the antibodies of the present invention. 
 One example of the use of RPL for isolation of 470-20-1 mimotopes is as follows. The random decapeptide-pIII fusion phage display library is constructed according to the methods described previously (DeGraaf, et al., 1993). Briefly, a chemically synthesized single-stranded degenerate insert is annealed to shorter oligonucleotides which generate SfiI restriction overhangs. Annealed DNA is ligated into SfiI-cut fUSE-5 vector DNA. 
 E. coli MC1061 is transformed with the ligated DNA. The library is amplified through approximately ten population doublings in LB medium with 20 mg/ml tetracycline. This library is affinity selected using one or more of 470-20-1 immunoreactive sera (or antibodies of the present invention). Polystyrene beads (Precision Plastic Ball Company, Chicago, Ill.) are coated with ammonium sulfate fractionated positive serum (e.g., PNF 2161) in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6 overnight at 4 C. Antibody coated beads are thoroughly washed with PBS and blocked with BSA. 
 These serum coated, blocked beads are pre-incubated with an excess of M13K07-UV killed phage for 4 hours at 4° C. Library phage are then added to the above pre-incubation mixture and incubated for 12 hours at 4° C. Unbound phage are removed and the beads are washed extensively with TTB (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% " TWEEN  20" (v/v), 1 mg/ml BSA) buffer. Bound phage are eluted with elution buffer (0.1M HCl adjusted to pH 2.2 with 2M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). Eluted, enriched phage are screened with a second positive serum (e.g., Mys 136 sera) by plaque immunoscreening. 
 Further screening of the selected phagotopes can be carried out using large panels of positive and negative sera or specific HGV monoclonal antibodies. Selected phagotopes can be used directly in ELISA assay or antibody generation. Alternatively, the sequences of the phagotope encoding nucleotides can be determined and expressed in conventional vector/host system and used as antigen. 
 Mimic polypeptides identified as described above can in turn can serve as antigens in detection assays or can be used for the generation of antigen-specific antibodies. 
 D. ELISA and Protein Blot Screening 
 When HGV antigens are identified, typically through plaque immunoscreening as described above, the antigens can be expressed and purified. The antigens can then be screened rapidly against a large number of suspected HGV hepatitis sera using alternative immunoassays, such as, ELISAs or Protein Blot Assays (Western blots) employing the isolated antigen peptide. The antigen polypeptides fusion can be isolated as described above, usually by affinity chromatography to the fusion partner such as β-galactosidase or glutathione-S-transferase. Alternatively, the antigen itself can be purified using antibodies generated against it (see below). 
 A general ELISA assay format is presented in Example 10. Harlow, et al., describe a number of useful techniques for immunoassays and antibody/antigen screening. 
 The purified antigen polypeptide or fusion polypeptide containing the antigen of interest, is attached to a solid support, for example, a multiwell polystyrene plate. Sera to be tested are diluted and added to the wells. After a period of time sufficient for the binding of antibodies to the bound antigens, the sera are washed out of the wells. A labelled reporter antibody is added to each well along with an appropriate substrate: wells containing antibodies bound to the purified antigen polypeptide or fusion polypeptide containing the antigen are detected by a positive signal. 
 A typical format for protein blot analysis using the polypeptide antigens of the present invention is presented in Example 10. General protein blotting methods are described by Ausubel, et al. In Example 10, the 470-20-l/sj26 fusion protein was used to screen a number of sera samples. The results presented in Example 10 demonstrate that several different source N-(ABCDE) hepatitis sera are immunoreactive with the polypeptide antigen. 
 The results presented above demonstrate that the polypeptide antigens of the present invention can, by these methods, be rapidly screened against panels of suspected HGV infected serum samples for the detection of HGV. 
 E. Cell Culture Systems, Animal Models and Isolation of HGV 
 HGV infectivity studies have been carried out in chimpanzees, cynomolgus monkey and four mystax subjects (Example 4H). These studies have yielded further information about HGV infectivity in these animal models. The HGV described in the present specification have the advantage of being capable of infecting tamarins, cynomologous monkeys and chimpanzees. 
 Alternatively, primary hepatocytes obtained from infected animals (chimpanzees, baboons, monkeys, or humans) can be cultured in vitro. A serum-free medium, supplemented with growth factors and hormones, has been described which permits the long-term maintenance of differentiated primate hepatocytes (Lanford, et al.; Jacob, et al., 1989, 1990, 1991). In addition to primary hepatocyte cultures, immortalized cultures of infected cells may also be generated. For example, primary liver cultures may be fused to a variety of cells (like HepG2) to provide stable immortalized cell lines. Primary hepatocyte cell cultures may also be immortalized by introduction of oncogenes or genes causing a transformed phenotype. Such oncogenes or genes can be derived from a number of sources known in the art including SV40, human cellular oncogenes and Epstein Barr Virus. 
 Further, the un-infected hepatocytes (e.g., primary or continuous hepatoma cell lines) may be infected by exposing the cells in culture to the HGV either as partially purified particle preparations (prepared, for example, from infected sera by differential centrifugation and/or molecular sieving) or in infectious sera. These infected cells can then be propagated and the virus passaged by methods known in the art. In addition, other cell types, such as lymphoid cell lines, may be useful for the propagation of HGV. 
 Protein similarity studies of HGV have detected amino acid regions similar to other viruses in the family Flaviviridae. It is known that members of this family of viruses can be propagated in a variety of tissue culture systems (ATCC-Viruses catalogue, 1990). By analogy it is likely that HGV can be propagated in one or more of the following tissue culture systems: Hela cells, primary hamster kidney cells, monkey kidney cells, vero cells, LLC-MK2 (rhesus monkey kidney cells), KB cells(human oral epidermoid carcinoma cells), duck embryo cells, primary sheep leptomeningeal cells, primary sheep choroid plexus cells, pig kidney cells, bovine embryonic kidney cells, bovine turbinate cells, chick embryo cells, primary rabbit kidney cells, BHD-21 cells, or PK-13 cells. 
 In addition to expression of HGV, regions of HGV polynucleotide sequences, cDNA or in vitro transcribed RNA can be introduced by recombinant means into tissue culture cells. Such recombinant manipulations allow the individual expression of individual components of the HGV. 
 RNA samples can be prepared from infected tissue or, in particular, from infected cell cultures. The RNA samples can be fractionated on gels and transferred to membranes for hybridization analysis using probes derived from the cloned HGV sequences. 
 HGV particles may be isolated from infected sera, infected tissue, the above-described cell culture media, or the cultured infected cells by methods known in the art. Such methods include techniques based on size fractionation (i.e., ultrafiltration, precipitation, sedimentation), using anionic and/or cationic exchange materials, separation on the basis of density, hydrophilic properties, and affinity chromatography. During the isolation procedure the HGV can be identified (i) using the anti-HGV hepatitis associated agent antibodies of the present invention, (ii) by using hybridization probes based on identified HGV nucleic acid sequences (e.g., Example 5) or (iii) by RT-PCR. 
 Antibodies directed against HGV can be used in purification of HGV particles through immunoaffinity chromatography (Harlow, et al.; Pierce). Antibodies directed against HGV polypeptides or fusion polypeptides (such as 470-20-1) are fixed to solid supports in such a manner that the antibodies maintain their immunoselectivity. To accomplish such attachment of antibodies to solid support bifunctional coupling agents (Pierce; Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) containing spacer groups are frequently used to retain accessibility of the antigen binding site of the antibody. 
 HGV particles can be further characterized by standard procedures including, but not limited to, immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, Western blot analysis of proteins composing the particles, infection studies in animal and/or cell systems utilizing the partially purified particles, and sedimentation characteristics. The results presented in Example 5 suggest that the viral particle of the present invention is more similar to an enveloped viral particle than to a non-enveloped viral particle. 
 HGV particles can be disrupted to obtain HGV genomes. Disruption of the particles can be achieved by, for example, treatment with detergents in the presence of chelating agents. The genomic nucleic acid can then be further characterized. Characterization may include analysis of DNase and RNase sensitivity. The strandedness (Example 4I) and conformation (e.g., circular) of the genome can be determined by techniques known in the art, including visualization by electron microscopy and sedimentation characteristics. 
 The isolated genomes also make it possible to sequence the entire genome whether it is segmented or not, and whether it is an RNA or DNA genome (using, for example RT-PCR, chromosome walking techniques, or PCR which utilizes primers from adjacent cloned sequences). Determination of the entire sequence of HGV allows genomic organization studies and the comparison of the HGV sequences to the coding and regulatory sequences of known viral agents. 
 F. Screening for Agents Having Anti-HGV Hepatitis Activity 
 The use of cell culture and animal model systems for propagation of HGV provides the ability to screen for anti-hepatitis agents which inhibit the production of infectious HGV: in particular, drugs that inhibit the replication of HGV. Cell culture and animal models allow the evaluation of the effect of such anti-hepatitis drugs on normal cellular functions and viability. Potential anti-viral agents (including natural products or synthetic compounds; for example, small molecules, complex mixtures such as fungal extracts, and anti-sense oligonucleotides) are typically screened for anti-viral activity over a range of concentrations. The effect on HGV replication and/or antigen production is then evaluated, typically by monitering viral macromolecular synthesis or accumulation of macromolecules (e.g., DNA, RNA or protein). This evaluation is often made relative to the effect of the anti-viral agent on normal cellular function (DNA replication, RNA transcription, general protein translation, etc.). 
 The detection of the HGV can be accomplished by many methods including those described in the present specification. For example, antibodies can be generated against the antigens of the present invention and these antibodies used in antibody-based assays (Harlow, et al.) to identify and quantitate HGV antigens in cell culture. HGV antigens can be quantitated in culture using competition assays: polypeptides encoded by the cloned HGV sequences can be used in such assays. Typically, a recombinantly produced HGV antigenic polypeptide is produced and used to generate a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The recombinant HGV polypeptide is labelled using a reporter molecule. The inhibition of binding of this labelled polypeptide to its cognate antibody is then evaluated in the presence of samples (e.g., cell culture media or sera) that contain HGV antigens. The level of HGV antigens in the sample is determined by comparison of levels of inhibition to a standard curve generated using unlabelled recombinant proteins at known concentrations. 
 The HGV sequences of the present invention are particularly useful for the generation of polynucleotide probes/primers that may be used to quantitate the amount of HGV nucleic acid sequences produced in a cell culture system. Such quantification can be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, probes labelled with reporter molecules can be used in standard dot-blot hybridizations or competition assays of labelled probes with infected cell nucleic acids. Further, there are a number of methods using the polymerase chain reaction to quantitate target nucleic acid levels in a sample (Osikowicz, et al.). 
 Protective antibodies can also be identified using the cell culture and animal model systems described above. For example, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are generated against the antigens of the present invention. These antibodies are then used to pre-treat an infectious HGV-containing inoculum (e.g., serum) before infection of cell cultures or animals. The ability of a single antibody or mixtures of antibodies to protect the cell culture or animal from infection is evaluated. For example, in cell culture and animals the absence of viral antigen and/or nucleic acid production serves as a screen. Further in animals, the absence of HGV hepatitis disease symptoms, e.g., elevated ALT values, is also indicative of the presence of protective antibodies. 
 Alternatively, convalescent sera can be screened for the presence of protective antibodies and then these sera used to identify HGV hepatitis associated agent antigens that bind with the antibodies. The identified HGV antigen is then recombinantly or synthetically produced. The ability of the antigen to generate protective antibodies is tested as above. 
 After initial screening, the antigen or antigens identified as capable of generating protective antibodies, either singly or in combination, can be used as a vaccine to inoculate test animals. The animals are then challenged with infectious HGV. Protection from infection indicates the ability of the animals to generate antibodies that protect them from infection. Further, use of the animal models allows identification of antigens that activate cellular immunity. 
 In animal model studies, a protective immune response in response to challenge by a viral preparation (e.g., infected serum) (i) protects the animal from infection or (ii) prevents manifestation of disease. 
 G. Vaccines and the Generation of Protective Immunity 
 Vaccines can be prepared from one or more of the immunogenic polypeptides identified by the method of the present invention. Genomic organization similarities between the isolated sequences from HGV and other known viral proteins may provide information concerning the polypeptides that are likely to be candidates for effective vaccines. In addition, a number of computer programs can be used for to identify likely regions of isolated sequences that encode protein antigenic determinant regions (for example, Hopp, et al.; "ANTIGEN," Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.). 
 Vaccines containing immunogenic polypeptides as active ingredients are typically prepared as injectables either as solutions or suspensions. Further, the immunogenic polypeptides may be prepared in a solid or lyophilized state that is suitable for resuspension, prior to injection, in an aqueous form. The immunogenic polypeptides may also be emulsified or encapsulated in liposomes. The polypeptides are frequently mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are compatible with the polypeptides. Such excipients include, but are not limited to, the following and combinations of the following: saline, water, sugars (such as dextrose and sorbitol), glycerol, alcohols (such as ethanol  EtOH!), and others known in the art. Further, vaccine preparations may contain minor amounts of other auxiliary substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents (e.g., detergents), and pH buffering agents. In addition, a number of adjuvants are available which may enhance the effectiveness of vaccine preparations. Examples of such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, the following: the group of related compounds including N-acetyl-muranyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine and N-acetyl-nor-muranyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, and aluminum hydroxide. 
 The immunogenic polypeptides used in the vaccines of the present invention may be recombinant, synthetic or isolated from, for example, attenuated HGV particles. The polypeptides are commonly formulated into vaccines in neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic salts are well known in the art. 
 HGV hepatitis associated agent vaccines are parenterally administered, typically by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Other possible formulations include oral and suppository formulations. Oral formulations commonly employ excipients (e.g., pharmaceutical grade sugars, saccharine, cellulose, and the like) and usually contain within 10-98% immunogenic polypeptide. Oral compositions take the form of pills, capsules, tablets, solutions, suspensions, powders, etc., and may be formulated to allow sustained or long-term release. Suppository formulations use traditional binders and carriers and typically contain between 0.1% and 10% of the immunogenic polypeptide. 
 In view of the above information, multivalent vaccines against HGV hepatitis associated agents can be generated which are composed of one or more structural or non-structural viral-agent polypeptide(s). These vaccines can contain, for example, recombinant expressed HGV polypeptides, polypeptides isolated from HGV virions, synthetic polypeptides or assembled epitopes in the form of mosaic polypeptides. In addition, it may be possible to prepare vaccines, which confer protection against HGV hepatitis infection through the use of inactivated HGV. Such inactivation might be achieved by preparation of viral lysates followed by treatment of the lysates with appropriate organic solvents, detergents or formalin. 
 Vaccines may also be prepared from attenuated HGV strains. Such attenuated HGV may be obtained utilizing the above described cell culture and/or animal model systems. Typically, attenuated strains are isolated after multiple passages in vitro or in vivo. Detection of attenuated strains is accomplished by methods known in the art. One method for detecting attenuated HGV is the use of antibody probes against HGV antigens, sequence-specific hybridization probes, or amplification with sequence-specific primers for infected animals or assay of HGV-infected in vitro cultures. 
 Alternatively, or in addition to the above methods, attenuated HGV strains may be constructed based on the genomic information that can be obtained from the information presented in the present specification. Typically, a region of the infectious agent genome that encodes, for example, a polypeptide that is related to viral pathogenesis can be deleted. The deletion should not interfere with viral replication. Further, the recombinant attenuated HGV construct allows the expression of an epitope or epitopes that are capable of giving rise to protective immune responses against the HGV. The desired immune response may include both humeral and cellular immunity. The genome of the attenuated HGV is then used to transform cells and the cells grown under conditions that allow viral replication. Such attenuated strains are useful not only as vaccines, but also as production sources of viral antigens and/or HGV particles. 
 Hybrid particle immunogens that contain HGV epitopes can also be generated. The immunogenicity of HGV epitopes may be enhanced by expressing the epitope in eucaryotic systems (e.g., mammalian or yeast systems) where the epitope is fused or assembled with known particle forming proteins. One such protein is the hepatitis B surface antigen. Recombinant constructs where the HGV epitope is directly linked to coding sequence for the particle forming protein will produce hybrid proteins that are immunogenic with respect to the HGV epitope and the particle forming protein. Alternatively, selected portions of the particle-forming protein coding sequence, which are not involved in particle formation, may be replaced with coding sequences corresponding to HGV epitopes. For example, regions of specific immunoreactivity to the particle-forming protein can be replaced by HGV epitope sequences. 
 The hepatitis B surface antigen has been shown to be expressed and assembled into particles in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiea and in mammalian cells (Valenzuela, et al., 1982 and 1984; Michelle, et al.). These particles have been shown to have enhanced immunoreactivity. Formation of these particles using hybrid proteins, i.e., recombinant constructs with heterologous viral sequences, has been previously disclosed (EPO 175,261, published 26 Mar. 1986). Such hybrid particles containing HGV epitopes may also be useful in vaccine applications. 
 The vaccines of the present invention are administered in dosages compatible with the method of formulation, and in such amounts that will be pharmacologically effective for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. The quantity of immunogen administered depends on the subject being treated, the capacity of the treatment subject's immune system for generation of protective immune response, and the desired level of protection. 
 HGV vaccines of the present invention can be administered in single or multiple doses. Dosage regimens are also determined relative to the treatment subject's needs and tolerances. In addition to the HGV immunogenic polypeptides, vaccine formulations may be administered in conjunction with other immunoregulatory agents. 
 In an additional approach to HGV vaccination, DNA constructs encoding HGV proteins under appropriate regulatory control are introduced directly into mammalian tissue, in vivo. Introduction of such constructs produces "genetic immunization". Similar DNA constructs have been shown to be taken up by cells and the encoded proteins expressed (Wolf, et al.; Ascadi, et al.). Injected DNA does not appear to integrate into host cells chromatin or replicate. This expression gives rise to substantial humoral and cellular immune responses, including protection from in vivo viral challenge in animal systems (Wang, et al., 1993; Ulmer, et al.). In one embodiment, the DNA construct is injected into skeletal muscle following pre-treatment with local anesthetics, such as, bupivicaine hydrochloride with methylparaben in isotonic saline, to facilitate cellular DNA uptake. The injected DNA constructs are taken up by muscle cells and the encoded proteins expressed. 
 Compared to vaccination with soluble viral subunit proteins, genetic immunization has the advantage of authentic in vivo expression of the viral proteins. These viral proteins are expressed in association with host cell histocompatibility antigens, and other proteins, as would occur with natural viral infection. This type of immunization is capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses, in contrast to many soluble subunit protein vaccines. Accordingly, this type of immunization retains many of the beneficial features of live attenuated vaccines, without the use of infectious agents for vaccination and attendant safety concerns. 
 Direct injection of plasmid or other DNA constructs encoding the desired vaccine antigens into in vivo tissues is one delivery means. Other means of delivery of the DNA constructs can be employed as well. These include a variety of lipid-based approaches in which the DNA is packaged using liposomes, cationic lipid reagents or cytofectins (such as, lipofectin). These approaches facilitate in vivo uptake and expression, as summarized by Felgner and Rhodes (1991). Various modifications to these basic approaches include the following: incorporation of peptides, or other moieties, to facilitate (i) targeting to particular cells, (ii) the intracellular disposition of the DNA construct following uptake, or (iii) to facilitate expression. Alternatively, the sequences encoding the desired vaccine antigens may be inserted into a suitable retroviral vector. The resulting recombinant retroviral vector inoculated into the subject for in vivo expression of the vaccine antigen. The antigen then induces the immune responses. As noted above, this approach has been shown to induce both humoral and cellular immunity to viral antigens (Irwin, et al.). 
 Further, the HGV vaccines of the present invention may be administered in combination with other vaccine agents, for example, with other hepatitis vaccines. 
 H. Synthetic Peptides 
 Using the coding sequences of HGV polypeptide, synthetic peptides can be generated which correspond to these polypeptides. Synthetic peptides can be commercially synthesized or prepared using standard methods and apparatus in the art (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). 
 Alternatively, oligonucleotide sequences encoding peptides can be either synthesized directly by standard methods of oligonucleotide synthesis, or, in the case of large coding sequences, synthesized by a series of cloning steps involving a tandem array of multiple oligonucleotide fragments corresponding to the coding sequence (Crea; Yoshio et al.; Eaton et al.). Oligonucleotide coding sequences can be expressed by standard recombinant procedures (Maniatis et al.; Ausubel et al.). 
 V. Characterization of the Viral Genome 
 As shown in Example 4, the HGV genome appears to be an RNA molecule and has the closest sequence similarity to viral sequences that are catagorized in the Flaviviridae family of viruses. This family includes the Flaviviruses, Pestiviruses and an unclassified Genus made up of one member, Hepatitis C virus. The HGV virus does not have significant global (i.e., over the length of the virus) sequence identity with other recognized members of the Flaviviridae--with the exception of the protein motifs discussed below. 
 In general members of the Flaviviridae are enveloped viruses that have densities in sucrose gradients between 1.1 and 1.23 g/ml and are sensitive to heat, organic solvents and detergents. As shown in Example 5, HGV has density characteristics similar to an enveloped Flaviviridae virus (HCV). The integrity of the HGV virion also appears to be sensitive to organic solvents (Example 5). 
 Flaviviridae virions contain a single molecule of linear single-stranded (ss) RNA which also serves as the only mRNA that codes for the viral proteins. The ssRNA molecule is typically between the size of 9 and 12 kilobases long. 
 Viral proteins are derived from one polyprotein precursor that is subsequently processed to the mature viral proteins. Most members of the Flaviviridae do not contain poly(A) tails at their 3' ends. Virions are about 15-20% lipid by weight. 
 Members in the Flaviviridae family have a core protein and two or three membrane-associated proteins. The analogous structural proteins of members in the three genera Flavivirus family show little similarity to one another at the sequence level. The nonstructural proteins contain conserved motifs for RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), helicase, and a serine protease. These short blocks of conserved amino acids or motifs can be detected using computer algorithms known in the art such as "MACAW" (Schuler, et al.). These motifs are presumably related to constraints imposed by substrates processed by these proteins (Koonin and Dolja). The order of these motifs is conserved in all members of the Flaviviridae family. The genome of HGV contains protein motifs found in members of the Flaviviridae family, for example, (i) the helicase gene, (ii) the serine-like protease domain, and (iii) the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) of (see FIG. 5, "GDD" sequence); 
 Sequence information is disclosed herein on several different strains/isolates of HGV. This information can be used by one skilled in the art to isolate new stains/isolates using the techniques of hybridization, primer extension, and RT-PCR as described herein (e.g., using degenerate primers based on the disclosed HGV variant sequences). 
 In the present case, HGV is an new isolate believed to be a member of the family Flaviviridae. Within this virus family, examination of the structural proteins encoded by a virus allows the most definitive determination of whether a viral isolate is a member of a distinct species of virus. Non-structural proteins are most conserved between different species of viruses within a family of virus species. This is believed to be the result of the necessity for preserving enzymatic functions, such as, the following: the proteolytic cleavage of a viral polyprotein, and replication of the RNA genome by viral helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the virus. 
 Examination of several species within any genus of the Flaviviridae family, e.g., the flavivirus genus, demonstrates that the genes for these conserved functions are more highly conserved between species than the structural proteins. Accordingly, one of the major determining factors of whether a virus isolate represents a new species, versus a "variant isolate" of a known species, is a determination of global homology of the structural proteins between known viral species and the new virus isolate. 
 Local homologies found within regions about 200 amino acids or less which are found in non-structural proteins are indeterminant indicators of whether an isolate is a variant or a new species. Typically, virus isolates having global structural protein homologies of less than or about 40% are classified as either different species (viruses) or different genuses. The structural regions of HGV each have homologies lower than 40% compared with any virus described in "GENBANK" (comparisons carried out by methods standard in the art). Accordingly, HGV is considered to be a new species and possibly a new genus of positive strand RNA virus. 
 Another important region that is examined in determining the phylogenetic placement of a viral isolate is the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). These regions are compared between viral isolates. For example, all the members HCV, an unclassified genus of Flaviviridae, have 5' untranslated regions that are greater than about 90% conserved with all other members in the genus. Further, the members of the HCV share 3' untranslated regions between about 24 and about 50 nucleotides long. 
 No significant alignments are found with any virus in "GENBANK" (Ver. 86) when the 5'-untranslated region is used as a query sequence with FASTA on BLASTN. Further, HGV contains a 3' untranslated region that is at least about 250 nucleotides long that also contains little homology to any other known virus. 
 Members of the Flaviviridae family are known to replicate in a wide variety of animals ranging from (i) hematophagous arthropod vectors (ticks and mosquitoes), where they do not cause disease, to (ii) a large range of vertebrate hosts (humans, primates, other mammals, marsupials, and birds). Over 30 members of the Flaviviridae family cause diseases in man, ranging from febrile illness, or rash, to potentially fatal diseases such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or hepatitis. At least 10 members of the Flaviviridae family cause severe and economically important diseases in domestic animals. 
 VI. Utility 
 A. The Invention 
 In one aspect, the invention pertains to polynucleotides derived from a Hepatitis G Virus (HGV) polynucleotide in substantially isolated form. In one embodiment the HGV polynucleotide is characterized by (i) transmission in primates, (ii) serologically distinguishable from hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus, and hepatitis E virus (HEV), and (iii) membership of the virus family Flaviviridae. Polynucleotides of the invention may be comprised of DNA or RNA (or analogs or variants thereof) and may be produced recombinantly, isolated, or synthesized according to methods known in the art. 
 Generally, HGV polynucleotides of the invention will be at least 10 nucleotides in length. In an alternative embodiment, the HGV polynucleotide will be at least 15 nucleotides in length. In still a further alternative embodiment, the HGV polynucleotide will be at least 20 nucleotides in length. 
 In a more specific embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention include cDNA or cDNA complements of the HGV genome. In a more specific embodiment, such a cDNA or cDNA complement will have at least a 40% sequence homology to a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:37, and SEQ ID NO:19, or complements thereof. In yet another embodiment such cDNA's will exhibit at least 55% sequence homology to a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:37, and SEQ ID NO:19, or complements thereof. In more specific embodiments, cDNA or cDNA complement polynucleotides of the invention will have sequences derived from sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:37, and SEQ ID NO:19, or complements thereof. 
 In another general embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention are polynucleotide probes that specifically hybridize with HGV. In yet another general embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention will encode an epitope of HGV. More specifically, such epitope encoding polynucleotides may include sequences derived from SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:19 or SEQ ID NO:37. 
 In another general embodiment, the polynucleotide of the invention includes a contiguous sequence of nucleotides that is capable of selectively hybridizing to an HGV polynucleotide. In this regard, HGV is characterized as a genome comprising an open reading frame (ORF) encoding an amino acid sequence having at least 40% sequence homology to one of the following amino acid sequences: the 2873 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15, the 190 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:38, or the 67 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:20. More particularly, the polynucleotide probe will specifically hybridize with HGV. Such a polynucleotide probe may carry detection labels or other modifications or be fixed to a solid support. 
 DNA polynucleotides as described above may also encode an HGV specifically immunoreactive antigenic determinants.

 B. Immunoassays for HGV 
 One utility for the antigens obtained by the methods of the present invention is their use as diagnostic reagents for the detection of antibodies present in the sera of test subjects infected with HGV hepatitis virus, thereby indicating infection in the subject; for example, 470-20-1 antigen, antigens encoded by SEQ ID NO:14 or its complement, and antigens encoded by portions of either strand of the complete viral sequence. The antigens of the present invention can be used singly, or in combination with each other, in order to detect HGV. The antigens of the present invention may also be coupled with diagnostic assays for other hepatitis agents such as HAV, HBV, HCV, and HEV. 
 In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface-bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention, e.g., the 470-20-1 antigen. After binding with anti-HGV antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing, the reagent is reacted with reporter-labelled anti-human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti-HGV antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labelled antibody, and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically, the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric or calorimetric substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). 
 The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material, such as polymeric beads, dip sticks, 96-well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non-specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein, typically through a free amine group, to a chemically reactive group on the solid support, such as an activated carboxyl, hydroxyl, or aldehyde group. Alternatively, streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen(s). 
 Also forming part of the invention is an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface-bound recombinant HGV antigen (e.g., the 470-20-1 antigen, as above), and a reporter-labelled anti-human antibody for detecting surface-bound anti-HGV antigen antibody. 
 In a second diagnostic configuration, known as a homogeneous assay, antibody binding to a solid support produces some change in the reaction medium which can be directly detected in the medium. Known general types of homogeneous assays proposed heretofore include (a) spin-labelled reporters, where antibody binding to the antigen is detected by a change in reported mobility (broadening of the spin splitting peaks), (b) fluorescent reporters, where binding is detected by a change in fluorescence efficiency or polarization, (c) enzyme reporters, where antibody binding causes enzyme/substrate interactions, and (d) liposome-bound reporters, where binding leads to liposome lysis and release of encapsulated reporter. The adaptation of these methods to the protein antigen of the present invention follows conventional methods for preparing homogeneous assay reagents. 
 In each of the assays described above, the assay method involves reacting the serum from a test individual with the protein antigen and examining the antigen for the presence of bound antibody. The examining may involve attaching a labelled anti-human antibody to the antibody being examined (for example from acute, chronic or convalescent phase) and measuring the amount of reporter bound to the solid support, as in the first method, or may involve observing the effect of antibody binding on a homogeneous assay reagent, as in the second method. 
 A third diagnostic configuration involves use of HGV antibodies capable of detecting HGV-specific antigens. The HGV antigens may be detected, for example, using an antigen capture assay where HGV antigens present in candidate serum samples are reacted with a HGV specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody is bound to a solid substrate and the antigen is then detected by a second, different labelled anti-HGV antibody. Antibodies can be prepared, utilizing the peptides of the present invention, by standard methods. Further, substantially isolated antibodies (essentially free of serum proteins which may affect reactivity) can be generated (e.g., affinity purification (Harlow et al.)). 
 C. Hybridization Assays for HGV 
 One utility for the nucleic acid sequences obtained by the methods of the present invention is their use as diagnostic agents for HGV sequences present in sera, thereby indicating infection in the individual. Primers and/or probes derived from the coding sequences of the present invention, in particular, Clone 470-20-1 and SEQ ID NO:14, can be used singly, or in combination with each other, in order to detect HGV. 
 In one diagnostic configuration, test serum is reacted under PCR or RT-PCR conditions using primers derived from, for example, 470-20-1 sequences. The presence of HGV, in the serum used in the amplification reaction, can be detected by specific amplification of the sequences targeted by the primers. Example 4 describes the use of polymerase chain amplification reactions, employing primers derived from the clones of the present invention, to screen different source material. The results of these amplification reactions demonstrate the ability of primers derived from the clones of the present invention (for example, 470-20-1), to detect homologous sequences by amplification reactions employing a variety of different source templates. The amplification reactions in Example 4 included use of nucleic acids obtained directly from sera as template material. 
 Alternatively, probes can be derived from the HGV sequences of the present invention. These probes can then be labelled and used as hybridization probes against nucleic acids obtained from test serum or tissue samples. The probes can be labelled using a variety of reporter molecules and detected accordingly: for example, radioactive isotopic labelling and chemiluminescent detection reporter systems (Tropix, Bedford, Mass.). 
 Target amplification methods, embodied by the polymerase chain reaction, the self-sustained sequence replication technique  "3SR," (Guatelli, et al.; Gingeras, et al., 1990) also known as "NASBA" (VanGemen, et al.)!, the ligase chain reaction (Barany), strand-displacement amplification  "SDA," (Walker)!, and other techniques, multiply the number of copies of the target sequence. Signal amplification techniques, exemplified by branched-chain DNA probes (Horn and Urdea; Urdea; Urdea, et al.) and the Q-beta replicase method (Cahill, et al.; Lomell, et al.), first bind a specific molecular probe, then replicate all of or part of this probe or in some other manner amplify the probe signal. 
 For the detection of the specific nucleic acid sequences disclosed in the present invention or contiguous sequences in the same or a similar (related) viral genome, amplification and detection methodologies may be employed, as alternatives to amplification by the PCR. A number of such techniques are known to the field of nucleic acid diagnostics (The 1992 San Diego Conference: Genetic Recognition, Clin. Chem. 39(4):705 (1993)). 
 1. Self-Sustained Sequence Replication 
 The Self-Sustained Sequence Replication (3SR) technique results in amplification to a similar magnitude as PCR, but isothermally. Rather than thermal cycle-driven PCR, the 3SR operates as a concerted three-enzyme reaction of a) cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase, b) RNA strand degradation by RNase H, and c) RNA transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. 
 As the entire reaction sequence occurs isothermally (typically at 42° C.), expensive temperature-cycling instrumentation is not required. In the absence of duplex denaturation via heating, organic solvents, or other mechanism, only single-stranded templates (i.e., predominantly RNA) are amplified. 
 Suitable primers for use in 3SR amplification can be selected from the viral sequences of the present invention by those having ordinary skill in the art. For example, for isothermal amplification of viral sequences by the 3SR technique, primer 470-20-1-77F (SEQ ID NO:9) is modified by the addition of the T7 promoter sequence and a preferred T7 transcription initiation site to the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide. This modification results in a suitable 3SR primer T7-470-20-1-77F (SEQ ID NO:9). Primer 470-20-1-211R (SEQ ID NO:10) can be used in these reactions either without modification or T7 promoter. 
 RNA extracted from PNF 2161 is incubated with AMV reverse transcriptase (30 U), RNase H (3 U), T7 RNA polymerase (100 U), in 100 ul reactions containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1 (at room temperature), 15 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 2 mM spermidine HCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, 7 mM each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, and 0.15 uM each primer. Amplification takes place during incubation at 42° C. for 1-2 h. 
 Initially, primer T7-470-20-1-77F anneals to the target RNA, and is extended by AMV reverse transcriptase to form cDNA complementary to the starting RNA strand. Following degradation of the RNA strand by RNase H, reverse transcriptase catalyzes the synthesis of the second strand DNA, resulting in a double-stranded template containing the (double-stranded) T7 promoter sequence. RNA transcription results in production of single-stranded RNA. This RNA then serves to re-enter the cycle for additional rounds of amplification, finally resulting in a pool of high-concentration product RNA. The product is predominantly single-stranded RNA of the same strand as the primer containing the T7 promoter (T7-470-20-1-77F), with much smaller amounts of cDNA. 
 Alternatively, the other primer (470-20-1-211R) may contain the T7 promoter, or both primers may contain the promoter, resulting in production of both strands of RNA as products of the reaction. Products of the 3SR reaction may be detected, characterized, or quantitated by standard techniques for the analysis of RNA (e.g., Northern blots, RNA slot or dot blots, direct gel electrophoresis with RNA-staining dyes). Further, the products may be detected by methods making use of biotin-avidin affinity interactions or specific hybridizations of nucleic acid probes. 
 In one technique for rapid and specific analysis of 3SR products, solution hybridization of the product to radiolabelled oligonucleotide 470-20-1-152R (SEQ ID NO:21) is followed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This assay (a gel mobility shift-type assay) results in the detection of specific probe-product hybrid as a slower-moving band than the band corresponding to unhybridized oligonucleotide. 
 2. Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) 
 As another example of a detection system, the HGV sequence may form the basis for design of ligase chain reaction (LCR) primers. LCR makes use of the nick-closing activity of DNA ligase to join two immediately adjacent oligonucleotides possessing adjacent 5'-phosphate ("donor" oligo) and 3'-hydroxyl ("acceptor" oligo) terminii. The property of DNA ligase to join only fully complementary ends in a template-dependent way, leads to a high degree of specificity, in that ligation will not occur unless the terminii to be linked are perfectly matched in sequence to the target strand. 
 As an alternative to PCR, with some advantages in terms of specificity for discrimination of single base mismatches between primer and target nucleic acid, the LCR may be used to detect or "type" strains of virus possessing homology to HGV sequences. These techniques are suitable for assessing the presence of specific mutations when such base changes are known to confer drug resistance (e.g., Larder and Kemp; Gingeras, et al., 1991). 
 In the presence of template-complementary donor and acceptor oligonucleotides and oligonucleotides complementary to the donor and acceptor, exponential amplification by LCR is possible. In this embodiment, each round of ligation generates additional template for subsequent rounds, in a cyclic reaction. 
 For example, primer 470-20-1-211R (SEQ ID NO:10), an adjacent oligonucleotide (B, SEQ ID NO:22) and cognate oligos (211R', SEQ ID NO:23, and B', SEQ ID NO:24), can be used to perform LCR amplification of the sequence of this invention. Reverse transcription is first performed by standard methods to generate cDNA, which is then amplified in reactions containing 0.1-1 μM each of the four LCR primers, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3 (room temperature), 25 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM NAD+, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 5 Units of DNA ligase (Ampligase, Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wis., or other commercial supplier of thermostable DNA ligase), in 25 ul reactions. 
 Thermal cycling is performed at 94° C. for 1 min. 30 s; 94° C. for 1 min., 65° C. for 2 min., repeated for 25-40 cycles. Specificity of product synthesis depends on primer-template match at the 3'-terminal position. Products are detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by ethidium bromide staining; alternatively, one of the acceptor oligos (211R' or B) is 5'-radiolabelled for visualization by autoradiography following gel electrophoresis. 
 Alternatively, a donor oligo is 3'-end-labelled with a specific bindable moiety (e.g., biotin), and the acceptor is 5'-labelled with a specific detectable group (e.g., a fluorescent dye), for solid phase capture and detection. 
 3. Methods for Analysis of Amplified DNA 
 Numerous techniques have been described for the analysis of amplified DNA. Several such techniques are advantageous for high-throughput applications, where gel electrophoresis is impractical, for example, rapid and high-resolution HPLC techniques (Katz and Dong). However, in general, methods for infectious disease organism screening using nucleic acid probes involve a separate post-amplification hybridization step in order to assure requisite specificity for pathogen detection. 
 One such detection embodiment is an affinity-based hybrid capture technique (Holodniy, et al.). In this embodiment the PCR is conducted with one biotinylated primer. Following amplification, the double-stranded product is denatured then hybridized to a peroxidase-labelled probe complementary to the strand having incorporated the biotinylated primer. The hybridized product is then incubated in a buffer which is in contact with an avidin (or streptavidin) coated surface (e.g., membrane filter, microwell, latex or paramagnetic beads). 
 The mass of coated solid phase which contacts the volume of PCR product to be analyzed by this method must contain sufficient biotin-binding sites to capture essentially all of the free biotinylated primer, as well as the much lower concentration of biotinylated PCR product. Following three to four washes of the solid phase, bound hybridized product is detected by incubation with o-phenylenediamine in citrate buffer containing hydrogen peroxide. 
 Alternatively, capture may be mediated by probe-coated surfaces, followed by affinity-based detection via the biotinylated primer and an avidin-reporter enzyme conjugate (Whetsell, et al.). 
 4. Additional Methods 
 Viral sequences of the present invention may also form the basis for a signal amplification approach to detection, using branched-chain DNA probes. Branched-chain probes (Horn and Urdea; Urdea) have been described for detection and quantification of rare RNA and DNA sequences (Urdea, et al.). In this method, an oligonucleotide probe (RNA, DNA, or nucleic acid analogue) is synthesized with a sequence complementary to the target RNA or DNA. The probe also contains a unique branching sequence or sequences not complementary to the target RNA or DNA. 
 This unique sequence constitutes a target for hybridization of branched secondary detector probes, each of which contains one or more other unique sequences, serving as targets for tertiary probes. At each branch point in the signal amplification pathway, a different unique sequence directs hybridization of secondary, tertiary, etc., detection probes. The last probe in the series typically is linked to an enzyme useful for detection (e.g., alkaline phosphatase). The sequential hybridization of primers eventually results in the buildup of a highly-branched structure, the arms of which terminate in enzyme-linked probes. 
 Enzymatic turnover provides a final amplification, and the choice of highly sensitive chemiluminescent substrates (e.g., LumiPhos, Lumigen, Detroit, Mich., as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase labels) results in exquisite sensitivity, on the order of 10,000 molecules or less of original target sequence per assay. In such a detection method, amplification depends only on molecular hybridization, rather than enzymatic mechanisms, and is thus far less susceptible to inhibitory substances in clinical specimens than, for example, PCR. Thus, this detection method allows the use of crude techniques for nucleic acid release in test samples, without extensive purification before assay. 
 Amplification for sensitive detection of the viral sequences of the present invention may also be accomplished by the Q-β replicase technique (Cahill, et al.; Lomell, et al.; Pritchard, et al.). In this method, a specific probe is designed to be complementary to the target sequence. This probe is then inserted by standard molecular cloning techniques into the sequence of the replicatable RNA from Q-β phage. Insertion into a specific region of the replicon does not prevent replication by Q-β replicase. 
 Following molecular hybridization, and several cycles of washing, the replicase is added and amplification of the probe RNA ensues. "Reversible target capture" is one known technique for reducing the potential background from replication of unhybridized probes (Morrissey, et al.). Amplified replicons are detectable by standard molecular hybridization techniques employing DNA, RNA or nucleic acid analogue probes. 
 Additional methods for amplification and detection of rare DNA or RNA sequences are known in the literature and preferred to the PCR for some applications in the field of molecular diagnostics. These alternative techniques may form the basis for detection, characterization (e.g., sequence diversity existing as multiple related strains of the sequence described herein, genotypic changes characteristic of drug resistance), or quantification of the sequence disclosed in the present invention. 
 Also forming part of the invention are assay systems or kits for carrying out the amplification/hybridization assay methods just described. Such kits generally include either specific primers for use in amplification reactions or hybridization probes. 
 D. Therapeutic Uses 
 As discussed above, the HGV antigens of the present invention can be used in vaccine preparation. 
 Further, antibodies generated against the polypeptide antigens of the present invention can be used for passive immunotherapy or passive immunoprophylaxis. The antibodies can be administered in amounts similar to those used for other therapeutic administrations of antibody. For example, pooled gamma globulin is administered at 0.02-0.1 ml/lb body weight during the early incubation of other viral diseases such as rabies, measles and hepatitis B to interfere with establishment of infection. Thus, antibodies reactive with the HGV antigens can be passively administered alone or in conjunction with another anti-viral agent to a host infected with HGV to enhance the ability of the host to deal with the infection. 
 The HGV sequences disclosed herein identify HGV as a member of the Flaviviridae family (see above). The Flaviviridae are classified into 3 genera, flaviviruses, petstiviruses, and the hepatitis C virus genera (Francki, et al.). All Flaviviridae possess a positive strand RNA genome of 9.0-12 kb in length which encodes a single long polypeptide of 3000-4000 amino acids. This polypeptide is proteolytically cleaved into approximately 10 proteins, including, a viral capsid protein, viral envelope protein(s), and a minimum of 5 non-structural proteins (NS). The non-structural proteins include a chymotrypsin like serine protease, RNA helicase (NS3), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5). The NS3 protein of Flaviviridae is required for proteolytic cleavage of the viral polypeptide. The NS5 protein is required for replication of the viral genome (Chambers, et al., 1990a). 
 Additionally, several cellular proteins have been identified as being involved in the replication of the Flaviviridae. For example, cellular signal peptidase enzyme may be required to cleave the viral polypeptide at several cleavage sites, to allow for expression of the viral protease (Hijikata, et al.). 
 Inhibitors which prevent these proteins from carrying out their required functions in flavivirus replication may also have therapeutic value at treating infection with HGV. Finally cytokines or other polypeptides which are known to have antiviral activity and/or modulate the human immune system may be efficacious at treating HGV infection. 
 One compound known to inhibit Flaviviridae RNA dependent RNA polymerases, which by analogy may be expected to inhibit the activity of the NS5 protein of HGV, is the nucleotide analogue 1-B-D-ribofuranosyl-1-2,4-triazole, 3-carboxamide, also known as ribavirin (Patterson, et al.). The method of action of ribavirin is thought to involve depletion of intercellular guanine pools and interference with the capping of viral RNAs (Patterson et al.). 
 In individuals infected with HCV, significant reductions in viral titer and in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT--an indicator enzyme for liver dysfunction) were observed while ribavirin was administered (Reichard, et al.; Di Bisceglie, et al., 1992). Ribavirin appears to have broad efficacy for treating Flaviviridae infections, accordingly, beneficial results are expected after administration of ribavirin to individuals suffering from HGV derived liver disease. 
 Another class of compounds known to be efficacious for treating Flaviviridae infections include the cytokines interferon α, interferon β, and interferon γ (Baron, et al.; Gutterman). Interferons are thought to act as antivirals by both (i) inducing the expression of cellular proteins that interfere with the replication and translation of viral RNAs, and (ii) by the activation of components of the human cellular immune system (Baron, et al.). The interferons have broad applicability to the treatment of viral infections including infection with HBV, HDV, and HCV (Gutterman; Farci, et al.). In particular, multiple studies have indicated that the interferons, either alone or in combination with other antiviral therapies, are effective at treating infection with hepatitis C virus (Di Bisceglie, et al., 1989; Kakumu, et al.). Due to both the apparent hepatotropic nature of HGV and its classification in the family Flaviviridae, HGV infection may be expected to respond to similar interferon therapy. 
 Still another class of compounds with potent anti-viral activity are inhibitors of viral proteases (Krausslich, et al.). All Flaviviridae encode a chymotrypsin-like serine protease which is required to cleave multiple sites of the genome polypeptide at multiple sites in the non-structural region. The amino acid residues that make up the catalytic site of this protease are well described and include a Histidine, an Aspartic acid, and a Serine residue (Grakoui, et al.). Furthermore studies of the flavivirus, Yellow Fever Virus have indicated that mutation of the Serine residue of the active site inhibits viral replication (Chambers, et al., 1990b). 
 Inhibitors of the HGV NS3 protein can be designed to mimic the transition state of enzymatic cleavage. Alternatively, such inhibitors may be isolated by mass screening of previously synthesized compounds. The activity of putative HGV NS3 proteinase inhibitors can be determined through the use of in vitro transcription/translation systems, which are widely used in Flaviviridae research (Hijikata, et al.; Grakoui, et al.). 
 Alternatively, the HGV genome can be cloned into a suitable vector for eukaryotic protein expression, such a bacculovirus or vaccinia, and the efficacy of the compounds can be determined in tissue culture systems (Grakoui, et al.). Similar approaches have been employed successfully to obtain potent inhibitors of the HIV protease (Vacca, et al.; Roberts, et al.). 
 Another approach to treating disease caused by infection with the HGV relies on the synthesis of antisense oligonucleotides (Tonkinson and Stein) or oligonucleotide analogs which encode portions of the sequences of HGV disclosed in the present invention. As is true for all Flaviviridae, it would be expected that the genome of HGV is a positive strand RNA molecule of 9-12 kb in size. The single stranded nature of the viral genome should make HGV exquisitely sensitive to antisense oligonucleotides. Possible target sequences which might be employed to inhibit viral replication include the 5' untranslated region of HGV, the ribosome binding site of HGV or other sequences which would interfere with the translation of the HGV genome. 
 Antisense oligonucleotides can be synthesized using commercially available synthesizers. Preferably the oligonucleotides are synthesized using phosphorodithioate backbones which have the advantage of being resistant to nuclease cleavage (Marshall & Caruthers). Additionally other oligonucleotide analogues, such as those having a uncharged or amide type backbone (Egholm, et al.) may be employed. These oligonucleotides are commercially available (Biosearch, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) and advantageous in that their lack of charge allows them to cross biological membranes, which are typically resist the passage of charged macromolecules. 
 Oligonucleotides (or analogs thereof) for antisense applications are typically greater than 8 nucleotides in length to facilitate hybridization to a target sequence within the HGV genome. Upon hybridization of, for example, DNA oligomers to viral RNA target sequences, the hybridization complex can be degraded by a cellular enzyme such as RNAse H. The reduction in HGV templates then lessens the severity of HGV associated disease. 
 The usefulness and efficacy of the above described therapeutic methods can be evaluated in vitro, using the cell systems described above, and in vivo, using the animal model systems described above. 
 The following examples illustrate, but in no way are intended to limit the present invention. 
 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Synthetic oligonucleotide linkers and primers were prepared using commercially available automated oligonucleotide synthesizers. Alternatively, custom designed synthetic oligonucleotides may be purchased from commercial suppliers. 
 Standard molecular biology and cloning techniques were performed essentially as previously described in Ausubel, et al., Sambrook, et al., and Maniatis, et al. 
 Common manipulations relevant to employing antisera and/or antibodies for screening and detection of immunoreactive protein antigens were performed essentially as described (Harlow, et al.). Similarly ELISA and Western blot assays for the detection of anti viral antibodies were performed either as described by their manufacturer (Abbott, N. Chicago, Ill., Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore) or using standard techniques known in the art (Harlow, et al). 
 EXAMPLES 
 Example 1 
 CONSTRUCTION OF PNF2161 cDNA LIBRARIES 
 A. Isolation of RNA from Sera 
 One milliliter of undiluted PNF 2161 serum was precipitated by the addition of PEG (MW 6,000) to 8% and centrifugation at 12K, for 15 minutes in a microfuge, at 4° C. RNA was extracted from the resulting serum pellet essentially as described by Chomczynski. 
 The pellet was treated with a solution containing 4M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 0.18% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% sarcosyl. The treated pellet was extracted several times with acidic phenol-chloroform, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. This solution was held at -70° C. for approximately 10 minutes and then spun in a microfuge at 4° C. for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of DEPC-treated (diethyl pyrocarbonate) water, and 10 μl of 3M NaOAc, pH=5.2, two volumes of 100% ethanol and one volume of 100% isopropanol were added to the solution. The solution was held at -70° C. for at least 10 minutes. The RNA pellet was recovered by centrifugation in a microfuge at 12,000×g for 15 minutes at 5° C. The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and dried under vacuum. 
 B. Synthesis of cDNA 
 (i) First Strand Synthesis 
 The synthesis of cDNA molecules was accomplished as follows. The above described RNA preparations were transcribed into cDNA, according to the method of Gubler et al. using random nucleotide hexamer primers (cDNA Synthesis Kit, BMB, Indianapolis, Ind. or GIBCO/BRL). 
 After the second-strand cDNA synthesis, T4 DNA polymerase was added to the mixture to maximize the number of blunt-ends of cDNA molecules. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform isoamyl alcohol. 
 The cDNA was precipitated by the addition of two volumes of 100% ethanol and chilling at -70° C. for 15 minutes. The cDNA was collected by centrifugation, the pellet washed with 70% ethanol and dried under vacuum. 
 C. Amplication of the Double Stranded cDNA Molecules 
 The cDNA pellet was resuspended in 12 μl distilled water. To the resuspended cDNA molecules the following components were added: 5 μl phosphorylated linkers (Linker AB, a double strand linker comprised of SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2, where SEQ ID NO:2 is in a 3' to 5' orientation relative to SEQ ID NO:1--as a partially complementary sequence to SEQ ID NO:1), 2  μl  10× ligation buffer (0.66M Tris.Cl pH=7.6, 50 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM DTT, 10 mM ATP) and 1 μl T4 DNA ligase (0.3 to 0.6 Weiss Units). Typically, the cDNA and linker were mixed at a 1:100 ratio. The reaction was incubated at 14° C. overnight. The following morning the reaction was incubated at 70° C. for three minutes to inactivate the ligase. 
 To 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1.5 mM MgCl 2  and 50 mM KCl (Buffer A) was added about 1 μl of the linker-ligated cDNA preparation, 2 μM of a primer having the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:1, 200 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 2.5 units of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase). The reaction mixture was heated to 94° C. for 30 sec for denaturation, allowed to cool to 50° C. for 30 sec for primer annealing, and then heated to 72° C. for 0.5-3 minutes to allow for primer extension by Taq polymerase. The amplification reaction, involving successive heating, cooling, and polymerase reaction, was repeated an additional 25-40 times with the aid of a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler (Mullis; Mullis, et al.; Reyes, et al., 1991; Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn.). 
 After the amplification reactions, the solution was then phenol/chloroform, chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extracted and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol. The resulting amplified cDNA pellets were resuspended in 20 μl TE (pH=7.5). 
 D. Cloning of the cDNA into Lambda Vectors 
 The linkers used in the construction of the cDNAs contained an EcoRI site which allowed for direct insertion of the amplified cDNAs into lambda gt11 vectors (Promega, Madison, Wis. or Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Lambda vectors were purchased from the manufacturer (Promega) which were already digested with EcoRI and treated with alkaline phosphatase, to remove the 5' phosphate and prevent self-ligation of the vector. 
 The EcoRI-digested cDNA preparations were ligated into lambda gt11 (Promega). The conditions of the ligation reactions were as follows: 1 μl vector DNA (Promega, 0.5 mg/ml); 0.5 or 3 μl of the PCR amplified insert cDNA; 0.5 μl 10×ligation buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl, pH=7.8; 0.1M MgCl 2  ; 0.2M DTT; 10 mM ATP; 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)), 0.5 μl T4 DNA ligase (0.3 to 0.6 Weiss units) and distilled water to a final reaction volume of 5 μl. 
 The ligation reactions were incubated at 14° C. overnight (12-18 hours). The ligated cDNA was packaged by standard procedures using a lambda DNA packaging system ("GIGAPAK", Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.), and then plated at various dilutions to determine the titer. A standard X-gal blue/white assay was used to determine recombinant frequency of the libraries (Miller; Maniatis et al.). 
 Percent recombination in each library was also determined as follows. A number of random clones were selected and corresponding phage DNA isolated. Polymerase chain reaction (Mullis; Mullis, et al.) was then performed using isolated phage DNA as template and lambda DNA sequences, derived from lambda sequences flanking the EcoRI insert site for the cDNA molecules, as primers. The presence or absence of insert was evident from gel analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products. 
 The cDNA-insert phage libraries generated from serum sample PNF 2161 was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, Md. 20852, and has been assigned the deposit designation ATCC 75268 (PNF 2161 cDNA source). 
 Example 2 
 IMMUNOSCREENING OF RECOMBINANT LIBRARIES 
 The lambda gt11 libraries generated in Example 1 were immunoscreened for the production of antigens recognizable by the PNF 2161 serum from which the libraries were generated. The phage were plated for plaque formation using the Escherichia coli bacterial plating strain E. coli KM392. Alternatively, E. coli Y1090R (Promega, Madison, Wis.) may be used. 
 The fusion proteins expressed by the lambda gt11 clones were screened with serum antibodies essentially as described by Ausubel, et al. 
 Each library was plated at approximately 2×10 4  phages per 150 mm plate. Plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters overnight. Filters were washed with TBS (10 mM, Tris pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl), blocked with AIB (TBS buffer with 1% gelatin) and incubated with a primary antibody diluted 100 times in AIB. 
 After washing with TBS, filters were incubated with a second antibody, goat-anti-human IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Reactive plaques were developed with a substrate (for example, BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate), with NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium salt (Sigma)). Positive areas from the primary screening were replated and immunoscreened until pure plaques were obtained. 
 Example 3 
 SCREENING OF THE PNF 2161 LIBRARY 
 The cDNA library of PNF 2161 in lambda gt11 was screened, as described in Example 2, with PNF 2161 sera. The results of the screening are presented in Table 1.

The isolated nucleic acid sequence without the SISPA cloning linkers is presented as SEQ ID NO:19 (protein SEQ ID NO:20). 
 Example 4 
 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE IMMUNOREACTIVE 470-20-1 CLONE 
 A. Southern Blot Analysis of Immunoreactive Clones 
 The inserts of immunoreactive clones were screened for their ability to hybridize to the following control DNA sources: normal human peripheral blood lymphocyte (purchased from Stanford University Blood Bank, Stanford, Calif.) DNA, and Escherichia coli KM392 genomic DNA (Ausubel, et al.; Maniatis, et al.; Sambrook, et al.). Ten micrograms of human lymphocyte DNA and 2 micrograms of E. coli genomic DNA were digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The restriction digestion products were electrophoretically fractionated on an agarose gel (Ausubel, et al.) and transferred to nylon or nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, N.H.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 
 Probes from the immunoreactive clones were prepared as follows. Each clone was amplified using primers corresponding to lambda gt11 sequences that flank the EcoRI cloning site of the gt11 vector. Amplification was carried out by polymerase chain reactions utilizing each immunoreactive clone as template. The resulting amplification products were digested with EcoRI, the amplified fragments gel purified and eluted from the gel (Ausubel, et al.). The resulting amplified fragments, derived from the immunoreactive clones, were then random prime labelled using a commercially available kit (BMB) employing  32  P-dNTPs. 
 The random primed probes were then hybridized to the above-prepared nylon membrane to test for hybridization of the insert sequences to the control DNAs. The 470-20-1 insert did not hybridize with any of the control DNAs. 
 As positive hybridization controls, a probe derivative from a human C-kappa gene fragment (Hieter) was used as single gene copy control for human DNA and a E. coli polymerase gene fragment was similarly used for E. coli DNA. 
 B. Genomic PCR 
 PCR detection was developed first to verify exogenicity with respect to several genomic DNAs which could have been inadvertently cloned during library construction, then to test for the presence of the cloned sequence in the cloning source and related specimen materials. Several different types of specimens, including SISPA-amplified nucleic acids and nucleic acids extracted from the primary source, and nucleic acids extracted from related source materials (e.g., from animal passage studies), were tested. 
 The term "genomic PCR" refers to testing for the presence of specific sequences in genomic DNA from relevant organisms. For example, a genomic PCR for a Mystax-derived clone would include genomic DNAs as follows: 
 1. human DNA (1 μg/rxn.) 
 2. Mystax DNA (0.1-1 μg/rxn.) 
 3. E. coli (10-100 ng/rxn.) 
 4. yeast (10-100 ng/rxn.) 
 Human and Mystax DNAs are tested, as the immediate and ultimate source for the agent. E. coli genomic DNA, as a frequent contaminant of commercial enzyme preparations, is tested. Yeast is also tested, as a ubiquitous organism, whose DNA can contaminate reagents and thus, be cloned. 
 In addition, a negative control (i.e., buffer or water only), and positive controls to include approximately 10 5  c/rxn., are also amplified. 
 Amplification conditions vary, as may be determined for individual sequences, but follow closely the following standard PCR protocol: PCR was performed in reactions containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.75 MM MgCl 2 , 1.0 uM each primer, 200 uM each DATP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 300 μM dUTP, 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.2 units uracil-N-glycosylase per 100 ul reaction. Cycling was for at least 1 minute at 94° C., followed by 30 to 40 repetitions of denaturation (92°-94° C. for 15 seconds), annealing (55°-56° C. for 30 seconds), and extension (72° C. for 30 seconds). PCR reagents were assembled, and amplification reactions were constituted, in a specially-designated laboratory maintained free of amplified DNA. 
 As a further barrier to contamination by amplified sequences and thus compromise of the test by "false positives," the PCR was performed with dUTP replacing TTP, in order to render the amplified sequences biochemically distinguishable from native DNA. To enzymatically render unamplifiable any contaminating PCR product, the enzyme uracil-N-glycosylase was included in all genomic PCR reactions. Upon conclusion of thermal cycling, the reactions were held at 72° C. to prevent renaturation of uracil-N-glycosylase and possible degradation of amplified U-containing sequences. 
 A "HOT START PCR" was performed, using standard techniques ("AMPLIWAX", Perkin-Elmer Biotechnology; alternatively, manual techniques were used), in order to make the above general protocol more robust for amplification of diverse sequences, which ideally require different amplification conditions for maximal sensitivity and specificity. 
 Detection of amplified DNA was performed by hybridization to specific oligonucleotide probes located internal to the two PCR primer sequences and having no or minimal overlap with the primers. In some cases, direct visualization of electrophoresed PCR products was performed, using ethidium bromide fluorescence, but probe hybridization was in each case also performed, to help ensure discrimination between specific and non-specific amplification products. Hybridization to radiolabelled probes in solution was followed by electrophoresis in 8-15% polyacrylamide gels (as appropriate to the size of the amplified sequence) and autoradiography. 
 Clone 470-20-1 was tested by genomic PCR, against human, E. coli, and yeast DNAS. No specific sequence was detected in negative control reactions, nor in any genomic DNA which was tested, and 10 5  copies of DNA/reaction resulted in a readily-detectable signal. This sensitivity (i.e., 10 5  /reaction) is adequate for detection of single-copy human sequences in reactions containing 1 ug total DNA, representing the DNA from approximately 1.5×10 5  cells. 
 C. Direct Serum PCR 
 Serum or other cloning source or related source materials were directly tested by PCR using primers from selected cloned sequences. In these experiments, HGV viral particles were directly precipitated from sera with polyethylene glycol (PEG), or, in the case of PNF and certain other sera, were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. For purification of RNA, the pelleted materials were dissolved in guanidinium thiocyanate and extracted by the acid guanidinium phenol technique (Chomczynski, et al.). 
 Alternatively, a modification of this method afforded through and implemented by the use of commercially available reagents, e.g., "TRIREAGENT" (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, Ohio) or "TRIZOL" (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.), and associated protocols was used to isolate RNA. In addition, RNA suitable for PCR analysis was isolated directly from serum or other fluids containing virus, without prior concentration or pelleting of virus particles, through the use of "PURESCRIPT" reagents and protocols (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). 
 Isolated DNA was used directly as a template for the PCR. RNA was reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase (Gibco/BRL), and the cDNA product was then used as a template for subsequent PCR amplification. 
 In the case of 470-20-1, nucleic acid from the equivalent of 20-50 ul of PNF serum was used as the input template into each RT-PCR or PCR reaction. Primers were designed based on the 470-20-1 sequence, as follows: 470-20-1-77F (SEQ ID NO:9) and 470-20-1-211R (SEQ ID NO:10). Reverse transcription was performed using MMLV-RT (Gibco/BRL) and random hexamers (Promega) by incubation at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes, 42° C. for 15 minutes, and 99° C. for 5 minutes, with rapid cooling to 4° C. The synthesized cDNA was amplified directly, without purification, by PCR, in reactions containing 1.75 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2-1 μM each primer, 200 uM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 2.5-5.0 units Taq DNA polymerase ("AMPLITAQ", Perkin-Elmer) per 100 ul reaction. Cycling was for at least one minute at 94° C., followed by 40-45 repetitions of denaturation (94° C. for 15 seconds for 10 cycles; 92° C. or 94° C. for 15 seconds for the succeeding cycles), annealing (55° C. for 30 seconds), and extension (72° C. for 30 seconds), in the "GENEAMP SYSTEM 9600" thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) or comparable cycling conditions in other thermal cyclers (Perkin-Elmer; MJ Research, Watertown, Mass.). 
 Positive controls consisted of (i) previously amplified PCR product whose concentration was estimated using the Hoechst 33258 fluroescence assay, (ii) purified plasmid DNA containing the DNA sequence of interest, or (iii) purified RNA transcripts derived from plasmid clones in which the DNA sequence of interest is disposed under the transcriptional control of phage RNA promoters such as T7, T3, or SP6 and RNA prepared through the use of commercially available in vitro transcription kits. In addition, an aliquot of positive control DNA corresponding to approximately 10-100 copies/rxn. can be spiked into reactions containing nucleic acids extracted from the cloning source specimen, as a control for the presence of inhibitors of DNA amplification reactions. Each separate extract was tested with at least one positive control. 
 Specific products were detected by hybridization to a specific oligonucleotide probe 470-20-1-152F (SEQ ID NO:16), for confirmation of specificity. Hybridization of 10 ul of PCR product was performed in solution in 20 ul reactions containing approximately 1×10 6  cpm of  32  P-labelled 470-20-1-152F. Specific hybrids were detected following electrophoretic separation from unhybridized oligo in polyacrylamide gels, and autoradiography. 
 In addition to PNF, extracted nucleic acids from normal serum was also reverse transcribed and amplified, using the "serum PCR" protocol sequence. No signal was detected in normal human serum. The specific signal in PNF serum was reproducibly detected in multiple extracts, with the 470-20-1 specific primers. 
 D. Amplification from SISPA Uncloned Nucleic Acids 
 SISPA (Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification) amplified cDNA was used as templates (Example 1). Sequence-specific primers designed from selected cloned sequences were used to amplify DNA fragments of interest from the templates. Typically, the templates were the SISPA-amplified samples used in the cloning manipulations. For example, amplification primers 470-20-1-77F (SEQ ID NO:9) and 470-20-1-211R (SEQ ID NO:10) were selected from the clone 470-20-1 sequence (SEQ ID NO:3). These primers were used in amplification reactions with the SISPA-amplified PNF2161 cDNA as a template. 
 The identity of the amplified DNA fragments were confirmed by (i) hybridization with the specific oligonucleotide probe 470-20-1-152F (SEQ ID NO:16), designed based on the 470-20-1 sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) and/or (ii) size. The probe used for DNA blot detection was labelled with digoxygenin using terminal transferase according to the manufacturer's recommendations (BMB). Hybridization to the amplified DNA was then performed using either Southern blot or liquid hybridization (Kumar, et al., 1989) analyses. 
 Positive control DNA used in the amplification reactions was previously amplified PCR product whose concentration was estimated by the Hoechst 33258 fluorescence assay, or, alternatively, purified plasmid DNA containing the cloned inserts of interest. 
 The 470-20-1 specific signal was detected in cDNA amplified by PCR from SISPA-amplified PNF2161. Negative control reactions were nonreactive, and positive control DNA templates were detected. 
 E. Amplification from Liver RNA Samples 
 RNA was prepared from liver biopsy material following the methods of Cathal, et al., wherein tissue was extracted in 5M guanidine thiocyanate followed by direct precipitation of RNA by 4M LiCl. After washing of the RNA pellet with 2M LiCl, residual contaminating protein was removed by extraction with phenol:chloroform and the RNA recovered by ethanol precipitation. 
 The 470-20-1 specific primers were also used in amplification reactions with the following RNA sources as substrate: normal mystax liver RNA, normal tamarin (Sanguinus labiatus) liver RNA, and MY131 liver RNA. MY131 is a mystax that was inoculated intravenously with 1 ml of PNF 2161 plasma. There were obvious elevations of a liver enzyme (SCID) and histological evidence of an apparent viral infection. The histological correlation was most obvious in the liver of MY131, whose liver was obtained at or near the peak of SCID activity.  Mystax  131 liver RNA did not give amplified products with the non-coding primers (SEQ ID NO:7 and SEQ ID NO:8) of HCV. 
 The amplification reactions were carried out in duplicate for two experiments. The results of these amplification reactions are presented in Table 2.

 These results demonstrate the 470-20-1 sequences are present in the parent serum sample (PNF 2161) and in a liver RNA sample from a passage animal of the PNF 2161 sample (MY131). However, both control RNAs were negative for the presence of 470-20-1 sequences. 
 F. Screening of a Serum Panel for HGV Sequences by Polymerase Chain Reaction using RNA Templates 
 1. High-ALT Donors 
 The disease association between HGV and liver disease was assessed by polymerase chain reaction screening, using HGV specific primers, of sera from hepatitis patients and from blood donors with abnormal liver function. The latter consisted of serum from blood donations with serum ALT levels greater than 45 International Units per ml. 
 A serum panel consisting of 152 total sera was selected. The following sera were selected for the serum panel: 104 high-ALT sera from screened blood donations at the Stanford University Blood Bank (SUBB); 34 N-(ABCDE) hepatitis sera from northern California, Egypt, and Peru; and 14 sera from other donors suspected of having liver disease and/or hepatitis virus infection. The negative controls for the panel were as follows: 9 highly-screened blood donors (SUBB) notable for the absence of risk factors for viral infections ("supernormal" sera, e.g., β-negative, Rh-negative; negative for HIV, known hepatitis agents, and CMV; whose multiple previous blood donations had been transfused without causing disease); and 2 random blood donors. These sera were assayed for the presence of HGV specific sequences by RT-PCR using the 470-20-1 primers 77F (SEQ ID NO:9) and 211R (SEQ ID NO:10). 
 RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed essentially as described in Example 4C, except that the primer 470-20-1-211R was 5'-biotinylated to facilitate rapid screening of amplified products by a method involving hybridization in solution, followed by affinity capture of hybridized probe using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Methods for the analysis of nucleic acids by hybridization to specific labelled probes with capture of the hybridized sequences through affinity interactions are well known in the art of nucleic acid analysis. 
 Depending on the amount of serum available for testing, RNA from 30 to 50 μl of serum was used per RT/PCR reaction. Each serum was tested in duplicate, with positive controls corresponding to 10, 100, or 1000 copies of RNA transcript per reaction and with appropriate negative (buffer) controls. No negative controls were reactive, and at least 10 copies per reaction were detectable in each PCR run. Indeterminate results were defined as specific hybridizing signal being present in only one of two duplicate reactions. 
 Efficient, highly sensitive analysis of the products from the amplification analysis of this serum panel was performed using an instrument specifically designed for affinity-based hybrid capture using electrochemiluminscent oligonucleotide probes (QPCR System 5000™, Perkin-Elmer). Assays utilizing the QPCR 5000™ have been described (DiCesare, et al; Wages, et al). 
 The products of each reaction were assayed by hybridization to probe 470-20-1-152F (5'-end-labelled with an electrochemiluminescent ruthenium chelate), and measurement using the "QPCR 5000." Based on a cutoff of the sum of the mean and three times the standard deviation of negative controls in a given amplification run, a total of 34 possible positives were selected for confirmatory testing. 
 The 34 samples were analyzed by solution hybridization and electrophoresis (Example 4C). Out of these 34 samples, 6 sera (i.e., 6/152) were shown to have specific hybridizing sequences in duplicate reactions. Of these six samples, three were strongly reactive by comparison with positive controls: one High-ALT serum from SUBB, and two N-(ABCDE) sera from Egypt. 
 A second blood sample was obtained from the highly positive SUBB serum donor one year after the initial sample was taken. The second serum sample was confirmed to be HGV positive by the PCR methods described above. This result confirms persistant infection by HGV in a human. The serum was designated "JC." Further, the serum donor was HCV negative (determined by seroreactivity tests and PCR) and antibody negative for HAV and HBV. 
 In addition, a third N-(ABCDE) serum from Egypt, a northern California blood donor with N-(ABCDE) hepatitis, and a N-(ABCDE) hepatitis serum, were also shown to be weakly positive by this method. Two other sera gave indeterminate results, defined as the presence of specific sequences in one of two amplification reactions. 
 Subsequent PCR analysis of replicate serum aliquots from these HGV-positive and indeterminate sera resulted in HGV-positive results in 6 of 8 sera tested and indeterminate results in the remaining 2 sera. 
 A second primer set was used for the confirmation of HGV positive samples. This primer set (GV57-4512MF, SEQ ID NO:121, and GV57-4657MR, SEQ ID NO:122) for diagnostic amplification, was selected from a conserved region of HGV derived from the putative NS5 coding region. An approximately 2.2 kb fragment was amplified from each of 5 separate HGV isolates. The primers used for the amplification reactions were 470EXT4-2189R (SEQ ID NO:119) and 470EXT4-29F (SEQ ID NO:120). The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced and the sequences aligned. Highly conserved regions were identified from the alignment and optimal primer sequences were designed incorporating mixed base synthesis at those positions that remained divergent throughout the five sequences. The resulting NS5 primers were as follows: GV57-4512MF, SEQ ID NO:121, and GV57-4657MR, SEQ ID NO:122. These primers were used to amplify a diagnostic fragment of 165 bp from test samples. 
 An internal probe sequence, GV22dc-89MF (SEQ ID NO:123) was derived from another highly conserved region for detection of the specifically amplified product. The probe is also of sufficient length to allow for detection of minimally divergent HGV sequences under lowered stringency conditions. 
 Analysis of specimens for the presence of the diagnostic NS5 sequence followed the same conditions for sample preparation, amplification, and liquid hybridization as described for the 470-20-1 primers (Example 4C). The concordance of results for sera samples analyzed by PCR using both the 470-20-1 and NS5 primer pairs are shown in Table 3.

 Further PCR analyses of additional aliquots obtained from the 8 sera identified above as being HGV-positive were carried out using the 470-20-1 primer set (SEQ ID NO:9 and SEQ ID NO:10) and the NS5 primer set. In these assays, the HGV PCR analyses gave consistently positive results in 5 of the 8 sera. These results are presented in Table 4. 
 In contrast, none of the two random donors or nine highly-screened "supernormal" sera was positive in either set of PCR analysis. 
 These results reinforce the disease association between HGV and liver disease.

 Further testing of sera from High-ALT donors has yielded the following results. A total of 495 sera have been tested, in addition to the initial panel of 104 sera described above. Of these 495 specimens, 6 were identified as HGV positive using the primer pair 470-20-1-77F (SEQ ID NO:9) and 470-20-1-211R (SEQ ID NO:10). These six sera have the following HCV profiles: R25342, HCV negative; R17749, HCV positive; J53171, HCV positive, HBV positive; J54406, HCV negative; R08074, HCV negative; and X31049, HCV negative. Positive scores are based on repeated reactivity in at least 2 separate reactions. R25342 was tested and confirmed positive by PCR using the NS5 primer pair. Accordingly, a detection rate of approximately 1.2% has been observed (7 of 599 tested). 
 Freshly-obtained plasma samples from blood donors with elevated ALT were also obtained from SUBB, the Peninsula Blood Bank (Burlingame, Calif.), and the New York Blood Center (New York, N.Y.), for testing for HGV RNA by PCR (470-20-1 primer pair). Of 214 total donations which were tested, a total of 5 (approximately 2.3%) were HGV RNA positive. These five sera have the following HCV profiles: T55806, HCV positive; T55875, HCV negative; T56633, HCV negative; R38730, HCV negative; and 3831781, HCV negative. Subsequent donations from two of these donors, T55806 and T55875, were also HGV RNA positive. T55806, T55875 and T56633 were tested and confirmed positive by PCR using the NS5 primer pair. 
 2. Screening of Accepted Blood Donors 
 To assess the prevalence of HGV in the normal blood donor population, serum was collected from screened blood donors for transfusion at SUBB. A total of 968 specimens, representing 769 unique donors, was tested for HGV RNA. The samples were screened by PCR using the 470-20-1 primer pair. 
 A total of 16 sera were identified as having detectable HGV RNA. Of these, 6 represent duplicates from 3 donors, such that a total of 13 unique donors of 769 tested were HGV positive by RNA PCR. All positive samples were tested and confirmed positive by PCR using the NS5 primer pair. These donors were characterized by normal ALT levels, as well as otherwise normal serology. Accordingly, approximately 1.7% of the sera tested in the normal blood donor population are HGV positive. Therefore, the presence of HGV was detected in both accepted and rejected blood donors. 
 3. Specimens from Various Geographic Locales 
 The presence of HGV infection in populations of hepatitis patients from geographically widespread sources was assessed by PCR. The PCR reactions were carried out essentially as described in Example 4C using the 470-20-1 PCR primer pairs. Serum samples from Egypt, Greece, Australia (see Example 4F-4), Peru, England, Italy, Germany, South Korea, United States and Japan were tested. HGV RNA was detectable in subsets of all populations tested. 
 4. Post-Transfusion Associated HGV Infection and Parenteral Transmission 
 HGV RNA was detected in several post-transfusion hepatitis cases (those of Japanese and European origin were included in Example 4F-3). For 4 total cases, one from Japan, two from the U.S. and one from Australia, multiple time-points were assayed for the presence of HGV RNA. For 3 of these cases, (i) pre-transfusion samples were available to estabish previous HGV status of the patient, and (ii) samples were available from individual blood donors to those three cases, to establish donor HGV status. 
 The first case was a Japanese patient transfused on Dec. 2, 1980. Following the transfusion the patient developed Non-B Non-C hepatitis. A total of 5 sera from this patient were tested for HGV RNA by PCR using the 470-20-1 primer pair. HGV RNA was detectable from about 2 weeks to about 8 months following transfusion. A sample taken greater than 1 year post-transfusion was indeterminate (i.e., positive in one duplicate reaction only). No pre-transfusion sample was available for testing. 
 Cases BIZ and STO (Tables 5 and 6, respectively) were from a prospectively-followed heart surgery study (Alter, et al., 1989) conducted at the NIH. For each of these patients, pre-transfusion sera were available and were determined to be negative for HGV RNA by PCR using the 470-20-1 primer pair. BIZ tested positive for HGV RNA from day one post-transfusion to week 198 post-transfusion. of 9 total blood donors to BIZ, 2 out of 8 tested were found to be HGV positive. STO tested positive for HGV RNA from  week  5 post-transfusion through week 92 post-transfusion.

 The fourth case, also prospectively-defined, was a cardiac surgery patient who participated in a post-transfusion hepatitis study conducted in Sydney, Australia. The patient (PA-124), having no other identifiable risk factors, received 14 units of blood during surgery (4 units packed red cells, 10 units of platelets). Of these 14 units one was HGV positive; the other 13 were HGV negative. HBV and HCV serologies of the 14 blood donors were negative with the exception of a reactive HCV EIA (first generation test). No other HCV test confirmed the positive finding. 
 In patient PA-124 (Table 7), serum ALT was elevated beginning with a sample taken two weeks post-operation, and was observed to be at least 10 times the pre-operation level for a period of 14 weeks. PCR results for HCV performed on pre-transfusion, 4 week, and 8 week sera from PA-124, were all negative. Serum from this patient was tested for HGV RNA using the 470-20-1 PCR primers. A pre-transfusion sample was negative for HGV RNA. Positive results were demonstrated following transfusion, coinciding with and succeeding the ALT elevation. The presence of HGV RNA was detected out to one year post-transfusion. These data support the conclusion that HGV may be parenterally transmitted.

 Among 100 multiply-transfused sickle cell anemia and thalassemia patients, 19 (19%) were found to have detectable serum HGV RNA. Similarly, 9 of 49 hemophilia patients (18%) were HGV positive with 470-20-1 and NS5 primers. Significantly, 15 of 54 (28%) IVDU were found to be PCR positive for HGV RNA. Infection rates in these parenteral risk groups (18-28%) appear to be higher than rates in blood donors with elevated ALT (1-2%). These results reinforce the significance of the parenteral route for HGV transmission. 
 5. PCR Screening of Selected Hepatitis Disease Groups 
 Sera from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, HBV infection or HCV infection were tested for the presence of HGV using polymerase chain reaction (data presented in Table 8). In each of sets of specimens from patients with liver disease, HGV positive specimens were demonstrated (with the exception of specimens from patients with autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, both conditions not thought to be exclusively associated with an infectious agent). 
 As shown in the collections of sera from post-transfusion hepatitis patients (Example 4F-4), HGV infection is established during acute hepatitis, but circulating viral RNA continues to be detected during chronic infection for periods of time measured in months to years. 
 Approximately 10-20% co-infection rates were observed in patients with HBV and HCV infection. HGV infection is thus shown to be associated with hepatitis with or without co-infection with other hepatitis viruses. Co-infection may reflect similar risk factors and routes of transmission for these hepatitis viruses. As noted above, there is a higher prevalence of HGV in parenteral risk groups, such as hemophiliacs, IVDU's, and multiply transfused anemia patients (compared with other hepatitis risk groups). 
 6. Persistent Infection by HGV in Humans 
 Post-transfusion hepatitis cases BIZ, STO, and PA-124 were show to have PCR-detectable viral RNA up to 3.8, 1.8, and 1.0 years, respectively, following transfusion and acute infection. Additional serum samples were obtained from donor JC (Example 4F-1), one year and 1.5 years following the initial positive sample. These follow-up serum samples were also HGV positive. Additional sera from other high-ALT donors (T55806, T55875, R25342), obtained several months following the serum sample in which HGV infection was originally detected, were also positive. Similarly, when HGV infection was established in an experimental primate (CH1356, Example 4H), HGV RNA was detected over 1.5 years following innoculation. These data establish persistent HGV viremia in humans and experimental primates. 
 G. Amplification of Long Fragments from Patient RNA for Sequencing 
 PCR primers were designed to amplify several informative regions of the HGV genome in order to obtain sequence information on varied HGV isolates. The primers 470EXT4-2189R (SEQ ID NO:119) and 470EXT4-29F (SEQ ID NO:120) were designed to amplify a 2.2 kb fragment that contained the original 470-20-1 sequence. RNA from samples was reverse-transcribed using "SUPERSCRIPT II" reverse transcriptase (Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.). The resulting cDNA was amplified using reagents for efficient long-range PCR ("XL PCR BUFFERS" and "rTth-XL", Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Div., Foster City, Calif.). 
 The amplification reaction was considered to be positive if a band of the correct size on agarose gel electrophoresis was detected. The sample was confirmed as positive by preliminary DNA sequencing of the amplification product. The following sera samples tested positive for HGV RNA by this amplification method: PNF2161; R10291 (JC); and specimens from each of the North American, Egyptian, and Japanese groups. However, no positive samples were detected from the Peruvian sera. 
 Successful amplification from a variety of HGV-positive specimens provides confirmation of the results obtained by PCR amplification using the 470-20-1 primer pair discussed above. Failure to obtain amplification, however, may reflect poor RNA quality or low copy number or local sequence differences among isolates such that the selected primer sets would not function universally. 
 In order to obtain sequence information from the putative 5'-untranslated region of the HGV genome, primers were designed to amplify fragments from the 5'-untranslated region (based on the HGV PNF 2161-variant). The two fragments were defined by the following primer sets: FV94-22F (SEQ ID NO:124) and FV94-724R (SEQ ID NO:125), yielding a 728 base pair fragment; and FV94-94F (SEQ ID NO:126) and FV94-912R (SEQ ID NO:127), yielding an 847 base pair fragment. 
 The conditions just described to promote efficient long-range PCR were used. Products were obtained from most of the samples tested, providing additional confirmation of the presence of HGV RNA in the samples. 
 H. Infectivity of HGV in Primates 
 Two chimpanzees (designated CH1323 and CH1356), six cynomolgus monkeys (CY143, CY8904, CY8908, CY8912, CY8917, and CH8918), and six Mystax (MY29, MY131, MY98, MY187, MY229, MY254) subjects were inoculated with PNF 2161. Pre-inoculation and post-inoculation sera were monitored for ALT and for the presence of HGV RNA sequences (as determined by PCR screening--described above). 
 One cynomologous monkey (CY8904) showed a positive RNA PCR result (39 days post-inoculation) and one indeterminant result from a total of 17 seperate blood draws. In one chimpanzee, designated CH1356, was sustained viremia observed by RT-PCR. As shown in Table 9, no significant ALT elevation was observed, and circulating virus was detected only at time points considerably after inoculation. Viremia was observed at and following 118 days post-inoculation. Suggestive reactivity was also observed in the first post-inoculation time-point (8 days), which may indicate residual inoculum.

 The data presented above indicate that HGV infection was persistent up to 1.7 years in an experimental primate. 
 I. Characterization of the Viral Genome 
 The isolation of 470-20-1 from a cDNA library (Example 1) suggests that the viral genome detected in PNF 2161 is RNA. Further experiments to confirm the identity of the HGV viral genome as RNA include the following. 
 Selective degradation of either RNA or DNA (e.g., by DNase-free RNase or RNase-free DNase) in the original cloning source followed by amplification with HGV specific primers and detection of the amplification products serves to distinguish RNA from DNA templates. 
 An alternative method makes use of amplification reactions (nucleic acids from the original cloning source as template and HGV specific primers) that employ (i) a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, in the absence of any RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcripase) in the reactions, and (ii) a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in the reactions. In this method, if the HGV genome is DNA or has a DNA intermediate, then amplified product is detected in both types of amplification reactions. If the HGV genome is only RNA, the amplified product is detected in only the reverse transcriptase-containing reactions. 
 Total nucleic acid (i.e., DNA or RNA) was extracted from PNF 2161, using proteinase K and SDS followed by phenol extraction, as described in Example 4C. The purified nucleic acid was then amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) where either (i) the PCR was preceded by a reverse transcription step, or (ii) the reverse transcription step was omitted. Amplification was reproducibly obtained only when the PCR reactions were preceded by reverse transcription. As a control, DNA templates were successfully amplified in separate reactions. These results demonstrate that the nature of the HGV viral genome is RNA. 
 The strand of the cloned, double-stranded DNA sequence that was originally present in PNF 2161 may be deduced by various means, including the following. Northern or dot blotting of the unamplified genomic RNA from an infected source serum can be performed, followed by hybridization of duplicate blots to probes corresponding to each strand of the cloned sequence. Alternatively, single-stranded cDNA probes isolated from M13 vectors (Messing), or multiple strand-specific oligonucleotide probes are used for added sensitivity. If the source serum contains single-stranded RNA, only one probe (i.e., sequences from one strand of the 470-20-1 clones) yield a signal, under appropriate conditions of hybridization stringency. If the source serum contains double-stranded RNA, both strand-probes will yield a signal. 
 The polymerase chain reaction, prefaced by reverse transcription using one or the other specific primer, represents a much more sensitive alternative to Northern blotting. Genomic RNA extracted from purified virions present in PNF 2161 serum is used as the input template into each RT/PCR. Rather than cDNA synthesis with random hexamers, HGV sequence-specific primers were used. One cDNA synthesis reaction was performed with a primer complementary to one strand of the cloned sequence (e.g., 470-20-1-77F); a second cDNA synthesis reaction was also performed using a primer derived from the opposite strand (e.g., 470-20-1-211R). 
 The resulting first strand cDNA was amplified in using two HGV specific primers. Controls were included for successful amplification by PCR (e.g., DNA controls). RNA transcripts from each strand of the cloned sequence was also used, to control also for the reverse transcription efficiency obtained when using the specific primers which are described. 
 Specific products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. DNA controls (i.e., double-stranded DNA controls for the PCR amplifcation) were successfully amplified regardless of the primer used for reverse transcription. Single-stranded RNA transcripts (i.e., controls for reverse transcription efficiency and strand specificity) were amplified only when the opposite-strand primer was used for cDNA synthesis. 
 The PNF-derived HGV polynucleotide gave rise to a specific amplified product only when the primer 470-20-1-211R was used for reverse transcription, thus indicating that the original HGV polynucleotide sequence present in the serum is complementary to 470-20-1-211R and is likely a single-strand RNA.

 SUCROSE DENSITY GRADIENT SEPARATION OF PNF2161 
 A. Banding of PNF-2161 Agent 
 A continuous gradient of 10-60% sucrose ("ULTRAPURE", Gibco/BRL) in TNE (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) was prepared using a gradient maker from Hoefer Scientific (San Francisco, Calif.). Approximately 12.5 ml of the gradient was overlaid with 0.4 ml of PNF serum which had been stored at -70° C, rapidly thawed at 37° C., then diluted in TNE. 
 The gradient was then centrifuged in the SW40 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 40,000 rpm (approximately 200,000×g at r av ) at 4° C. for approximately 18 hours. Fractions of volume approximately 0.6 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube, and 0.5 ml was weighed directly into the ultracentrifuge tube, for calculation of density.

 *"+" and "-" scores were initially based on 40cycle PCR. In order to     
 distinguish "+", "++", "+++", and "++++", fractions giving initial       
 positive scores (7-18) were amplified with 30 cycles of PCR.             
 
 The putative viral particles were then pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in the Ti70.1 rotor (approximately 110,000×g) at 4° C. for 2 hours, and RNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium phenol technique ("TRI REAGENT", Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, Ohio), and alcohol-precipitated using glycogen as a carrier to improve recovery. The purified nucleic acid was dissolved in an RNase-free buffer containing 2 mM DTT and 1 U/μl recombinant RNasin. 
 Analysis of the gradient fractions by RNA PCR (Example 4C) showed a distinct peak in the 470-20-1 specific signal, localized in fractions of density ranging from 1.126 to 1.068 g/ml (Table 10). The 470-20-1 signal was thus shown, under these conditions, to form a discrete band, consistent with the expected behavior of a viral particle in a sucrose gradient. 
 B. Relative Viral Particle Densities 
 PNF 2161 has been demonstrated to be co-infected with HCV (see above). In order to compare the properties of the 470-20-1 viral particle to other known hepatitis viral particles, the serum PNF 2161 and a sample of purified Hepatitis A Virus were layered on a sucrose gradient (as described above). Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected, pelleted and the RNA extracted. The isolated RNA from each fraction was subjected to amplification reactions (PCR) using HAV (SEQ ID NO:5; SEQ ID NO:6), HCV (SEQ ID NO:7; SEQ ID NO:8) and 470-20-1 (SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10) specific primers. 
 Product bands were identified by electrophoretic separation of the amplification reactions on agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 11.

 These results suggest that 470-20-1 particles are more similar to HCV particles than to HAV. 
 Further, serum PNF 2161 and HAV particles were treated with chloroform before sucrose gradient centrifugation. The results of these experiments suggest that 470-20-1 agent may be an enveloped virus since it has more similar properties to an enveloped Flaviviridae member (HCV) than a non-enveloped virus (HAV). 
 Example 6 
 GENERATION OF 470-20-1 EXTENSION CLONES 
 A. Anchor PCR 
 RNA was extracted directly from PNF2161 serum as described in Example 1. The RNA was passed through a "CHROMA SPIN" 100 gel filtration column (Clontech) to remove small molecular weight impurities. cDNA was synthesized using a BMB cDNA synthesis kit. After cDNA synthesis, the PNF cDNA was ligated to a 50 to 100 fold excess of KL-1/KL-2 SISPA or JML-A/JML-B linkers (SEQ ID NO:11/SEQ ID NO:12, and SEQ ID NO:17/SEQ ID NO:18, respectively) and amplified for 35 cycles using either the primer KL-1 or the primer JML-A. 
 The 470 extension clones were generated by anchored PCR of a 1 μl aliquot from a 10 μl ligation reaction containing EcoRI digested (dephosphorylated) lambda gt11 arms (1 μg) and EcoRI digested PNF cDNA (0.2 μg). PCR amplification (40 cycles) of the ligation reaction was carried out using the lambda gt11 reverse primer (SEQ ID NO:13) in combination with either 470-20-77F (SEQ ID NO:9) or 470-20-1-211R (SEQ ID NO:10). All primer concentrations for PCR were 0.2 μM. 
 The amplification products (9 μl/100 μl) were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, blotted to "NYTRAN" (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, N.H.), and probed with a digoxygenin labelled oligonucleotide probe specific for 470-20-1. The digoxygenin labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations using terminal transferase (BMB). Bands that hybridized were gel-purified, cloned into the "TA CLONING VECTOR pCR II" (Invitrogen), and sequenced. 
 Numerous clones having both 5' and 3' extensions to 470-20-1 were identified. All sequences are based on a consensus sequence from the sequencing of at least two independent isolates. This Anchor PCR approach was repeated in a similar manner to obtain further 5' and 3' extension sequences. These PCR amplification reactions were carried out using the lambda gt11 reverse primer (SEQ ID NO:13) in combination with HGV specific primers derived from sequences obtained from previous extension clones. The substrate for these reactions was unpackaged PNF 2161 2-cDNA source DNA. 
 Sequencing was carried out using "DYEDEOXY TERMINATOR CYCLE SEQUENCING" (a modification of the procedure of Sanger, et al.) on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencing system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Sequence data is presented in the Sequence Listing. Sequences were compared with "GEN-BANK", EMBL database and dbEST (National Library of Medicine) sequences at both nucleic acid and amino acid levels. Search programs FASTA, BLASTP, BLASTN and BLASTX (Altschul, et al.) indicated that these sequences were novel as both nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. 
 Individual clones obtained using a selected primer pair were aligned to yield a consensus sequence. The series of consensus sequences used to construct the sequence for the HGV-PNF 2161 variant was as follows: 4E3, SEQ ID NO:26; 3E3, SEQ ID NO:27; 2E5, SEQ ID NO:28; 1E5, SEQ ID NO:29; 4E5, SEQ ID NO:30; 3E5, SEQ ID NO:31; 2E3, SEQ ID NO:32; 1E3, SEQ ID NO:33; 4E5-20, SEQ ID NO:34; 5E3, SEQ ID NO:39; 6E3, SEQ ID NO:40; 7E3, SEQ ID NO:42; 5E5, SEQ ID NO:43; 6E5(44F), SEQ ID NO:44; 8E3, SEQ ID NO:98; 9E3, SEQ ID NO:109; 10E3, SEQ ID NO:110; 11E3, SEQ ID NO:116; 12E3, SEQ ID NO:118; 5'-end, SEQ ID NO:175; and 3'-END, SEQ ID NO:167. 
 The individual consensus sequences were aligned, overlapping sequences identified and a consensus sequence for the HGV-PNF 2161 variant was determined. This consensus sequence was compared with the sequences obtained for four other HGV variants: JC (SEQ ID NO:182), BG34 (SEQ ID NO:176), T55806 (SEQ ID NO:178), and EB20-2 (SEQ ID NO:180). 
 The consensus sequence of the HGV-PNF 2161 variant consists of 9391 base pairs presented as SEQ ID NO:14. This sequence represents a continuous open reading frame (SEQ ID NO:15). A Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot of the polyprotein is presented as FIG. 11. 
 The relationship between the original 470-20-1 clone and the sequences obtained by extension is shown schematically in FIG. 1. As seen in the figure, the DNA strand having opposite polarity to the protein coding sequence of 470-20-1 comprising a long continuous open reading frame. 
 The amino acid sequence of HGV was compared against the sequences of all viral sequence in the PIR database (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.) of protein sequences. The comparison was carried out using the "SSEARCH" program of the "FASTA" suite of programs version 1.7 (Pearson, et al.). Regions of local sequence similarities were found between the HGV sequences and two viruses in the Flaviviridae family of viruses. The similarity alignments are presented in FIGS. 5A and 5B. 
 Present in these alignments are motifs for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) of these viruses. Conserved RDRP amino acid motifs are indicated in FIGS. 5A and 5B by stars and uppercase, bold letters (Koonin and Dolja). These alignments demonstrate that this portion of the HGV coding sequence correspond to RDRP. This alignment data combined with the data concerning the RNA genome of HGV supports the placement of HGV as a member of the Flaviviridae family. 
 The global amino acid sequence identities of the HGV polyprotein (SEQ ID NO:15) with HoCV (Hog Cholera Virus) and HCV are 17.1% and 25.5%, respectively. Such levels of global sequence identity demonstrates that HGV is a separate viral entity from both HoCV and HCV. To illustrate, in two members of the Flaviviridae family of viruses BVDV (Bovine Diarrhea Virus) and HCV, 16.2% of the amino acids can be globally aligned with HGV. 
 Members within a genus generally show high homology when aligned globally, for example, BVDV vs. HoCV show 71.2% identity. Various members (variants) of the un-named genus of which HCV is a member are between 65% and 100% identical when globally aligned. 
 B. Race PCR: 5' End Cloning 
 Clones representing the 5'-end of the HGV genome were obtained by a modified Anchor PCR approach that utilized RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) technology. The RACE method was originally described by Frohman, et al., (1988) and Belyausky, et al., (1989). Briefly, the 5'-end clones of HGV were obtained as follows. 
 First-strand cDNA synthesis was primed using random hexamers and synthesis was carried out using either "SUPERSCRIPT II" or "rTth" reverse transcriptase (GIBCO/BRL). After first-strand synthesis, the RNA template was degraded by base hydrolysis (NaOH). The cDNA sample was neutralized by the addition of acetic acid and purified by absorption to a glass matrix support ("GENO-BIND," Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.). Following purification, the cDNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and washed twice with 80% ethanol. 
 The originally described RACE method was modified as follows. A single-stranded oligonucleotide anchor (SEQ ID NO:174) (Clontech) was ligated to the 3' end of the first-strand cDNA using T4 RNA ligase in the presence of cobalt chloride. The oligonucleotide anchor was obtained from the manufacturer with two modifications: (i) the 3'-end of the anchor was modified with an amino group which prevents concatamer formation, and (ii) the 5'-end contains a phosphate group which allows ligation to the first-strand cDNA. 
 After ligation of the anchor, the cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using several HGV-specific primers in combination with a primer complementary to the anchor sequence (AP primer, SEQ ID NO:134). The resulting amplification products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to filters and hybridized with a nested, HGV-specific oligonucleotide probe. Bands that hybridized to the HGV-probe were isolated, cloned into "pCR-II" (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) and sequenced. 
 C. HGV 3' End Cloning 
 Clones representing the 3'-end of the HGV genome were obtained by a modified anchored RT-PCR method. Briefly, poly A polymerase (GIBCO/BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) was used to catalyze the addition of a poly(A) tail to PNF 2161 RNA prior to cDNA synthesis. The poly(A) addition was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following purification of the poly(A) modified RNA, reverse transcription with "SUPERSCRIPT II" (GIBCO/BRL) was carried out using primer GV-5446IRT (SEQ ID NO:184). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primer set: GV59-5446F (SEQ ID NO:171) and GV-5446IR (SEQ ID NO:172). 
 After amplification, the products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to filters and hybridized with a digoxigenin-labelled oligonucleotide probe (E5-7-PRB, SEQ ID NO:173). Products that hybridized with the oligonucleotide were isolated, purified, cloned into "pCR-II" and sequenced. The two clones isolated by this method were MP3-3 (SEQ ID NO:168) and MP3-7 (SEQ ID NO:169). 
 Example 7 
 ISOLATION OF 470-20-1 FUSION PROTEIN 
 A. Expression and Purification of 470-20-1/Glutathione-S-Transferase Fusion Protein 
 Expression of a glutathione-S-transferase (sj26) fused protein containing the 470-20-1 peptide was achieved as follows. A 237 base pair insert (containing 17 nucleotides of SISPA linkers on both sides) corresponding to the original lambda gt11 470-20-1 clone was isolated from the lambda gt11 470-20-1 clone by polymerase chain reaction using primers gt11 F(SEQ ID NO:25) and gt11 R(SEQ ID NO:13) followed by Eco RI digestion. 
 The insert was cloned into a modified pGEX vector, pGEX MOV. pGEX MOV encodes sj26 protein fused with six histidines at the carboxy terminal end (sj26his). The 470-20-1 polypeptide coding sequences were introduced into the vector at a cloning site located downstream of sj26his coding sequence in the vector. Thus, the 470-20-1 polypeptide is expressed as sj26his/470-20-1 fusion protein. The sj26 protein and six histidine region of the fusion protein allow the affinity purification of the fusion protein by dual chromatographic methods employing glutathione-conjugated beads (Smith, D. B., et al.) and immobilized metal ion beads (Hochula; Porath). 
 E. coli strain W3110 (ATCC catalogue number 27352) was transformed with pGEX MOV and PGEX MOV containing 470-20-1 insert. Sj26his protein and 470-20-1 fusion protein were induced by the addition of 2 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The fusion proteins were purified either by glutathione-affinity chromatography or by immobilized metal ion chromatography (IMAC) according to the published methods (Smith, D. B., et al.; Porath) in conjunction with conventional ion-exchange chromatography. 
 The purified 470-20-1 fusion protein was immunoreactive with PNF 2161. However, purified sj26his protein was not immunoreactive with PNF 2161, indicating the presence of specific immunoreaction between the 470-20-1 peptide and PNF 2161. 
 B. Isolation of 470-20-1/b-Galactosidase Fusion Protein 
 KM392 lysogens infected either with lambda phage gt11 or with gt11/470-20-1 are incubated in 32° C. until the culture reaches to an O.D. of 0.4. Then the culture is incubated in a 43° C. water bath for 15 minutes to induce gt11 peptide synthesis, and further incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. Bacterial cells are pelleted and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2% "TRITON X-100" and 1% aprotinin). Bacterial lysates are clarified by centrifugation (10K, for 10 minutes, Sorvall JA20 rotor) and the clarified lysates are incubated with  Sepharose  4B beads conjugated with anti-β-galactosidase (Promega). 
 Binding and elution of β-galactosidase fusion proteins are performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Typically binding of the proteins and washing of the column are done with lysis buffer. Bound proteins are eluted with 0.1M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer,  pH  10. The purified 470-20-1/b-galactosidase protein is immunoreactive with both PNF2161 and anti-b-galactosidase antibody. However, β-galactosidase, expressed by gt11 lysogen and purified, is not immunoreactive with PNF2161 but immunoreactive with anti-β-galactosidase antibody. 
 Example 8 
 Purification of the 470-20-1 Fusion Protein and Preparation of Anti-470-20-1 Antibody 
 A. Glutathione Affinity Purification 
 Materials included 50 ml glutathione affinity matrix reduced form (Sigma),  XK  26/30 Pharmacia column, 2.5×10 cm Bio-Rad "ECONO-COLUMN" (Richmond, Calif.), Gilson (Middleton, Wis.) HPLC, DTT (Sigma), glutathione reduced form (Sigma), urea, and sodium phosphate dibasic. 
 The following solutions were used in purification of the fusion protein: 
 Buffer A: phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.4, and 
 Buffer B: 50 mM Tris Ph 8.5, 8 mM glutathione, (reduced form glutathione) 
 Strip buffer: 8M urea, 100 mM Tris pH 8.8, 10 mM glutathione, 1.5 NaCl. 
 E. coli carrying the plasmid pGEX MOV containing 470-20-1 insert, were grown in a fermentor (20 liters). The bacteria were collected and lysed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) using a micro-fluidizer. Unless otherwise noted, all of the following procedures were carried out at 4° C. 
 The crude lysate was prepared for loading by placing lysed bacteria into "OAKRIDGE" tubes and spinning at 20K rpms (40 k×g) in a Beckman model JA-20 rotor. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.4 μm filter and then through a 0.2 μm filter. 
 The 2.5×10 cm "ECONO-COLUMN" was packed with the glutathione affinity matrix that was swelled in PBS for two hours at room temperature. The column was brought into equilibrium by washing with 4 bed volumes of PBS. 
 The column was loaded with the crude lysate at a flow rate of 8 ml per minute. Subsequently, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of PBS at the same flow rate. 
 The column was eluted by setting the flow rate to 0.75-1 ml/min. and introducing Buffer B. Buffer B was pumped through the column for 5 column volumes and two-minute fractions were collected. An exemplary elution profile is shown in FIG. 2. The content and purity of the proteins present in the fractions were assessed by standard SDS PAGE (FIG. 3). The 470-20-1/sj26his fusion protein was identified based on its predicted molecular weight and its immunoreactivity to PNF 2161 serum. For further manipulations, the protein can be isolated from fractions containing the fusion protein or from the gel by extraction of gel regions containing the fusion protein. 
 B. Purification of Clone 470-20-1 Fusion Protein by Anion Exchange 
 Solutions include the following: 
 Buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 4M urea, 10 mM DTT); 
 Buffer B (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 4M urea, 10 mM DTT, 2.0M NaCl); and 
 Strip Buffer (8M urea, 100 mM Tris pH 8.8, 10 mM glutathione, 1.5 NaCl). 
 Crude lysate (or other protein source, such as pooled fractions from above) was loaded onto "HIGH-Q-50" (Biorad, Richmond, Calif.) column at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min. The column was then washed with Buffer A for 5 column volumes at a flow rate of 4.0 ml/min. 
 After these washes, a gradient was started and ran from Buffer A to Buffer B in 15 column volumes. The gradient then stepped to 100% Buffer B for one column volume. An exemplary gradient is shown in FIG. 4A. Fractions were collected every 10 minutes. Purity of the 470-20-1/sj26his fusion protein was assessed by standard SDS-PAGE (FIGS. 4B and 4C) and relevant fractions were pooled (approximately fractions 34 through 37, FIG. 4C). 
 C. Preparation of Anti-470-20-1 Antibody 
 The purified 470-20-1/sj26his fusion protein is injected subcutaneously in Freund's adjuvant in a rabbit. Approximately 1 mg of fusion protein is injected at    days    0 and 21, and rabbit serum is typically collected at 6 and 8 weeks. 
 A second rabbit is similarly immunized with purified sj26his protein. 
 Minilysates are prepared from bacteria expressing the 470-20-1/sj26his fusion protein, sj26his protein, and β-galactosidase/470-20-1 fusion protein. The lysates are fractionated on a gel and transfered to a membrane. Separate Western blots are performed using the sera from the two rabbits. 
 Serum from the animal immunized with 470-20-1 fusion protein is immunoreactive with all sj26his fusion protein in minilysates of IPTG induced E. coli W3110 that are transformed either with PGEX MOV or with pGEX MOV containing 470-20-1 insert. This serum is also immunoreactive with the fusion protein in the minilysate from the 470-20-1 lambda gt11 construct. 
 The second rabbit serum is immunoreactive with both sj26his and 470-20-1/sj26his fusion proteins in the minilysates. This serum is not expected to immunoreactive with 470-20-1/β-galactosidase fusion protein in the minilysate from the 470-20-1 lambda gt11 construct. None of the sera are expected to be immunoreactive with β-galactosidase. 
 Anti-470-20-1 antibody present in the sera from the animal immunized with the fusion protein is purified by affinity chromatography (using the 470-20-1 ligand). 
 Alternatively, the fusion protein can be cleaved to provide the 470-20-1 antigen free of the sj-26 protein sequences. The 470-20-1 antigen alone is then used to generate antibodies as described above.

 Rabbit Anti-Peptide Sera 
 Peptides were designed to cover the entire HGV sequence, in particular, to cover each of the functional groups in the non-structural and structural genes. Peptides were synthesized commercially by conventional techniques. Representative peptides are presented in Table 12.

 The peptides were coupled to KLH. Using rabbits as host, the conjugated peptides were injected subcutaneously at multiple sites. Anti-peptide rabbit serum were generated by a commercial facility. A two-week immunization protocol was used with bleeds taken at alternate weeks. 
 Rabbit anti-peptide sera were shown to be peptide specific and to have high titer. Rabbit anti-peptide sera also recognize corresponding recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli and baculovirus. Antibody endpoint titers range from 1:50,000 dilution to 1:625,000 dilution. Rabbit anti-peptide 7 (NS4a) had low end point titers of only 1:1,000. Accordingly, rabbit anti-serum to the NS4a protein expressed in, for example, the baculovirus system may be a more useful reagent. 
 Rabbit anti-peptide sera are useful for immunoprecipitating corresponding HGV proteins expressed, for example, in baculovirus and vaccinia. Rabbit anti-peptide sera are also useful as capture antibody in EIAs to detect HGV antigen. Rabbit anti-peptide sera are further useful in the characterization of the HGV proteins.

 SEROLOGY 
 A. Western Blot Analysis of Sera Panels 
 The 470-20-1 fusion antigen (described above) was used to screen panels of sera. Many of the panels were of human sera derived both from individuals suffering from hepatitis and uninfected controls. 
 Affinity purified 470-20-1 fusion antigen (Example 8) was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE at 2 μg/cm. The gel was run for two hours at 200V. The antigen was transfered from the gel to a nitrocellulose filter. 
 The membrane was then blocked for 2 hours using a solution of 1% bovine serum albumin, 3% normal goat serum, 0.25% gelatin, 100 mM NaPO 4 , 100 mM NaCl, and 1% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was then dried and cut into 1-2 mm strips; each strip contained the 470-20-1 fusion antigen. The strip was typically rehydrated with TBS (150 mM NaCl; 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated in panel sera (1:100) overnight with rocking at room temperature. 
 The strips were washed twice for five minutes each time in TBS plus " TWEEN  20" (0.05%), and then washed twice for five minutes each time in TBS. The strips were then incubated in secondary antibody (Promega anti-human IgG-Alkaline Phosphatase conjugate, 1:7500), for 1 hour with rocking at room temperature. The strips were then washed twice×5 minutes in TBS+" TWEEN  20", then twice×5 minutes in TBS. 
 Bound antibody was detected by incubating the strips in a substrate solution containing BCIP (Example 2) and NBT (Example 2) in pH 9.5 buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 ). Color development was allowed to proceed for approximately 15 minutes at which point color development was halted by 3 washes in distilled H 2  O. 
 Test sera were derived from the following groups of individuals: (i) blood donors, negative for HBV Ab, surface Ag, negative for HCV, HIV, HTLV-1 Abs; (ii) HBV, sera from individuals who are infected with Hepatitis B virus; (iii) HCV, sera from individuals infected with Hepatitis C virus by virtue of being reactive in a second-generation HCV ELISA assay; and (iv) HXV, individuals serologically negative for HAV, HBV, HCV, or HEV. 
 The results of these screens are presented in Table 13.

 These results suggest the presence of the 470-20-1 antigen in a number of different sera samples. The antigen is not immunoreactive with normal human sera. 
 B. General ELISA Protocol for Detection of Antibodies 
 Polystyrene 96 well plates ("IMMULON II" (PGC)) are coated with 5 μg/ml (100 μL per well) antigen in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates are sealed with "PARAFILM" and stored at 4° C. overnight. 
 Plates are aspirated and blocked with 300  uL  10% normal goat serum and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hr. 
 Plates are washed 5 times with PBS 0.5% "TWEEN-20". 
 Antisera is diluted in 1×PBS, pH 7.2. The desired dilution(s) of antisera (0.1 mL) are added to each well and the plate incubated 1 hour at 37° C. The plates are then washed 5 times with PBS 0.5% "TWEEN-20". 
 Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-human antiserum (Cappel) is diluted 1/5,000 in PBS. 0.1 mL of this solution is added to each well. The plate is incubated 30 min at 37° C., then washed 5 times with PBS. 
 Sigma ABTS (substrate) is prepared just prior to addition to the plate. 
 The reagent consists of 50 ml 0.05M citric acid, pH 4.2, 0.078  ml  30% hydrogen peroxide solution and 15 mg ABTS. 0.1 ml of the substrate is added to each well, then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction is stopped with the addition of 0.050  mL  5% SDS (w/v). The relative absorbance is determined at 410 nm. 
 Example 11 
 Expression of Selected HGV Antigens 
 The entire coding sequence of HGV was subcloned into greater than 50 distinct overlapping cDNA fragments. The length of most cDNA fragments ranged from about 200 bp to about 500 bp. The cDNA fragments were cloned separately into the expression vector, pGEX-HisB. This vector is similar to pGEX-MOV, described above. 
 pGEX-hisB is a modification of pGEX-2T (Genbank accession number A01438; a commercially available expression vector). The vector pGEX-2T has been modified by insertion of a NcoI site directly downstream from the thrombin cleavage site. This site is followed by a BamHI site, which is followed by a poly-histidine (six histidines) encoding sequence, followed by the EcoRI site found in pGEX-2T. Coding sequences of interest are typically inserted between the NcoI site and the BamHI site. In FIG. 6 (SEQ ID NO:115), the inserted sequence encodes the GE3-2 antigen. The rest of the vector sequence is identical to pGEX-2T. Expression of fusion protein is carried out essentially as described above with other pGEX-derived expression vectors. 
 Cloning of all 50 fragments was carried out essentially as described below, where specific primers were selected for each of the 50 coding regions. Each HGV insert DNA is PCR amplified from RNA extracted from PNF 2161 or other HGV(+) sera using a specific set of primers as described in Example 4C. Typically, the 5' primer contained a NcoI restriction site and the 3' primer contained a BamHI restriction site. The NcoI primers in the amplified fragments allowed in-frame fusion of amplified coding sequences to the GST-Sj26 coding sequence in the expression vectors pGEX-Hisb or pGEX MOV. 
 Amplified HGV insert DNA is digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and Bam HI. Digested insert DNA is gel purified and ligated with NcoI and BamHI digested pGEX hisB or pGEX MOV. E. coli strain W3110 (ATCC #27325, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.) was transformed with the ligation product. Ampicillin resistant colonies were selected. Presence of the insert was confirmed by the PCR amplification of the insert from the ampicillin resistant colony using primers homologous to pGEX vector sequences flanking the inserted molecules (primers GLI F (SEQ ID NO:235) and GLI R (SEQ ID NO:236). 
 The size of the PCR amplification product is the insert size plus approximately 160 bp derived from vector. Transformants with appropriate inserts were selected and subjected to protein induction by IPTG as described in Example 7. Expressed recombinant proteins were analyzed for specific immunoreactivity against putative HGV-infected human sera by Western blot. 
 Eight fragments designated GE3, GE9, GE15, GE17, GE4, EXP3, GE1-N and GE-57 encoded antigens that gave a clear immunogenic response when reacted with putative HGV-infected human sera. 
 A. Cloning of GE3, GE9, GE15, GE17, GE4, EXP3, GE1-N and GE57 
 The coding sequence inserts for clones GE3, GE9, GE15, GE17, GE4, EXP3, GE1-N and GE57 were generated by polymerase chain reaction from SISPA-amplified double-stranded cDNA or RNA obtained from PNF 2161 or T55806 using PCR primers specific for each fragment. Following Table 14 lists the coordinates of each clone relative to SEQ ID NO:14 and the primer sets used for generation of each clone insert.

 *These sequences are given relative to SEQ ID NO:178.                    
 
 The amino acid sequence of GE57 is presented as SEQ ID NO:241. 
 In the GE3-5' primer (GE-3F, SEQ ID NO:46) a silent point mutation was introduced to modify a natural NcoI restriction site. Using the above-described primers, PCR amplification products were generated. The amplification products were gel purified, digested with NcoI and BamHI, and gel purified again. The purified NcoI/BamHI GE3, GE9, GE15, GE17, GE4, GE1-N and GE57 fragments were independently ligated into dephosphorylated, NcoI/BamHI cut pGEX-HisB vectors. The purified NcoI/BamHI EXP3 fragment was ligated into dephosphorylated, NcoI/BamHI cut PGEX-MOV vector. 
 Each ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli W3110 strain and ampicillin resistant colonies were selected. The ampicillin resistant colonies were resuspended in a Tris/EDTA buffer and analyzed by PCR, using primers GLI F (SEQ ID NO:235) and GLI R (SEQ ID NO:236) to confirm the presence of insert sequences. Eight candidate clones were designated GE3-2, GE9-2, GE15-1, GE17-2, GE4-8, EXP3-7, GE1-N and GE57, respectively. 
 B. Expression of the GE3-2, GE9-2, GE15-1, GE17-2, GE4-8, EXP3-7, GE1-N and GE57 Fusion Proteins 
 Colonies of ampicillin resistant bacteria carrying GE3-2, GE9-2, GE15-1, and GE17-2, GE4-8, EXP3-7, GE1-N and GE57 containing-vectors were individually inoculated into LB medium containing ampicillin. The cultures were grown to OD of 0.8 to 0.9 at which time IPTG (isopropylthio-beta-galactoside; Gibco-BRL) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1 mM, for the induction of protein expression. Incubation in the presence of IPTG was continued for 3 to 4 hours. 
 Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in SDS sample buffer (0.0625M Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS). The resuspended pellet was boiled for 5 min. and then cleared of insoluble cellular debris by centrifugation. The supernatants obtained from IPTG-induced cultures of GE3-2, GE9-2, GE15-1, GE17-2, GE4-8, EXP3-7, GE1-N and GE57 were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) together with uninduced lysates. The proteins from these gels were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters (i.e., by Western blotting). 
 The filters were first incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody or mouse monoclonal antibody (RM001 from Sierra Biosource, California) directed to GST protein to detect the expression of appropriate size GST-fusion protein expression. Expected protein sizes of above clones are 40, 38, 39, 32, 42, 64, 42 and 33 KDa, respectively. Immunoreactivity of RM001 with bands at the appropriate molecular weight for the fusion proteins demonstrated the successful expression of the fusion proteins of above clones by the bacterial cells. Expression of the clone proteins were also monitored by the appearance of over-expressed proteins of appropriate sizes upon IPTG induction on the Coomassie brilliant blue stained gel.

 Once the expression of the HGV clone protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-GST antibody a second set of filters, prepared as above, were then exposed to several HGV(+) and HGV(-) human sera. Human sera used for Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates were pre-absorbed with the lambda-gt11-nitrocellulose filters. Lambda-gt11-nitrocellulose filters were prepared as follows. Briefly, an overnight culture of KM392 culture was prepared in LB. The culture was diluted 10 fold in fresh LB containing 0.2% maltose and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. with shaking. 
 After 1 hour the culture was mixed with an equal volume of MgCa solution (0.01M MgCl 2  and 0.01M CaCl 2 ). To this mixture lambda gt11 was added to a titer of 2×10 4  PFU/ml and incubated for 30 min without shaking. After 30 minutes (per each ml of this phage/E. coli mixture) 15 ml of molten (55° C.) LB top agar (LB with 0.8% agar) was added: 8 ml of this mixture was spread onto each 15 cm LB agar plate. After the top agar solidified the plate was incubated at 37° C. for 3-5 hr. 
 After plaques developed, a nitrocellulose filter was placed on the plate and the plate further incubated at 37° C. overnight. The nitrocellulose filter was removed and washed thoroughly with TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) plus 0.05 % " TWEEN  20." The washed filter was then blocked with 1% gelatin in TBS overnight. The filter was washed three times (5 minutes each wash) with TBS. 
 For the pre-absorption of human sera each serum was diluted 100 fold in blocking solution (described in Example 10). Ten mls. of diluted serum was then incubated overnight with two lambda gt11 filters prepared as above. Lambda gt11 filters were removed and the pre-absorbed serum used for Western blot analysis. 
 Western blot analyses demonstrated that clones GE3-2, GE9-2, GE15-1, GE17-2, GE4-8, EXP3-7, GE1-N and GE57 showed specific immunoreactivity toward HGV(+) sera. The GE-4-8 protein was immunoreactive with J21689 serum. J21689 is HGV (+) serum as determined by HGV PCR (Example 4) and HCV (+) as determined by HCV PCR and serological analyses. The EXP3-7 protein was immunoreactive with JC and T55806. JC is the HGV-positive serum identified in Example 4F that was rejected by the blood bank for being high ALT. A second JC sample, taken one year after the initial serum sample, was also positive for HGV by PCR analysis. T55806 is also the HGV-positive serum identified in Example 4F that was rejected by the blood bank for being High ALT. This serum is co-positive with HCV. 
 Further, GE15-1 and GE-17 showed weak but specific immunoreactivity toward PNF 2161 and T55806. GE1-N was immunoreactive with PNF2161, JC, T55806, T56633, T27034 and R0001. T56633, T27034 and R0001 are HGV (+) sera identified in Example 4F. GE57 was immunoreactive with E57963 and R0001. E57963 is HGV and HCV co-positive serum. GE3-2 and GE9-2 were also immunoreactive with HGV sera specifically. However, none of the eight antigens were immunoreactive with HGV negative sera T43608 and R05072. 
 The GE3-2 and GE9-2 fusion proteins were purified from bacterial cell lysates essentially as in Example 7 using dual chromatographic methods employing glutathione-conjugated beads (Smith, D. B., et al.) and immobilized metal ion beads (Hochuli; Porath). The purified proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis as follows. 
 Various amounts of the purified HGV proteins (e.g., GE3-2 and GE9-2 proteins) were loaded on 12% acrylamide gels. Following PAGE, proteins were transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose membranes, using standard procedures. Individual membranes were incubated with one of a number of human or mouse sera. Excess sera were removed by washing the membranes. 
 These membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Promega) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma), depending on the serum being used for screening. The membranes were washed again, to remove excess goat anti-human IgG antibody, and exposed to NBT/BCIP. Photographs of exemplary stained membranes having the GE3 fusion protein are shown in FIGS. 7A to 7D. 
 The Figures show the results of Western blot analysis of the purified GE3-2 protein using the following sera: N-(ABCDE) human (JC) serum (FIG. 7A), N-(ABDE) human (PNF 2161) serum (FIG. 7B), a super normal (SN2) serum (FIG. 7C), and mouse monoclonal antibody (RM001) directed against GST-Sj26 protein (FIG. 7D). 
 In each of the figures,  lane  1 contains pre-stained molecular weight standards(Bio-Rad), and lanes 2-5 contain, respectively, the following amounts of the GE3-2 fusion protein: 4 μg, 2 μg, 1 μg, and 0.5 μg. Numbers represent loading amounts in micrograms per 0.6 centimeter of gel (well size). Dilutions of the human JC, PNF 2161 and  Super Normal  2 sera were 1:100. The anti-sj26 dilution was 1:1000. The band seen at about 97K in the JC blot is reactivity against a minor contaminant in the GE3.2 fusion protein preparation. Protein marker sizes are 142.9, 97.2, 50, 35.1, 29.7 and 21.9 KD. 
 As shown in FIGS. 7A to 7D, GE3-2 showed specific immunoreactivity with JC serum. GE3-2 reacted weakly with PNF 2161 serum and would be scored as an indeterminant or negative. 
 In parallel experiments, GE9-2 showed weak but specific immunoreactivity toward PNF 2161 serum.

 Construction of Exemplary Epitope Libraries 
 A. The Y5 Library 
 Polymerase Chain Reactions were employed to amplify 3 overlapping DNA fragments from PNF 2161 SISPA-amplified cDNA. The PNF 2161 SISPA-amplified cDNA was prepared using the JML-A/B linkers (SEQ ID NO:54 and SEQ ID NO:55). One microliter of this material was re-amplified for 30 cycles (1 minute at 94° C., 1.5 minutes at 55° C. and 2 minutes at 72° C.) using 1 μM of the JML-A primers. The total reaction volume was 100 μl. The products from 3 of these amplifications were combined and separated from excess PCR primers by a single pass through a "WIZARD PCR COLUMN" (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The "WIZARD PCR COLUMN" is a silica based resin that binds DNA in high ionic strength buffers and will release DNA in low ionic strength buffers. The amplified DNA was eluted from the column with 100 μl distilled H20. 
 The eluted DNA was fractionated on a 1.5% Agarose TBE gel (Maniatis, et al.) and visualized with UV light following ethidium bromide staining. A strong smear of DNA fragments between 150 and 1000 bp was observed. One microliter of the re-amplified cDNA was used as for template in PCR reactions with each primer pair presented in Table 15.

 The primers were designed to result in the amplification of HGV specific DNA fragments of the sizes indicated in Table 15. In the amplification reactions, the primer pairs were used at a concentration of 1 μM. Amplifications were for 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94, 1.5 minutes at 54° C. and 3 minutes at 72° C. in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Each of the three different primer pair PCR reactions resulted in the specific amplification of products having the expected sizes. For each primer pair reaction, amplification products from 3 independent PCR reactions were combined and purified using a "WIZARD PCR COLUMN" as described above. The purified products were eluted in 50 μl dH20. 
 Samples from each purified product (14 μl, containing approximately 1-2 μg of each primer-pair amplified DNA fragment) were combined. The combined sample of all three different amplified fragments was added to 5 μl of 10× DNAse Digestion buffer (500 mM Tris PH 7.5, 100 mM MnCl 2 ) and 2 μl of dH20. From this digestion mixture, a 10 μl sample was removed and placed in a tube containing 5 μl of Stop solution (100 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). This sample was the 0 "minutes of digestion" time point. The rest of the digestion reaction was placed at 25° C. To the  digestion mixture  1 μl of 1/25 diluted RNase-free DNAse I (Stratagene) was added. At  various time points  10 μl aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with 5 μl of Stop solution. The DNAse I digested DNA products were analyzed on a 1.5% Agarose TBE gel. 
 The results of several digestion experiments showed that 40 minutes of digestion provided a good distribution of DNA fragments in the size range of 100-300 bp. A DNAse I digestion was then repeated with the entire digestion being left for 40 minutes at room temperature. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 18 μl of Stop Buffer and the digested DNA products were purified using a "WIZARD PCR COLUMN." The "WIZARD-PCR COLUMN" was eluted with 50 μl of dH20 and the eluted DNA added to the following reaction mixture: 7 μl of Restriction Enzyme Buffer C (Promega, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 1× concentration); 11 μl of 1.25 mM dNTPs; and 2 μl T4 DNA Polymerase (Boehringer-Mannhiem). This reaction mixture was held at 37° C. for 30 minutes, at which  point  70 μl of pH 8.0 phenol/CHCl 3  was added and mixed. The phenol/CHCl 3  was removed and extracted once to yield a total aqueous volume of 150 μl containing the DNA sample. The DNA was ethanol precipitated using 2 volumes of absolute ethanol and 0.5 volume of 7.5M NH 4  -acetate. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 14,000 rpm in an "EPPENDORF MICROFUGE", dried for 5 minutes at 42° C. and resuspended in 25 μl of dH20. 
 The DNA was ligated to 5' phosphorylated SISPA linkers KL1 (SEQ ID NO:62) and KL2 (SEQ ID NO:63). Several different concentrations of SISPA linkers and DNA was tested. The highest level of ligation (assessed as described below) occurred under the following ligation reaction conditions: 6 μl of DNA, 2 μl of 5.0×10 -12M KL1/KL2 linkers, 1 μl of 10× ligase buffer (New England Biolabs), and 1 μl of 400 Units/μl T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Ligations were carried out overnight at 16° C. 
 Two reactions were run in parallel as follows. A 2 μl sample of the ligated material was amplified using the KL1 SISPA primer in a total reaction volume of 100 μl (25 cycles of 1 minute at 94° C., 1.5 minutes at 55° C. and 2 minutes at 72° C.). The degree of ligation was assessed by separating 1/5 of the PCR reaction amplified products by electrophoresis using a 1.5% agarose TBE gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the bands visualized with UV light. 
 The amplification products from the duplicate reactions were purified using "WIZARD PCR COLUMNS" and the purified DNA eluted in 50 μl of dH20. A twenty-five microliter aliquot of the PCR KL1/KL2 amplified DNA was digested with 36 Units of EcoRI (Promega) in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction was carried out overnight at 37° C. The Digested DNA was purified using a "SEPHADEX G25" spin column. 
 The EcoRI digested DNA was ligated in overnight reactions to λgt11 arms that were pre-digested with EcoRI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). The ligation mixture was packaged using a "GIGAPACK GOLD PACKAGING EXTRACT" (Stratagene) following manufacturer's instructions. Titration of the amount of recombinant phage obtained was performed by plating a 1/10 dilution of the packaged phage on a lawn of KM-392, where the plate contained 20 μl of a 100 mg/ml solution of x-gal (5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside; Sigma) and 20 μl of a 0.1M solution of IPTG (Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside; Sigma). A titer was obtained of 1.2×10 6  phage/ml containing over 75% recombinant phage. 
 The percentage of recombinant plaques was confirmed by PCR analysis of 8 randomly picked plaques using primers 11F (SEQ ID NO:25) and 11R (SEQ ID NO:13). This packaged library containing the DNA fragments derived from the digestion of the amplified DNAs F1/R1, F2/R3, and F4/R4 amplified DNAs and was designated library Y5. 
 B. The ENV Library 
 An expression library, designated the ENV library, was generated as follows. One microliter of PNF 2161 SISPA amplified DNA was used as the template in polymerase chain amplification reactions utilizing the following primer pairs: GEP-F15 (SEQ ID NO:128) and GEP-R15 (SEQ ID NO:129), which generate a 525 nucleotide HGV fragment; and GEP-F17 (SEQ ID NO:130) and GEP-R16 (SEQ ID NO:131), which generate a 765 nucleotide HGV fragment. 
 PCR amplification was for 35 cycles of 94° C. for 1 min, 52° C. for 1.5 minutes, and 72° C. for 3 minutes. The amplified products were purified and digested with DNAse I. Ligation of KL1 and KL2 linkers to cDNA, amplification of DNA fragments and construction of libraries in lambda gt11 were performed essentially as described in Example 12A. The recombinant frequency of the library was greater than 70%. Analysis of the inserts by polymerase chain reaction using primers derived from the flanking regions of lambda gt11 confirmed the recombinant frequency and indicated that the insert size range was 150-500 nucleotides. 
 C. The NS3 Library 
 An expression library designated NS3 was constructed as follows. A first fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 470ep-F9 (SEQ ID NO:132) and 470ep-R9 (SEQ ID NO:133) and, as template, PNF 2161 SISPA amplified nucleic acids. The predicted product of this amplification reaction was 777 base pairs. The amplified fragment was gel purified by separation on a TAE gel. The fragment was further purified using "GENECLEAN" ( Bio  101, La Jolla, Calif.). 
 Fragment F9/R9 was also amplified using the extension clone GE3L-11 (SEQ ID NO:41) as source material. Approximately 25 ng of GE3L-11 was used as template with the F9 and R9 primers in amplification reactions. 
 Both of the F9/R9 amplifications were for 30 cycles of 94° C., for 1 minute, 52° C. for two minutes, and 72° C. for 3 minutes, using "TAQ START" (Clonetech, Palo Alto, Calif.). The amplification products from both reactions were combined. The products were digested with DNAse I (10 μl GE3L product and 25 ul of PNF SISPA product). The GE3L-based amplification product represented the majority of the amplification product starting material. Ligation of KL1 and KL2 linkers to cDNA, amplification of DNA fragments and construction of libraries in lambda gt11 were performed essentially as described in Example 12A. 
 The titer obtained was 2.5×10 6  phage/ml and the percent recombinant phage was determined to be greater than 99%. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the insert sizes confirmed the recombinant frequency and indicated an insert size range of 150 to 550 nucleotides. 
 In addition, a second fragment was also amplified using the GEP-F10/GEP-R10 primers (SEQ ID NO:135 and SEQ ID NO:136, respectively). One microliter of PNF 2161 SISPA amplified nucleic acids was used as template. The predicted fragment size of 570 nucleotides was obtained. The resulting amplification products were manipulated as just described for the F9/R9 amplifications. The titer obtained for this fragment when inserted in lambda gt11 was 1.47×10 6  phage/ml, with a recombinant frequency of 90%. 
 D. The NS2 Library 
 The NS2 epitope library was constructed using the methodologies described in Example 12A. Four DNA fragments containing all or part of the HGV proteins NS2, NS3, and NS5b were amplified from 1 ul of PNF 2161 SISPA DNA (prepared essentially as described in Example 12A). The library was generated using the primers given in Table 16 and SISPA amplified PNF 2162 DNA as template.

 All amplifications were for 35 cycles of 94° C./1 minute, 48° C./2 minutes, and 73° C./3 minutes. All amplifications yielded at least a fragment of the expected size. The amplified products were mixed and in an approximately 1:1:1:1 ratio and partially digested with DNase I. As above, the digestion products were ligated to KL1 SISPA linkers, amplified and EcoRI digested. The digested fragments were ligated into lambda gt11. The ligation reactions were packaged. 
 The packaged ligation products were plated. The resulting library was determined to contain ˜70% recombinant phage with an observed insert size of 150 to 500 nucleotides. 
 E. The VNS5a Library 
 Primers 470EXT4-2189R (SEQ ID NO:119) and 470EXT4-29F (SEQ ID NO:120) were used to isolate a 2.1 kb DNA fragment that contains the entire coding sequences for the HGV proteins NS4b and NS5a, as well as the 3' end of NS4a and the 5' end of NS5b. PCR amplifications using these primers were performed as described in Example 4G. Successful amplification was observed with multiple HGV-infected sera including the following: T56633 was from a blood donor whose donation was rejected due to an ALT value above the cutoff; samples E21-A and E20 were derived from Egyptian individuals suffering from hepatitis; and sample AH0591 is derived from an Australian individual who developed fulminant hepatitis. 
 The amplified products of E21-A and E20 were cloned into the T overhang site of the vector T/A (obtained from InVitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) essentially as described in Example 6. The 2.1 kb HGV inserts from these 2 plasmids were then isolated by the digestion of approximately 20 ug of plasmid DNA with approximately 150 units of the restriction enzyme EcoRI. After incubation overnight at 37° C., the products of the digestion were separated by TAE agarose gel electrophoresis. The products were excised from the section of the agarose gel containing the fragment of interest. The agarose was melted and extraction of the liberated DNA was carried out using the "GENECLEAN II" kit according to the manufacturers instructions ( Bio  101, La Jolla, Calif.). 
 The purified 2.1 kb fragments derived from the E21-A and E20 samples, as well as the DNA fragments obtained from PCR amplification of samples T56633 and AH0591, were digested separately with DNAse I as described in Example 12A. For all 4 samples digestion conditions were determined that resulted in the isolation of fragments of between 100 to 1000 nts in size. After purification and trimming (Example 12A) the fragments derived from each of the 4 HGV infected samples were ligated separately to different sets of SISPA linkers. After ligation the DNAs were SISPA amplified. 
 The amplified DNAs were separately digested overnight at 37° C. with approximately 100 units of EcoRI. The digested DNAs were then purified by spin column chromatography using G25 resin (5'3' Inc, Boulder, Colo.). Digested DNA from the samples T56633, AH0591, and E21-A were combined at a ratio of 1:1:1 and the mixture of DNAs was ligated into the EcoRI site of λgt11 as described in Example 12A. After packaging using the "GIGAPACK III XL" extract (Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.), the resulting library was plated in the presence of IPTG and XGAL and determined to have a titer of approximately 1.0×10 6  phage/ml and a recombinant frequency of approximately 70%. 
 Example 13 
 Immunoscreening of the Epitope Libraries 
 A. Isolation of Immunoreactive Y5 Clones 
 Two HGV positive sera, PNF2161 and JC, were used for immunoscreening of the Y5 library, essentially as described in Example 2. The Y5 phage library was plated onto 20 plates at approximately 15,000 phage per plate. The plates were incubated for approximately 5 hours and were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) overnight. The filters were blocked by incubation in AIB (1% gelatin plus 0.02% Na azide) for approximately 6 hours. The blocked filters were washed once with TBS. 
 Ten Y5 library filters were incubated overnight, with agitation, with PNF2161 serum and ten filters with JC serum. Both sera were diluted 1:10 in AIB. In order to reduce non-specific antibody binding, the diluted sera had been pre-treated by incubation overnight with nitrocellulose filters to which wild type λgt11 were adsorbed. 
 The filters were removed from the sera, washed 3 times with TBS and incubated with goat anti-human alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega; diluted 1/7500 in AIB) for one hour. The filters were washed 4 times with TBS. Bound secondary antibody was detected by incubation of the filters in AP buffer (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM Tris pH 9.5) containing NBT and BCIP. 
 Plaques that tested positive in the initial screen were picked and eluted in 500 μl of PDB (100 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM MgSO 4 , 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.02% Gelatin). The immunoreactive phage were purified by replating the eluted phage at a total density of 100-500 plaques per 100 mm plate. The plates were re-immunoscreened with the appropriate HGV-positive sera, essentially as described above. After color development several isolated, positive plaques were picked and put into 500 μl of PDB. After 1 hour of incubation, 2 μl of the re-purified phage PDB solution was used as template in a PCR reaction containing the 11F (SEQ ID NO:25) and 11R (SEQ ID NO:13) PCR primers. These primers are homologous to sequences located 70 nucleotides (nt) 5' and 90 nt 3' of the EcoRI site of λgt11. The PCR reactions were amplified through 30 cycles of 94° C. for 1 minute, 55° C. for 1.5 minutes and 72° C. for 2 minutes. 
 The PCR amplification reactions were size-fractionated on agarose gels. PCR amplification of purified plaques resulted in a single band for each single-plaque amplification reaction, where the amplified fragment contained the DNA insert plus approximately 140 bp of 5' and 3' phage flanking sequences. The amplified products, from PCR reactions resulting in single bands, were purified using a "S-300 HR" spin column (Pharmacia), following manufacturers instructions. The DNA was quantitated and DNA sequenced employing an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer 373A and appropriate protocols. 
 The above-described screening of the Y5 library with JC sera resulted in the purification and DNA sequencing of the positive-strand clones presented in Table 17. Positive-strand clones correspond to the 5' to 3' translation of the HGV sequence presented in SEQ ID NO:14--the polyprotein reading frame.

 Comparison of these sequences with those obtained previously from screening this library indicated that these clones all contained the same epitope(s) that are contained in the previously isolated epitope clone Y5-10. Two of the clones, Y5-114-2B and Y5-121-19A are distinguished by the fact that their 5' ends are located 14 amino acids closer to the carboxy terminal of NS5a than the previously observed start of clones Y5-10, Y5-12, and Y5-26. None of the above clones has its 3' end interior to that observed in the clone Y5-10. Thus a minimal sequence of this epitope is contained within amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:272). 
 B. Antigenic Clones from the ENV Library 
 The ENV library was screened with HGV serum J21094. This serum (J21094) was identified as HCV positive based on the first generation (c-100) HCV test. Subsequent testing of the initial J21094 serum sample, and of subsequently obtained J21094 samples, by PCR and with other HCV antigens confirmed that the source individual for the serum was HCV infected. Evidence for the presence of HGV nucleic acid was obtained via PCR analysis using the 470-20-1 and NS5 primer sets. 
 A number of phage clones were identified as immunoreactive with J21094 serum. The phage were plaque purified and sequenced. Seven of the clones (Q7-12-1, Q7-16-2-2, Q7-15-2, Q7-17-2-1, Q7-1, and Q7-19-2-1) contained the same insert. The nucleotide sequence for Q7-12-1 is presented as SEQ ID NO:143 (polypeptide sequence, SEQ ID NO:144). 
 One additional clone, Q7-16-1, obtained by the method just described, has the same 5' end as Q7-12-1, but is 26 amino acids shorter at the 3' end. 
 C. Antigenic Clones from the NS3 Library 
 A one to one mixture of the F9/R9 phage and F10/R10 phage were screened using the following sera: PNF 2161, J21689 and E57963. Both J21689 and E57963 are sera that test co-positive for HCV and HGV by PCR (using multiple primers). Each immunoscreening was of 10 plates or approximately 150,000 phage. Some of the immunopositive clones identified in these screens are as follows. 
 Clone Y12-10-3 (polynucleotide sequence, SEQ ID NO:145; polypeptide sequence, SEQ ID NO:146) was identified by its immunoreactivity with J21689 serum. The clone expresses an 88 amino acid insert from HGV NS3. 
 Clone Y12-15-1 (polynucleotide sequence, SEQ ID NO:147; polypeptide sequence, SEQ ID NO:148) was identified by its immunoreactivity with E57963 serum. The clone expresses a 64 amino acid insert from the NS3 protein of HGV. This sequence is located approximately 70 amino acids 5' to clone Y12-10-3. 
 D. Antigenic Clones from the NS2 Library 
 Multiple positive plaques were isolated by screening the NS2 library with HGV-positive serum T56633. Eleven of these plaques were subsequently purified and DNA sequenced. The locations of the inserts contained within these plaques (relative to SEQ ID NO:14) are delineated in Table 20.

 *in this table the locations are given with respect to SEQ ID NO:14. The 
 actual sequence of the clones are the complement of the indicated        
 fragment.                                                                
 
 All of the immunoclones express portions of the same open reading frame (ORF). This reading frame is encoded by the HGV polynucleotide strand that is complementary to the sequence encoding the polyprotein. This ORF extends between nts 6322 and 6865 of the sequence complementary to SEQ ID NO:14. There is a Methionine that could serve as a site of translation initiation located at nt 6388 of the complementary strand that would allow for the production of a 159 amino acid protein. 
 The smallest amino acid sequence common to all of the 11 sequenced clones is located between nts 6342 to 6606 (relative to the complementary strand of SEQ ID NO:14). The amino acid sequence encoded by this region of the negative strand of HGV-PNF 2161 is presented as SEQ ID NO:273. 
 The subcloning and subsequent Western blot analysis of immunoreactive negative strand regions is described below. 
 E. Antigenic Clones from the VNS5a Library 
 Approximately 1.5×10 5  phage from the VNS5a library was plated out and subsequently screened with the HGV-positive serum J29374 using the procedures described in Example 13. Immunoscreening of the VNS5a library with J29374 resulted in the isolation of multiple positive plaques. Six of these plaques were purified and subsequently DNA sequenced. The original strain of the DNA sequence obtained could be determined by which of the SISPA linker sequences was present at the 5' and 3' ends of the clones. The locations of the starts and stops of the obtained clones (relative to SEQ ID NO:14) and their source sera are summarized in Table 21.

 All of these clones contain the sequence of the clone Q11-22-1 in common (SEQ ID NO:274). This amino acid sequence is located immediately 5' to the minimal sequence of the Y5-10 epitope. Thus it defines an additional unique epitope in HGV NS5a (along with Y5-10 and Y5-5). Comparison of the observed amino acid sequence of these 3 HGV variants with the sequence of the PNF-2161 and JC isolates reveals few amino acid substitutions.

 Further Characterization of Immunoreactive Clones 
 A. Subcloning 
 1. Y5 Clones 
 Clones Y5-10, Y5-16, and Y5-5 were selected for subcloning into the expression vector pGEX-HisB. PCR primers were designed which removed the extraneous linker sequences at the end of these clones. These primers also introduced (i) a NcoI site at the 5' end (relative to the coding sequence) of each insert, and (ii) a BamHI site at the 3' end of each insert. Using these primers (see Table 22), the DNA fragments were amplified from 2 μl of the plaque pure stocks.

 Amplifications were performed as follows: 30 cycles of 94° C. for 1 minute, 50° C. for 1.5 minutes, and 72° C. for 2 minutes. After amplification the resulting DNAs were purified using "WIZARD PCR," spin columns, the samples eluted in 50 μl, and digested overnight with NcoI and BamHI. A minimum of 30 units of each enzyme was used in the restriction endonuclease digestions (NcoI, Boehringer Mannhiem; BamHI, Promega). 
 The digested PCR fragments were ligated overnight to expression vector pGEX-HisB that had been digested with NcoI and BamHI. Each set of ligated plasmids was independently used to transform E. coli strain W3110, using a heat shock protocol (Ausubel, et al.; Maniatis, et al.). Transformants were selected on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and resistant colonies were used to inoculate 2 mls of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures expressing non-recombinant sj26/his protein were also prepared. 
 After incubation overnight at 37° C. the cultures were diluted 1/10 into 2 mls of fresh LB plus ampicillin and grown for an additional 1 hour at 37° C. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM and the cultures were grown for an additional 3 hours at 37° C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 100 μl PBS. To the pellet, 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (0.125M Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycine, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS) was added. The resulting lysates were vortexed and heated to 100° C. for 5 minutes. Aliquots (15 μl) of each lysate were loaded onto a 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel. 
 The expressed proteins were size-fractionated by electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose filters using standard techniques (Harlow, et al.). An additional gel containing the expressed proteins was stained using coomasie blue protein stain. 
 Transformants carrying plasmids Y5-10, Y5-5 and Y5-16 expressed significant amounts of correctly sized recombinant fusion proteins. The identity of the recombinant fusions were confirmed by incubating a Western blot (prepared above) with a murine monoclonal antibody that is specifically immunoreactive with sj26 (Sierra BioSource, Gilroy, Calif.). 
 Additional confirmation that the picked colonies contained the appropriate insert was obtained as follows. A phage solution for each colony was prepared by inoculating 40 μl of TE solution with a toothpick containing a small amount of bacteria putatively expressing a recombinant clone had been inoculated. A 5 μl sample was taken from each solution and separately PCR amplified. 
 The amplifications employed the appropriate forward primer, (e.g., Y5-10 F for a colony putatively expressing Y5-10) and a reverse primer (SEQ ID NO:104) homologous to a sequence located 3' to the cloning sites of the plasmid pGEX-HisB. The PCR amplifications were for 25 cycles as follows: 94° C. for 1 minute, 50° C. for 1.5 minutes and 72° C. for 2 minutes. All of the colonies selected for further analysis produced a correctly sized DNA band with no other obvious bands under these conditions. 
 The immunoreactivity of the antigens expressed from the Y5-10, Y5-16, & Y5-5 inserts (expressed as sj26-his fusion proteins) was determined as follows. Aliquots (15 μl) of the crude lysates prepared above were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE using a 12% acrylamide gel. The proteins were electro-blotted ("NOVEX MINICELL MINIBLOT II," San Diego, Calif.) onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then individually incubated with one of the following sera: JC, PNF 2161, and super normal serum 4 (SN4) (R05072) as a negative control. In addition, one filter was incubated with anti-sj26 monoclonal antibodies (RM001; Sierra BioSource). 
 As expected, the recombinant protein produced by the bacteria expressing the antigens encoded by the Y5-10, Y5-5, and Y5-16 inserts all reacted with JC sera. No reactivity was observed with either PNF 2161 or SN4 sera. All proteins appeared to be expressed at similar levels as determined by their reactivity to the anti-sj26 monoclonal antibody. The Y5-5 and Y5-10 encoded proteins were selected for further purification. 
 E. coli carrying Y5-5- and Y5-10- containing pGEX-HisB vectors were cultured and expression of the fusion protein induced as described above. The cells were lysed in PBS, containing 2 mM PMSF, using a French Press at 1500 psi. The crude lysate was spun to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was loaded onto the glutathione affinity column at a high flow rate and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of PBS. The Y5-5 and Y5-10 fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mM Tris pH 8.8 containing 10 mM glutathione. 
 Each of the fusion protein samples was diluted 1/10 with Buffer A (10 mM Tris pH 8.8, containing 8M urea) and loaded onto a nickel charged-chelating "SEPHAROSE" fast flow column. Each column was repeatedly washed with Buffer A until no further contaminants were eluted. The fusion proteins were eluted using a gradient of imidazole in buffer A. An imidazole gradient was run from 0 to 0.5M imidazole in 20 column volumes. Fractions were collected. 
 Each set of fractions was analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels. Pools of the Y5-5 and Y5-10 fusion protein-containing fractions were separately made. 
 FIGS. 8A to 8D show the results of Western blot analysis of the following samples (μg/lane):  lane  1, Y5-10 antigen 1.6 μg;  lane  2, Y5-10 antigen 0.8 μg;  lane  3, Y5-10 antigen 0.4 μg; and  lane  4, Y5-10 antigen 0.2 μg. Human serum JC (FIG. 8A) and  Super Normal  2 serum (FIG. 8B) were diluted 1:100. The anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody RM001 (FIG. 8C) was diluted 1:1000. FIG. 8D shows the Y5-10 antigen resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane and stained with Ponceau S protein stain (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.; Sigma). Arrow indicates the location of Y5.10 antigen. These results demonstrate that Y5-10 is specifically immunoreactive with N-(ABCDE) human serum JC. 
 FIGS. 9A to 9D show the results of Western blot analysis of the following samples:  lane  1, Y5-5 antigen 3.2 μg;  lane  2, Y5-5 antigen 1.6 μg;  lane  3, Y5-5 antigen 0.8 μg;  lane  4, Y5-5 antigen 0.4 μg;  lane  5, Y5-5 antigen 0.2 μg;  lane  6, GE3-2 antigen 0.4 μg; and  lane  7, Y5-10 antigen 0.4 μg. Human serum JC (FIG. 9A), T55806 (FIG. 9B), and  Super Normal  2 serum (FIG. 9C) were diluted 1:100. RM001, the anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody, (FIG. 9D) was diluted 1:1000. Arrows indicate the locations of antigens Y5.5, GE3.2 and Y5.10. These results show specific immunoreactivity of the Y5-5 antigen with the JC serum. Further, the antigens GE3-2 and Y5-10 were reactive with T55806. However, the Y5-5 antigen was not reactive with the HGV-positive sera T55806. 
 The Y5-10 antigen was also size-fractionated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained using coomasie blue protein stain. The gel was scanned for purity with a laser densitometer. The purity of the Y5-10 fusion protein was approximately 95%. 
 2. Env Clones 
 The immunoclone Q7-12-1 was originally isolated by screening the ENV epitope library with the HGV positive sera J21094. Sequence specific primers were employed to isolate the HGV insert contained within the Q7-12-1 λgt11 clone. The Q7-12-1 insert was excised and cloned into pGEX-Nde. The sequence of the insert was confirmed by the DNA sequencing (SEQ ID NO:275). 
 3. NS3 Clones 
 The immunoclone Y12-15-1 was originally isolated by screening the NS3 epitope library with the HGV positive sera E57963. Sequence specific primers were employed to isolate the HGV insert contained within the Y12-15-1 λgt11 clone. The Y12-15-1 insert was excised and cloned into pGEX-Nde. The sequence of the insert was confirmed by the DNA sequencing (SEQ ID NO:276). 
 The immunoclone Y12-10-3 was originally isolated by screening the NS3 epitope library with the HGV positive sera J21689. Sequence specific primers were employed to isolate the HGV insert contained within the Y12-10-3 λgt11 clone. The Y12-10-3 insert was excised and cloned into pGEX-Nde. Production of fusion proteins by selected clone was evaluated by Western blot analysis. The sequence of the insert was confirmed by the DNA sequencing (SEQ ID NO:277). 
 4. NS2 Clones 
 Multiple negative strand immunoclones derived from sequences complementary to the sequences of the NS2 region of SEQ ID NO:14 were isolated. There are at least 2 significant ORFs encoded by the negative strand of HGV. The first of these ORFs, represented by the Q9 series of clones was described above. The second of these ORFs is located between nts 6723 and 7259 of the complement of SEQ ID NO:14 and also possess a 5' methionine at nt 6774. The second ORF encodes a 162 amino acid protein. 
 Selected portions of the sequences of both of these negative strand ORFs were cloned into the expression vector pGEX-Nde. All of these subclones were obtained by the PCR amplification of PNF 2161 SISPA material using appropriate oligonucleotide primers, thus they contain the sequence of the HGV-PNF 2161 variant. Table 23 indicates the names, size of the ORF and locations relative to the complement of SEQ ID NO:14.

 The first 2 lines of this table identify the locations of the NS2 region 5' and 3' negative strand ORFs relative to the complement of SEQ ID NO:14. The remaining lines indicate the specific nucleotide sequences expressed by all of the 9 clones. Note that several of the clones express amino acids located 5' to the hypothetical HGV initiating methionine of the ORF. Also note that the last clone listed, K3p-KF2/KR1, is a chimera expressing the indicated portions of the 5' ORF followed by the indicated portions of the 3' ORF. 
 All of the DNA fragments were subsequently cloned into pGEX-Nde. Insert containing clones were also identified and confirmed.

 These sequences were cloned into the vector pGEX-Nde for expression of the encoded protein antigens. 
 B. Western Blot Analysis of Selected HGV Subclones 
 To determine the reactivity of both the negative and positive strand constructs described above whole cell lysates from bacteria expressing the various HGV subclones were prepared essentially as described in Example 13B. Aliquots of the expressed proteins were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, the proteins transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and the filters probed with HGV-positive or control sera (e.g., anti-SJ26 MAB RM01). The blots were incubated with an appropriate reporter antibody. 
 With respect to the HGV proteins tested, clear immunoreactivity to the protein NORF-F3/R2 was detected with the HGV sera J21689 and T56633. The NORF-F3/R2 subclone expresses the amino acid sequences that were also encoded by the Q9 series of negative strand epitope clones. The observed strong reactivity with HGV sera T56633 confirms the immunoreactivity of this region of the negative strand of HGV. Reactivity to the NORF-F3/R2 protein was not observed with the sera from the HGV negative individual R04316 or any of 5 other HGV negative supernormal sera tested. 
 Additional blots indicated that the other major 5' ORF clone NORF KF2-R4, which expresses amino acids of the carboxy terminal half of the 5' negative strand ORF located does not react with the HGV-positive sera T56633. This observation in conjunction with the locations of the Q9 epitope clones described above suggest that the immunogenic epitope of this portion of the negative strand is contained within the 55 amino acid delineated above (SEQ ID NO:273). The fact that this sequence is recognized by other HGV antisera, including J21689, indicates that immunoreactivity towards this sequence is relatively widespread among HGV infected individuals. 
 Further, clear immunoreactivity with the Y12-10-3 protein was observed with the HGV-infected sera J21689, J29374, and E57963. The specificity of this reactivity is additionally supported by the failure to observe immunoreactivity with the HGV antisera J29374 or E57963 in the absence of the induction of Y12-10-3 protein expression by IPTG. No reactivity to Y12-10-3 was observed with any of 7 supernormal sera tested. 
 Example 15 
 A Multi-Antigen HGV Diagnostic Assay 
 Although the epitope clones described above do not appear to be reactive with all HGV PCR-positive sera, many of these clones react with a substantial fraction of the HGV infected sera they have been tested against. Additionally these proteins have not exhibited substantial cross reactivity with HGV-negative sera. It is therefore possible to construct a diagnostic assay in which several of these proteins are combined so that the individual reactivities of the protein are summed. Such an assay is expected to have a relatively high sensitivity for the detection of HGV-positive sera and a relatively low background reactivity with HGV- negative sera. 
 Exemplary epitopes/antigens useful in such an assay include, but are not limited to, NORF-F3/R2 (NS2-Neg strand), Y12-10-3 (NS3), Q11-F2-R1 (NS5a), Y5-10 (NS5a), Y5-5 (NS5a), Q11-F2-R2 (combines 2 epitopes of NS5a). 
 For this assay, individual antigens are typically selected that contain different unique epitopes that recognized different subset of HGV-positive sera. Further, such antigens typically do not significantly react with HGV-negative sera. Following the guidance of the present invention, additional useful immunogenic clones can be isolated. 
 A multi-antigen diagnostic assay can take many formats. In one embodiment, the assay might entail immobilizing each of, et al., 5 HGV proteins and control proteins at separate locations on a nitrocellulose strip or other convenient solid phase format. Alternatively the non-viral portions of, for example, an HGV-fusion protein could be modified, either by insertions or deletions such that they would naturally migrate to easily distinguishable locations upon SDS PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. Strips are then incubated in test sera. After detection of bound antibody, a serum may then be scored based on (i) the number of antigens with which it is immunoreactive, and (ii) the strength of the immunological reactions. Reactivity to a non-HGV control protein would render a serum un-typeable. Reactivity with no HGV protein would classify a serum as HGV-negative. 
 ELISA-based screening assay can be formed by combining purified antigen proteins in a single reaction zone or by creating protein constructs that express 2 or more of the reactive epitopes as a single protein (e.g., a HGV mosaic polypeptide). The methods to construct mosaic polypeptides is described herein. Q11-F2-R2 construct described above, in fact, represents a "matrix protein" that encodes 2 individual epitopes in a single polypeptide chain. Western blot assays may serve as a confirmatory assay for such an ELISA screening test. 
 Alternatively or in addition, full length HGV proteins, such as E2, NS5a and NS3 might be placed in a single reaction zone. Sera reactive with such proteins may also be confirmed as HGV positive by Western blot assay.

 Expression of Large HGV Polypeptides 
 A. Expression of Larger HGV Antigens in E. coli 
 1. Cloning and Expression 
 To identify conformational HGV epitopes (not covered by small overlapping HGV constructs or by phage library screening) larger HGV protein constructs were generated in the pET-21a(+) vector (Novagen, Wis.) based on the prediction of cleavage sites (Bazan, et al., 1989; Chambers, et al., 1990b; Grakoui, et al., 1993; Kyte and Doolittle, 1982). Individual HGV protein constructs were generated in a similar fashion to HGV sequences cloned into PGEX vectors. 
 Briefly, selected HGV sequences were RT-PCR amplified from a HGV(+) human sera source using HGV sequence specific primers. The primers were engineered to contain appropriate restriction sites for cloning manipulations in the pET vector. Coding sequences of interest were typically inserted between the EcoRI site and the HindIII sites in the vector to produce 5' in-frame fusions with T7.Tag leader sequence and 3' in-frame fusion with a hexamer histidine sequence. T7.Tag (an 11 amino acid sequence) allows the detection of the fusion proteins using an anti-T7.Tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen, Wis.). The histidine hexamer at the carboxyl end of the fusion protein allows the purification of the protein using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. 
 HGV fragments were ligated into appropriately digested pET-21a(+) vectors. Ligated products were transformed into competent E. coli (HMS174; Novagen, Wis.). Plasmid DNA from transformed HMS174 was analyzed for the presence of HGV sequences by PCR, using primers T7F(SEQ ID NO:157) and T7R(SEQ ID NO:158), which are homologous to pET-21a(+) vector sequences flanking the inserted molecule. The size of the PCR product was the insert size plus approximately 260 bp derived from the vector. 
 For each construct the PCR results confirmed the presence of the insert sequences. Transformants with appropriate inserts were selected, plasmid DNAs with HGV inserts prepared and introduced into HMS174(DE3) competent E. coli (Novagen, Wis.) for the expression of HGV proteins. 
 Expression of HGV proteins was induced with 1 mM IPTG. Expression of the T7.Tag fusion proteins was monitored by the appearance of the predicted size proteins on the Coomassie blue stained gel. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-T7.Tag antibody (Novagen, Wis.). HGV proteins expressed in pET-21a(+) vector are shown in the Table 25. The start and end points of the expressed sequences are given relative to SEQ ID NO:14. The amino acid sequence of GE-Cap is shown in SEQ ID NO:185.

 FIG. 12 shows the expression of each HGV proteins demonstrated by Western blot analysis with T7.Tag monoclonal antibody. The lanes in FIG. 12 are as follows:  Lane  1, pre-stained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad);  Lane  2, uninduced GE-Cap lysate; Lanes 3-11, IPTG induced lysates of GE-Cap, E1a, E2, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS4, and NS5b lysate, respectively.  Lane  12 contained 1 μg of purified NS5a. Locations of each antigen are marked with arrow heads. As shown in FIG. 12 all the HGV proteins were expressed in E. coli. 
 2. Western Blot Analyses of HGV proteins expressed in PET vector 
 Western blot analyses of the HGV protein expressed in pET vector were performed as described in Example 11C using E. coli whole cell lysates and pre-absorbed sera. The results of these analyses demonstrated that several of pET HGV proteins are specifically immunoreactive with HGV-positive human sera but not with HGV-negative human sera. GE-NS2b-1 protein was immunoreactive with J21689 serum. The GE-NS5a-3 protein was immunoreactivity with several HGV (+) sera on Western blot analysis, including JC, T55806, T56633, J21689, E57963 and R0001. Among these sera T55806, J21689 and E57963 are HCV co-positive (by the PCR analysis). Neither GE-NS2b-1 nor GE-NS5a-3 were immunoreactive with several HGV negative sera tested. 
 FIGS. 10A to 10F show the exemplary results of a series of Western blot experiments examining the reactivity of antigens GE-NS2b and GE-NS5a3. The lanes in each blot of FIGS. 10A to 10F are as follows:  Lane  1, uninduced GE-NS2b lysate;  Lane  2, IPTG induced GE-NS2b lysate;  Lane  3, uninduced GE-NS5a lysate; and  Lane  4, IPTG induced GE-NS5a lysate.

The serum or monoclonal antibody that was used is indicated above each blot. Human sera were diluted 1:100 and anti-T7.Tag mouse monoclonal antibody was diluted 1:1000. 
 In addition to the sera listed above, additional HGV-PCR positive sera have been screened using GE-NS5a. The results of all these analyses have demonstrated the reactivity of the GE-NS5a antigen with multiple HGV-infected sera. 
 GE-NS5b was immunoreactive with HGV(+) sera JC and T55806 but was not immunoreactive with HGV(-) negative sera tested. FIGS. 13A to 13E show the results of a series of Western blot experiments examining the reactivity of antigen GE-NS5b. The lanes in each blot the figures are as follows:  Lane  1, pre-stained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad);  Lane  2, uninduced GE-NS5b lysate;  Lane  3, IPTG induced GE-NS5b lysate. 
 Each blot was incubated with a human serum or mouse monoclonal antibody: FIG. 13A, anti-T7.Tag monoclonal antibody; FIG. 13B, JC; FIG. 13C, T55806; and FIG. 13D, T43608 (super normal serum). FIG. 13E is a Coomassie Stain. 
 FIGS. 14A to 14D show the results of a series of Western blot experiments examining the reactivity of antigen GE-E2. The lanes in each of FIGS. 14A to 14D are as follows:  Lane  1, pre-stained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad);  Lane  2, uninduced GE-E2 lysate;  Lane  3, IPTG induced GE-E2 lysate. Each blot was incubated with a human serum or mouse monoclonal antibody: FIG. 14A, anti-T7.Tag monoclonal antibody; FIG. 14B, 3831781; and FIG. 14C, T43608 (super normal serum). FIG. 14D is Coomassie Stain. The serum or monoclonal antibody that was used is indicated above each blot. GE-E2 protein was immunoreactive with HGV- positive serum  3831781 but was not immunoreactive with supernormal serum T43608 (FIGS. 14B and 14C, respectively). 
 Antigens GE-Cap and GE-NS4a were also specifically immunoreactive with HGV(+) serum J21689. 
 B. Expression larger HGV Antigens in Insect Cells 
 Expression of proteins using recombinant baculoviruses offers the following advantages (i) a high level of recombinant protein expression, and (ii) the benefits of a higher eucaryotic system, including efficient protein translocation and modification. This system is particularly useful for expression of translocated proteins, e.g., HGV E1, E2 and NS2a. 
 1. Cloning and Expression 
 Spodoptera frugiperda insect cell culture Sf21 and a derivative of Autografa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus "BACULOGOLD" (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) were used for expression of HGV polypeptides. Established protocols were used for insect cell cultivation and for generation of recombinant baculoviruses by co-transfection of baculovirus plasmid transfer vectors with linearized baculovirus DNA (King, 1992). Conventional techniques were used for construction of baculovirus plasmid transfer vectors (Maniatis, et al.; Sambrook, et al.). 
 The baculovirus transfer vector pAcYM1 (King, et al., 1992) was modified by ligating a double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for a Histidine hexamer into the vector's BamHI cloning site (vector designated pAcYMIH). A stop codon (TAA) was placed after the Histidine hexamer sequence. This provides a histidine hexamer on the carboxy-termini of expressed proteins. The BamHI cloning site of the pAcYMI parent vector remained intact in the pAcYMIH and could be used for cloning various genes in-frame with the Histidine hexamer. The histidine hexamer provides a method of rapid and efficient purification of the expressed protein (Janknecht, et al., 1991). 
 A second baculovirus transfer vector, pVT-Bac, was also modified in a similar manner to provide a histidine hexamer on the carboxy-termini of expressed proteins. pVT-Bac like the pAcYMI vector contains a strong late polyhedrin promoter. In addition, pVT-Bac also provides a strong insect translocation signal sequence to ensure efficient translocation of the expressed proteins (Tessier, et al., 1991). The pVT-Bac vector was modified by ligating a double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for a histidine hexamer into the vector's BamHI cloning site (yielding the pVT-BacH vector). The BamHI cloning site of the pVT-Bac parent vector remains intact in the obtained pVT-BacH vector and can be used for cloning genes in-frame with the insect leader sequence and the histidine hexamer sequence. 
 DNA fragments coding for various HGV genes were obtained by reverse transcription PCR. Regions of the HGV genome were selected according to predicted cleavage sites (Bazan, et al., 1989; Chambers, et al., 1990b; Grakoui, et al., 1993; Kyte and Doolittle, 1982). The following primer pairs were used in RT-PCR amplification reactions using PNF 2161 source nucleic acid: E1, SEQ ID NO:242, SEQ ID NO:243; E2B (HGV signal sequence), SEQ ID NO:246, SEQ ID NO:247; E2C (insect signal sequence), SEQ ID NO:244, SEQ ID NO:245; NS2a, SEQ ID NO:248, SEQ ID NO:249; NS2b, SEQ ID NO:250, SEQ ID NO:251; NS3, SEQ ID NO:252, SEQ ID NO:253; NS4a, SEQ ID NO:254, SEQ ID NO:255; NS4b, SEQ ID NO:256, SEQ ID NO:257; NS5a, SEQ ID NO:258, SEQ ID NO:259; NS5b, SEQ ID NO:260, SEQ ID NO:261; and E1-E2-NS2a, SEQ ID NO:262, SEQ ID NO:263. 
 Amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI or BglII endonucleases and cloned into BamHI cut pAcYMI, pAcYMIH, pVT-Bac or pVT-BacH vectors. Sequences coding for the El and E2 carboxy-terminal anchors as well as a hydrophobic sequence at the carboxy-terminus of NS5b were deleted in order to facilitate subsequent protein purification. 
 The recombinant baculovirus plasmid transfer vectors containing HGV sequences were co-transfected with linearized baculovirus DNA and the recombinant viruses were selected as white foci in presence of X-gal (King, et al., 1992). Recombinant viruses were twice plaque-purified and propagated. Monolayers of Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at the  multiplicity  5 p.f.u. per cell and incubated at 27° C. for 60h. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in TNN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% "NONIDET-P40"). Inclusion bodies were isolated by spinning the cell samples at 14 k for 5 minutes. The inclusion bodies were resuspended in protein dissociation buffer (10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.02% Bromphenol blue) and incubated at 100° C. for 10 minutes. The protein expression patterns analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by 0.1% SDS-18% PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The majority of the HGV proteins were expressed to a high level and could be easily detected on the Coomassie blue stained gels. NS5a and NS2a polypeptides were detected by 35s methionine protein labeling (King, et al., 1992). 
 HGV E2 protein glycosylation was examined as follows. Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses and processed as described above. Proteins were separated by 0.1% SDS-12% PAGE, electroblotted onto an "IMMOBILON-P" (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) membrane and reacted with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (Boehringer Mannheim DIG Glycan differentiation kit) which is specific for mannose residues. The HGV E2 protein that was expressed with its own signal sequence was extensively glycosylated, indicating that the predicted E2 signal sequence can function as such. 
 2. Immunofluorescence Assay Analysis 
 SF21 insect cells were infected with the baculovirus-HGV constructs described above. Cells were harvested, spun at 1.5K rpm for 3 minutes, washed in 1× PBS, and spun again. 
 For Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) (King, et al., 1992) the cells were resuspended in PBS and layered into the wells of glass slides such that the cells formed a sub-confluent layer in the wells of the slides. The slides were air-dried. The cells fixed with pre-chilled -70° C. acetone for 10 minutes and rehydrated with PBS for 5 minutes. The excess PBS was removed by blotting. The fixed cells were treated for one hour with the following "Blocking" buffer: 40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 3% goat serum, 1% BSA, 1% nonfat milk and 0.1% gelatin. 
 Primary antibody was then added to the fixed cells. Primary antibodies included a series of human HGV-positive sera and a positive control monoclonal antibody. Before use, the sera were pre-absorbed for non-specific proteins using insect cell lysate. Pre-absorption was carried out overnight at 4° C. Uninfected SF21 cells were used as a negative control. After addition of a selected primary antibody (sera), the slides were incubated for 2 hours then washed several times with PBS and excess buffer removed. A secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein (0.5 μg/ml conc.) was then added to the samples on the slides. The incubation time and temperature for the secondary antibody was the same as for the primary antibody. After incubation, slides were washed in PBS and mounted with a cover slip. The fluorescence of the cells was then determined using a fluorescence microscope. 
 The results of this analysis were as follows. Cells expressing HGV antigen E1-E2-NS2a were immunoreactive with 4/10 HGV-positive sera and weakly immunoreactive with an additional 2/10 sera. Cells expressing E1 were weakly immunoreactive with 1/10 sera. Cells expressing E2 were immunoreactive with 3/10 sera and weakly immunoreactive with 1/10 sera. None of the cells carrying HGV antigens were immunoreactive with supernormal control sera. 
 3. Western Blot Analyses of HGV proteins expressed in baculo vector 
 Western blot analyses of the HGV proteins expressed in recombinant baculo virus infected Sf21 insect cells were also performed. Inclusion bodies were prepared as described above and subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed using pre-absorbed sera. The results of the analyses demonstrated that E2 proteins (one variant having the endogenous HGV signal sequence, E2B, and a second variant carrying an insect signal sequence, E2C) were specifically immunoreactive with HGV(+)  serum  3831781. 
 FIGS. 15A to 15D show the results of a series of Western blot experiments examining the reactivity of baculo antigens E2B and E2C. The lanes in each blot of FIGS. 15A to 15D were as follows:  Lane  1, pre-stained molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad);  Lane  2, E2B lysate;  Lane  3, E2C lysate;  Lane  4, β-galactosidase lysate. Each blot was incubated with a human or rabbit serum: FIG. 15A, rabbit anti-E2 antibody; FIG. 15B, 3831781 (an HGV-PCR-positive serum); FIG. 15C, 3838857 (an HGV-negative serum). FIG. 15D a Coomassie Stain. The serum or rabbit antibody that was used is indicated above each blot. Human sera were diluted 1:100 and rabbit serum was diluted 1:1000. 
 Further, HGV antigen NS2b protein expressed in insect cells was immunoreactive with J21689. These results are consistent with the results obtained with pET expressed HGV proteins. 
 C. Expression of Larger Antigens in Vaccinia 
 1. Cloning and Expression 
 Various regions of HGV genome were integrated into vaccinia virus genome for expression. An exemplary HGV polypeptide expression strategy is given in FIG. 16. HGV (PNF 2161 variant) proteins expressed in vaccinia virus are schematically illustrated in FIG. 16. Full length polyprotein is drawn (not to scale) by an open box indicating regions of predicted proteins: C=highly basic protein, 4A=NS4A, 4B=NS4B, 5a=NS5A, 5b=NS5B. The individual boxes with nucleotide locations (below the polyprotein) represents exemplary regions of HGV for expression in vaccinia virus. The number in the box stands for recombinant virus nomenclature.  Virus # 1 was derived from the highly basic protein region of HGV Stain T55806 (SEQ ID NO:185). 
 Two sets of recombinant viruses were generated. The first set contained HGV sequences that correspond to individual protein domains based on sequence analysis of HGV cDNA (FIG. 16, fragments #1 to #9). The second set contained HGV sequences that spanned multiple protein domains, up to full length of HGV genome (FIG. 16, #10, #11, #14). 
 The various regions of the HGV genome were cloned into the multicloning site of the vaccinia expression vector. A recombinant vaccinia virus expression system was used that included bacterial phage T7 system and E. coli lac repressor for high level inducible expression (Fuerst, 1986; Elroy-Stein, 1989; Alexander, 1992; Moss, et al.). Therefore, recombinant protein is expressed only in the presence of an inducer, such as isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Both direct cloning and PCR were used for plasmid construction. In the latter, restriction endonuclease sites suitable for cloning into the vaccinia vector were incorporated into primers used to amplify individual DNA fragment. 
 A polyhistidine tag was also incorporated into every clone covering individual domains of HGV for use in purifying the expressed proteins. HGV-PCR amplification products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the vaccinia vector. Target HGV cDNA fragments were integrated into vaccinia virus genome through homologous recombination and drug (mycophenolic acid) selection (Falkner, 1988, Earl, 1991). Recombinant virus were plaque purified 4 times before a viral stock was generated. 
 The length of each clone in nucleotides is indicated in FIG. 16. The group of smaller clones (#1 to #9) are useful for HGV epitope mapping. The larger clones (e.g., #10, #11 and #14) are also useful for mapping the HGV polyprotein cleavage sites experimentally. In addition to the clones shown in FIG. 16, additional recombinant viruses covering multiple domains from NS3 to NS5b can be constructed. 
 Expression plasmids were transfected into mammalian cells which had been infected with a parent vaccinia virus. CV-1 and BS-C-1 cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were used for transfection (CV-1) and recombinant virus selection and propagation (BS-C-1). 
 2. Evaluation of recombinant protein expression 
 BS-C-1 cells were infected with recombinant virus in the presence or absence of IPTG for 7 hours after which cells were labeled with  35  S-methionine for another one hour (Zhang, 1991). Briefly, 1×10 6  BS-C-1 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 plaque forming unit (PFU) per cell for 1 h and then supplemented with medium in the presence or absence of 5 mM IPTG for another 6 h. Cells were pulse-labeled with 600 ul Methionine-free medium supplemented with 2.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum plus 60 uCi 35S-methionine ("TRAN  35  S-LABEL", ICN, Costa Mesa, Calif.) in the presence or absence of 5 mM IPTG for another 60 min. Labeled cells were then lysed on ice for 10 min in the presence of 100 mM Tris pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% "TRITON X-100." Nuclei were spun down and supernatant was collected for analysis. 
 Cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fling, 1986; Schagger, 1987). Gels were fixed with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid before they were treated with a fluorograph solution "AMPLIFY" (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). Gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film. 
 Using this method, expression of HGV polypeptides by viruses containing  inserts # 4 to #11, and #14 (FIG. 16) has been confirmed. Expression of polypeptides corresponding to other regions is confirmed in a similar manner. For example, in a NS5a construct, upon induction by IPTG, a unique polypeptide was produced that migrated just below a 46 KDa protein standard. This protein was not seen in the infection in the absence of IPTG induction, establishing the identity of the protein as NS5a recombinant protein. 
 Further, limited immunoprecipitations using HGV region-specific antisera (for example, rabbit anti-sera raised against an isolated HGV polypeptide from the region of interest) against  35  S-Met labeled cell lysate from individual virus infections was carried out to evaluate the protein expression from recombinant viruses. For example, expression of NS2, NS3, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B has been confirmed. An alternative method, to evaluate recombinant protein expression is to perform western blot analysis with HGV-region-specific antisera. 
 When the full length HGV polyprotein was expressed in #14 virus (FIG. 16), processed products of NS2, NS3 and NS5A were detected using immunoprecipitation with HGV region-specific antisera, demonstrating the usefulness of the full length HGV clone to evaluate polyprotein processing. 
 Using an expression strategy similar to that shown in FIG. 16, candidate HGV proteins/antigens can be expressed in yeast or CHO cells. Yeast offers high level of expression, economical operation, and ease of scaling up for commercial production. CHO cell lines allow secretion of the recombinant proteins into growth media for large scale protein production and purification useful, for example, for vaccine development. 
 Example 17 
 HGV Encoded Highly Basic Proteins 
 A. Determination of the Methionine used for Initiation in the Translation of HGV from PNF and T55806 
 The methionine located at nucleotide (nt) 459 (relative to SEQ ID NO:14) in the HGV-PNF 2161 variant is in-frame with the polyprotein. The "capsid" region appears to be 32 amino acid long. In other HGV isolates, such as T55806, this region is longer (e.g., about 83 amino acids). The methionine located at nt 349 (relative to SEQ ID NO:14) in HGV-PNF 2161 variant is not in-frame with the polyprotein sequence, but a methionine at the same position in HGV-T55806 variant is in frame with the polyprotein. To see if there is a read-through or a ribosomal frame shift at this position in HGV-PNF 2161, the following experiments were carried out. 
 Constructs were made containing (i) HGV genomic sequences having all the MET codons upstream of the HGV E1 region (e.g., in HGV-PNF 2161 there are six such METs and five such in T55806), (ii) two different 3' ends for each construct to allow determination of whether a ribosome shift of read-through occurs. For a given genomic DNA, if both translated products are the same size, that suggests they are terminated prematurely at the stop codon. On the other hand, if read-through or frameshift occurs two products that differ by 55 amino acids are expected. 
 A total of 21 constructs containing sequences from variants HGV-PNF 2161 and HGV-T55806 were subcloned in a pGEX vector and corresponding proteins expressed in E. coli. Sizes of the resulting translation products were determined by both Coomassie stained gels and Westerns that were blotted with monoclonal anti-GST antibody. Induced and un-induced samples were prepared for each construct. 
 The results demonstrated that the size of the protein products corresponded to that expected by translation initiating at the first MET in-frame with the polyprotein. There was no evidence of frame-shifting or read-through. 
 B. Alternative Encoded Highly Basic Proteins 
 The method of Fickett (1982) was used to scan the genomic sequences HGV-PNF 2161 and HGV-JC for sequences that potentially encode proteins (i) alternative to the previously described polyprotein, (ii) showing conservation between HGV-PNF 2161 and HGV-JC, and (iii) having predicted isoelectric points in excess of  pH  10. Two such potential proteins were identified. 
 The first protein is encoded by residues 628 through 882 (relative to SEQ ID NO:14) in HGV-PNF 2161 and by residues 556 through 810 (relative to SEQ ID NO:182) in HGV-JC. This protein is 85 amino acids long, is greater than 75% homologous between HFV94-1 and JC9B, and has a predicted pI of 11.6-12.3. 
 The second protein is encoded by residues 6844 through 7125 in HGV-PNF 2161 (relative to SEQ ID NO:14) and by 6772 to 7053 in HGV-JC (relative to SEQ ID NO:182). This protein is 94 amino acids long, is greater than 88% homologous between HGV-PNF 2161 and HGV-JC, and has a predicted pI of 12.4-12.7. 
 These exemplary two proteins represent potentially expressed highly basic proteins of HGV.

 Cloning Further HGV Isolates and Design of Diagnostic Primers 
 A. Construction of a cDNA Clone of HGV-PNF 2161 
 A cDNA clone of the nearly full-length HGV genome from PNF 2161 was constructed by cloning three overlapping PCR products into the plasmid vector pGEM3Z (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The PCR products used in this construction were obtained by reverse transcription with "SUPERSCRIPT II" (Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) followed by PCR using reaction conditions that allowed for the amplification of long target sequences ("rTth-XL" polymerase and "XL PCR BUFFERS", Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). The rTth enzyme used for these "long-range" PCR reactions has proof-reading activity (i.e. 3' to 5' exonuclease activity) that corrects mis-incorporated nucleotides, thus providing for high fidelity PCR. 
 The three products used to construct the HGV genome included (i) an internal 6.7 kb product (nt 2101 to 8834 of SEQ ID NO:14) amplified using the primers GV75-36FE (SEQ ID NO:228) and GV75-7064RLE (SEQ ID NO:229), (ii) a 2.8 kb 5'-end product (nt 38 to 2899 of SEQ ID NO:14) amplified using 28F (SEQ ID NO:230) and FV94-2864R (SEQ ID NO:231), and (iii) a 2.9 kb 3'-end product (nt 6449 to 9366 of SEQ ID NO:14) amplified using FV94-6439F (SEQ ID NO:232) and FV94-9331R (SEQ ID NO:233). 
 Initially, the 6.7 kb internal fragment was cloned into the "TA-vector" pCRII to create the clone HGV7. Subsequently, a 6.1 kb KpnI/EcoRI fragment was removed from HGV7 and combined with the KpnI/XbaI digested 2.8 kb 5'-end product (the primer 28F contains an artificial XbaI site) and cloned into XbaI/EcoRI digested pGEM3Z. This 8.8 kb clone, which lacks about 0.6 kb of the 3' portion of the HGV genome, was designated HGV-KEX-2. To construct the nearly full-length HGV genome, the 3'-end HGV product was digested with NheI and EcoRI (the primer FV94-9331R contains an artificial EcoRI site) and cloned into NheI/EcoRI digested HGV-KEX-2 plasmid creating a cloned HGV-PNF2161 sequence of 9329 nt (nt 38 to 9366 of SEQ ID NO:14) that is designated 3Z-HGV94-6. The complete sequence of 3Z-HGV94-6 is presented as SEQ ID NO:234. 
 The clone 3Z-HGV94-6 may be used to generate in vitro-transcribed full-length HGV RNA or portions thereof (e.g., using SP6 polymerase). The RNA molecules can be used to transfect human cell lines. This approach could be used to map the various regions of the viral genome, study its replication, and understand the mechanisms of HGV pathogenicity in human cells (Rice, et al., 1989; Sumiyoshi, et al., 1992; Yoo, et al., 1995). 
 B. Cloning the JC Variant 
 One milliliter of JC serum was spun at 40,000 rpms (Beckman, Spinco Rotor 70.1Ti) for 2 hours. The resulting pellet was extracted using "TRIREAGENT" (MRC, Cincinnati, Ohio), resulting in the formation of 3 phases. The upper phase contained RNA only. This phase was taken and RNA recovered by ethanol precipitation. 
 HGV cDNA molecules were generated from the JC sample by two methods. The first method was amplification (RT-PCR) of the JC nucleic acid sample using specific and nested primers. The primer sequences were based on the HGV sequence obtained from PNF 2161 serum. The criteria used to select the primers were (i) regions having a high G/C content, and (ii) no repetitious sequences. 
 The second method used to generate HGV cDNA molecules was amplification using HGV (PNF 2161) specific primers followed by identification of HGV specific sequences with  32  P-labelled oligonucleotide probes. Such DNA hybridizations were carried out essentially as described by Sambrook, et al. (1989). The PCR derived clones were either (i) cloned into the "TA" vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) and sequenced with vector primers (TAR and TAF), or (ii) sequenced directly after PCR amplification. Both the probe and primer sequences were based on the HGV variant obtained from the PNF 2161 serum. 
 These two approaches yielded multiply-overlapping HGV fragments from the JC serum. Each of these fragments were cloned and sequenced. The sequences were aligned to obtain the HGV (JC-variant) consensus sequence presented as SEQ ID NO:182 (polypeptide sequence, SEQ ID NO:183). The sequence of each region of the HGV (JC-variant) virus was based on a consensus from at least three different, overlapping, independent clones. 
 C. Other HGV Variants 
 In addition to the HGV PNF 2161-variant and JC-variant sequences, three partial HGV isolates have been obtained from the sera BG34, T55806 and EB20 by methods similar to those described above. The partial sequences of these isolates are presented as SEQ ID NO:176 (BG34 nucleic acid), SEQ ID NO:177 (BG34 polypeptide), SEQ ID NO:178 (T55806 nucleic acid), SEQ ID NO:179 (T55806 polypeptide), SEQ ID NO:180 (EB20-2 nucleic acid) and SEQ ID NO:181 (EB20-2 polypeptide). 
 D. Alternative Primers for Diagnostic PCR 
 PCR primers and corresponding assay development may be derived from regions of the HGV genome(s) typically based on the analysis of conserved regions. Based on comparisons of the HGV-JC variant and the HGV-PNF 2161 variant, the 5' untranslated region of HGV was selected as one such region for development of a further PCR-based diagnostic test for the detection of HGV isolates. Two exemplary primers are FV-94-22F (SEQ ID NO:124) and FV94-724R (SEQ ID NO:125). These primers amplify an approximately 728 bp fragment of the HGV genome. 
 Sequence analysis was performed on amplification products from reactions employing these two primers for 36 isolates of HGV (including PNF 2161 and JC, see Table 26). An approximately 400 bp region (nt 69 to 469 of SEQ ID NO:14) of the approximately 728 bp amplification product was used for multiple sequence alignments (Table 26) and further determination of conserved regions (see below).

 The development of an amplification-based (e.g., PCR) or probe-based method/assay for the detection of HGV isolates in samples involves the selection of appropriate primer/probe sequences. Two criteria for such an assay are low copy sensitivity and specificity for HGV sequences. Alignments of sequences (such as just described) can help guide primer/probe selection and design. 
 Several criteria for selecting primers are as follows: (i) forward and reverse primers of a pair should not be significantly complementary in sequence, and (ii) primers should not have significant self complementarity or the potential to form secondary structures. These precautions minimize the potential for generation of primer dimers or oligomers. 
 Primers may optimally be designed from sequence regions showing no variation among different isolates but may also be designed from regions of less homology by incorporating mixed base synthesis or neutral bases, such as inosine, at those positions to account for known isolate divergence. The following two groups of primers are examples of primers may be employed in development of a PCR-based assay for detection of HGV genomes: forward primers SEQ ID NO:222, SEQ ID NO:223 and SEQ ID NO:224; and reverse primers SEQ ID NO:225, SEQ ID NO:226 and SEQ ID NO:227. 
 Various combinations of primers, may be employed in development of an HGV diagnostic assay. Optimal combinations of primers are experimentally determined and typically address considerations for assay sensitivity and specificity. Such considerations include the following: (i) a PCR product length of 100-300 bp for efficient amplification and ease of product detection; (ii) an ability to reproducibly detect at least 10 copies of target HGV, and (iii) an ability to reproducibly detect a majority of HGV variants. 
 In addition, probe sequences may be similarly designed with mixed base or neutral base syntheses and/or may be used at reduced stringency so as to detect a majority of HGV variants. 
 While the invention has been described with reference to specific methods and embodiments, it will be appreciated that various modifications and changes may be made without departing from the invention.
