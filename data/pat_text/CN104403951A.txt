 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to a kind of microbial strains and be applied to biological adsorption radionuclide technical field, concrete, the present invention relates to the technical field of a kind of radiation hardness Fusarium and application in the absorption of radionuclide caesium thereof. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Urbanization, industrialization and population growth cause global energy dilemma, and Sustainable development demand makes the mankind more and more depend on new forms of energy.Nuclear energy is more and more subject to the attention of numerous country with its extremely low Carbon emission and huge development potentiality.While nuclear energy high speed development, also huge pressure is caused to global environment, radiocontamination is made to become one of current great environmental problem, particularly with Chernobyl and the Fukushima, Japan Nuclear power plants nuclear incident that is representative to Environment release a large amount of radioactivity, cause locality and the serious radiocontamination of surrounding enviroment, potential threat huge is for a long time caused to ecotope and human health. 
 As the important component part of the ecosystem, microbial population is large, distribution is wide, specific surface area is large, breeding is fast, adaptable to environmental change, radioactive radiation is shown to the tolerance of height.Selectivity is strong, the treatment time is short, cost is low to utilize biological action removing, reparation and improvement radiocontamination to have, and does not cause secondary pollution and does not destroy the advantages such as ecotope, having become one of hot research technology of radiocontamination improvement in recent years. 
 Ce 137 (
           137   cs) be one of important fission product, also be one of byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear bomb, nuclear weapon test and nuclear reactor, its transformation period is longer, there is higher transport property, easily cause radiation hazradial bundle by biologic chain transfer, it can discharge gamma rays, receives much concern in environmental radioactivity pollution amelioration.The transformation period of Ce 137 comparatively reaches 30 years, can retain, accumulate and move in environment or the ecosystem, cause serious environmental pollution and ecological hazard.If through feed or breathe, take in Ce 137, or be subject to being deposited in ground Ce 137 and irradiate, all can have more lasting impact to health.
       
 In improvement radioactive pollution, traditional method is engineering method, chemical method.Engineering method is the method for physically collecting and isolating radioactive substance, and chemical method adopts special chemical fix and remove radiocontamination.Although the application that aforesaid method has been succeeded, horse traction woods as Hiroshima of Japan and Liang Ge city, Nagasaki, the republican Bikini Atoll nuclear test site in the Marshall Islands and Australia adds the Reparation and Reconstruction of nuclear test site, but its cost is very high, be difficult to use in the reparation of big area radiation zone, therefore, engineering is very large with the method limitation of chemistry.Biological restoration is the method utilizing special biomagnification and immobilization of radioactive pollutent, mainly microorganism and plant, particularly microbial function utilize of greatest concern, because its cost is low, be suitable for large area repair, thus biological restoration radiocontamination becomes the focus of current research. 
 Research shows: microorganism is not only by the radionuclide contamination dissolved and precipitation, biological adsorption and absorption, redox etc. are used in Environment control, and can pass through to change plant rhizosphere microenvironment, thus the absorption of raising plant heavy metal ion and radionuclide, volatilization or fixing efficiency.Relevant research also achieves positive progress, as the researchs such as Jana Sitte prove that the mobility of radioactive nucleus uranium (U) in soil is subject to the impact of microorganism and environmental factor in environment,
         eva-Maria Burkhardt research shows that the heavy metal ion that the hyperplasia of Fe (III) reducing bacteria is conducive to comprising U is moved to underground water by soil.

 Microorganism remediation radioactive pollution is utilized to have successful example, Groudev utilizes indigenous microorganism to Bulgaria south containing the same heavy metal copper of radioelement uranium, radium and thorium, cadmium and lead pollution of soil in calendar year 2001, carry out in-situ immobilization, through the time of 8 months, the level of pollutent dropped to human-body safety scope. 
 Utilizing the radioactive contaminate environment of microorganism remediation must consider following two aspects: the first, must be strong radiation-resistant microorganism; The second, can not public safety be threatened during microorganism remediation environment, can not secondary pollution be produced.Because most bacterium is more responsive to activity ratio, therefore the ability of their reparation radiocontamination environment can be subject to larger restriction.Therefore, need from physical environment, go to be separated the microorganism with radiation resistance, or by genetic engineering technique transform some microorganisms make it obtain radiation resistance.There is no the report about radiation hardness Fusarium and application in radionuclide absorption thereof at present. 
 
 
 Summary of the invention 
 For the relevant report that there is no at present about Fusariumsp and application in radionuclide absorption thereof, particularly there is no the application relevant report of radiation hardness Fusarium in caesium biological treatment both at home and abroad.The object of the invention is intended to provide a kind of radiation hardness Fusarium and the application in the biological treatment of Adsorption of Radioactive caesium, particularly the invention provides a kind of Fusariumsp (
