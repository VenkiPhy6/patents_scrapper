 DESCRIPTIVE REPORT 
 The invention refers to an insecticide composition with a wide action spectrum on insects that are plague, mainly Lepidoptera, such as  Tuta absoluta, Proeulia  spp.,  Spodoptera frugiperda, Plutella xylostela, Agrotis  spp,  Lobesia botrana , among other, for which formulae are used that include at least one strain selected from the group formed by  Bacillus thuringiensis  var. kurstaki (Bt) strains, NRRL B-50551, deposited by BIO INSUMOS NATIVA LTDA. Parcelo Antilhue Lole 432, Ruta 5 Km 2645, Mauk, Chile, with the Agricultural Research Culture Collection (NRRL) International Depositary Authority, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, Ill. 61604 U.S.A., on Aug. 22, 2011, for which the viability test was performed on Aug. 29, 2011 by the International Depository Authority and this deposit is capable of reproduction, deposit number NRRL B-50552, deposited by BIO INSUMOS NATIVA LTDA. Parcelo Antilhue Lole 432, Ruta 5 Km 2645, Mauk, Chile, with the Agricultural Research Culture Collection (NRRL) International Depositary Authority, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, Ill. 61604 U.S.A., on Aug. 22, 2011, for which the viability test was performed on Aug. 29, 2011 by the International Depository Authority and this deposit is capable of reproduction, and deposit number NRRL B-50553, deposited by BIO INSUMOS NATIVA LTDA. Parcelo Antilhue Lole 432, Ruta 5 Km 2645, Mauk, Chile, with the Agricultural Research Culture Collection (NRRL) International Depositary Authority, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, Ill. 61604 U.S.A., on Aug. 22, 2011, for which the viability test was performed on Aug. 29, 2011 by the International Depository Authority and this deposit is capable of reproduction. Hereinafter, these strains shall be called NRRLB-50551, NRRLB-50552, and NRRL B-50553, respectively. 
 Many of these plagues have been successfully controlled at world level by applying different insecticides and by using sexual confusion (Ioratti et al., 2011); however, restrictions in the registration and tolerance of some of the said insecticides which, in general, contain chemical products, make it necessary to assess new insecticides of biologic origin as alternatives for a comprehensive handling of this plague. 
 Micro-biologic insecticide Betk-03 corresponds to a formula containing a Bt strain or a mixture of two or three Bt strains for the control of some Lepidoptera plague (Vásquez et al., 1995; Niedmann & Meza-Basso, 2006), which could affect grape berry moth and be included as an alternative for the handling of this plague. 
 This formula is characterized, in addition to the above mentioned strains, for including toxins in the form of crystals, as well as viable bacteria spores and other products from bacteria fermentation, jointly or isolated. 
 Formulae may be in the form of a capsule to prepare a suspension, a bait, a combipack, concentrates, emulsifiables, an encapsulated or miscible concentrate, or ultra-low volume suspension; ultra-low volume tablets; oil emulsions in water, water in oil for seed treatment; concentrate gel or paste, emulsifiable gel, gel for seed treatment; emulsifiable granules, encapsulated, fine, soluble, and dispersible; macro granules, micro granules; paste; contact, wettable, and dispersible powder for seed treatment; solution for seed treatment, concentrate suspension for seed treatment, without excluding other, and including all the formulae above described in any of their conventional forms. They may be used as carriers, without excluding other argyle, kaolin, talc, zeolite, water, vegetable oils, paraffinic and non paraffinic minerals, among other agents. 
 The invention composition allows controlling plagues without the use of conventional insecticides and, due to its characteristics, it does not present environmental restrictions, with the advantage of being used in organic production or other certification systems, or even applied immediately before the harvest. 
 With regard to the state of the art, we may mention  patent ES  2 057 638, which refers to an insecticide composition including:
         (a)  Bacillus thuringiensis  biomass or only its toxin, and   (b) One or more phospholipids or a substance with high phospholipids content.       
 The said reference protects a weighted ratio (a) computed as dry substance in front of (b), included in the range from 1:0.2 to 1:5, containing at least one anionic surfactant selected from fatty acids esters (C 10 -C 20 ) with optionally ethoxylated glycerol or sorbitol. It describes a composition where the  Bacillus thuringiensis  biomass weighted ratio or its toxin regarding the said surfactants is included in the 10.2 to 1:5 range. It also states that the said  Bacillus thuringiensis  strains are selected from the donegani, kurstaki, san diego, and tenebrionis varieties. It also mentions that phospholipids are selected from phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and its hydrogenated, hydroxyl and ethoxylated derivatives, indicating that the substance with high phospholipids contents is soy lecithin or its derivatives. 
 The purpose of this invention is to provide a biologic insecticide composition for plague control in agricultural, forestry, ornamental, domestic use, and wild plants, especially plagues such as tomato moth ( Tuta absoluta ), brassica moth ( Plutella xylostella ), Proeulia ( Proeulia  spp), cutworms ( Agrotis  spp.), alfalfa looper ( Spodoptera frugiperda ), and grape berry moth ( Lobesia botrana ) among other plagues. 
 The composition is formed by at least one strain selected from the group formed by NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553 strains, as well as from their possible combinations. 
 In one form, the composition is formed by at least two strains selected from the group formed by NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553, as well as from their possible combinations. 
 In an additional form, the composition is formed by a combination of NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553 strains. In another aspect, the invention also includes toxin crystals produced by NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553 strains. 
 In the present invention, bacteria insecticide (BI) NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553, their possible combinations, and the formulae they contain, allow controlling plagues without the use of conventional insecticides which, due to their characteristics, do not present environmental restrictions, being possible to use them in conventional or organic production, or in another certification system.

 Example 2 
 In Vitro Assay to Assess the Effect of the Invention Formulae Applying Three Individual Strains on the  Agrotis  spp Plague Mortality. 
 The assay was carried out by placing  Agrotis  larvae in their second development stage on previously selected tomato leaves. First, treatments were applied with suspensions containing different individual strains of  Bacillus thuringiensis , NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553 at a dose of 1 g/liter, using a formula with 1×10 8  UFC/g concentration. After the treatment application, leaves were left to dry in order to place the previously selected larvae, which were kept in a growth chamber during 144 hours, in a regime of 12-hour light during the night before being placed on the samples treated. Mortality was assessed very 24 hours. For each treatment, the assay was repeated 15 times, each time using 10 larvae. A comparative assay of the effect was carried out using a treatment with commercial pesticide Dipel WG (which includes  Bacillus thuringiensis  6.4% p/p). Data were adjusted according to the control mortality. 
 Controls: (a group of samples with no treatment whatsoever were submitted to the effect of larvae and mortality was assessed).

 According to the results in table 1, it is possible to note that the three strains, individually, reached mortality levels similar to DIPEL after 144 hours; however, it is also noted that strains under study reached control levels statistically higher than Dipel after 96 hours, with strain NRRL B-50551 outstanding and reaching mortality levels of 90% after 24 hours. This assay shows the superior effect of this invention strains compared to the commercial reference, Dipel. 
 Example 3 
 Use of BI for  Proeulia  spp. Control, Compared to the Use of Pesticide (DIPEL®) 
 This assay was carried out in a location in Totihue, 6th Region, Chile, in a Merlot vineyard, and application was started from the fruit setting to the harvest. 
 Treatments:
         T1. Orchard management (Dipel WG ( Bacillus thuringiensis  6.4% p/p)): two applications during the season.   T2. BI application during blooming, veraison and before leaf falls, against damage (5 g/l).       
 Water volume was that normally used in the estate, according to the phenologic condition (around 1000 liters/ha). 
 Applications were carried out with turbo-nebulizer, where all nozzles were kept open. 
 The assay surface corresponded to one hectare per treatment, equal to one block per treatment, separated by a road. 
 The variety used in the assay was Merlot vines. 
 Experimental Design 
 An experimental random design was used, with two treatments and four repetitions per treatment, with the application of BI and using the orchard management as control. 
 Assessments 
 As a confirmation parameter, fruit damage was assessed (bunches of grapes): number of damaged bunches/number of bunches damaged by  Proeulia  during the season. 
 Assessments were carried out from the fruit setting to harvest, when four rows per block were assessed (with treatment and control) of 30 plants per row, i.e. one hundred a sixty plants approximately. Each clearing corresponded to approximately 6 linear meters. 
 Results 
 As shown in the diagram in  FIG. 1 , the percentage of grape bunches damaged by  Proeulia  during treatment with BI was significantly less than with application of the commercial reference (T1); this was less than half in the treatment with BI (p<0.05), compared to the control. 
 These results allow concluding, although 4 applications were carried out and there is still the winter application to be carried out, that BI is effective in  Proeulia  control, decreasing damage associated to this plague in wine grapes when compared to the orchard management (commercial reference). 
 This way, BI results an effective alternative for the control of this plague in wine grapes, especially for organic vineyards, considering the optimistic results of this assay. 
 Example 4 
 Assessment of the Insecticide Capacity of Three BI Strains in Tomato Cultivation for the Control of Plague  Tata absoluta.    
 This assay assesses the effect of the application of a formula according to the invention, which includes the three  Bacillus thuringiensis  strains (BI) in order to calculate the level of damage caused by tomato moth ( Tuta absoluta ) on tomatoes under organic handling and greenhouse conditions. 
 Methodology 
 The assay was carried out in a greenhouse under organic management at Panguilemo Experimental Station belonging to Universidad de Talca (7th Region, Chile). Tomato plants of the  Maria Italia  variety were used in their fourth flower development stage. As control, an equivalent greenhouse was assessed, to which the formula not containing the invention  Bacillus  strains was applied. 
 The formula used contained the three strains of  Bacillus thuringiensis  NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553 which, in laboratory controlled assays, individually and combined, showed insecticide effectiveness higher than that of the commercial strain  Bacillus thuringiensis  var. kurstaki (Dipel WG ( Bacillus thuringiensis  6.4% p/p)) on tomato moth. 
 Design and Statistical Analysis: 
 Completely randomized design with five repetitions of ten plants each. Statistical analysis was carried out with one-way ANDEVA. After finding a significant effect of treatments, a multiple comparison of significant minimum difference was carried out in order to separate means (LSD). Data was submitted to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Barlett tests and, in the cases where assumptions necessary for ANDEVA were not met, they were adjusted according to the Box-Cox test (damage area and severity). 
 Treatments
         T0: Control with no applications   T1: Comparative application with Dipel WG ( Bacillus thuringiensis  6.4% P/P)   T6: BI 10 8  UFC/g BI application in a dose of 1.5 g/l       
 Both treatment doses were 1 g/l for their combination. 
 Treatments were applied once with SOLO® backpack sprayer of 20 liter capacity using an application volume equivalent to 300 l/ha. Treatment application was carried out based on monitoring with pheromone trap ( Tuta  Stop) and plant damage monitoring; the application threshold was 50 individuals/traps/day with 6% of eggs, larvae, or visually observed damage. In this assay, 50 plants were used, taken at random from the assay plants, after which we waited for the accumulation of degree-days (103.2). This condition occurred in the summer and assessments were carried out seven days after the application. This allowed the formula acting on larvae in the first and second stage. 
 Assessments: 
 The effect of treatments was assessed by measuring the damaged area (cm 2 ) of leaflets and larva mortality, as well as the number of dead larvae in 10 real leaves per plant.

 Table 2 shows the average of each treatment for each parameter assessed. As it may be noted, for the parameter assessed, corresponding to the damaged area, the best treatment is achieved with the BI inventive formula, which contains the three strains and results in a less damaged area compared to the commercial reference Dipel WG ( Bacillus thuringiensis  6.4% p/p). With regard to mortality, both treatments reached mortality levels higher than those of the control treatment. 
 Conclusions 
 Based on the data obtained from this BI invention formula, corresponding to the treatment that includes three strains, it is possible to control the  Tuta absoluta  plague in tomatoes grown in a greenhouse with organic management. 
 Example 5 
 In Vitro  Tuta absoluta  Mortality Assay with BI Insecticide (with One, Two, or Three Strains). 
 In this assay,  Tuta absoluta  larvae in their second development stage were placed on tomato leaves previously treated with a suspension containing different strains of  Bacillus thuringiensis  (NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553) at a dose of 1 g/liter, using a formula with a concentration of 1×10 8  UFC/g. After the treatment, leaves were left to dry and larvae were placed on them later; leaves with larvae were kept in a growth chamber for 144 hours, under a regime of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. Larvae mortality was assessed every 24 hours. Each treatment included 15 repetitions, each one of them with a set of 10 larvae. Data were adjusted according to the control mortality.

 Based on the results in table 3, it is possible to note that the three strains reach mortality levels similar to the commercial reference used, DIPEL, after 144 hours, for formulae containing individual or combined strains, with only two of them or containing the three strains. However, the strains under study reach control levels statistically higher than Dipel after 96 hours, even strain N1 reaches 90% mortality levels after 24 hours, showing a higher effect than that of the commercial reference given by Dipel. When analyzing the mixtures, it is noted that strain N2 and N3 increase their action when combined with N1, which also increases its actions when combined with the two previous strains.

 Assessment of BI (with Three Strains) for the Control of Tomato Moth Compared to Treatment with a Chemicals Product 
 Purpose: 
 This assay assesses the application of a combined formula containing the three  Bacillus thuringiensis  strains, NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553, (T2=BI with three strains) in order to calculate the level of damage caused by the tomato moth under greenhouse conditions in comparison to a commercial product of chemicals origin. 
 Methodology 
 The assay was carried out during the 2005-2006 season at a location in Quillota. Applications were carried out on Cv Fortaleza tomato plants, with a first bunch formed and second blooming. Applications were carried out with a nozzle at 2.5 bar pressure, using an application volume equivalent to 200 l/ha. Application dates were based on the orchard standard monitoring protocol; application dates were October 10, 17, and 24. Assessments were carried out on October 29 to verify the presence of live larvae and leaflet damage, while the number of bunches assessment was carried out during the harvest (February 2006). 
 Statistical Design: 
 The experimental design included three repetitions per treatment and two aisles per repetition, where 30 plants were assessed in each of them. The statistical analysis was carried out with one-way ANDEVA, with the assessed products as main effect. After finding the treatments significant effect, a multiple comparison of significant minimum difference was carried out in order to separate averages (LSD). Data were submitted to Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Barlett tests and, in cases where the assumptions necessary for ANDEVA were not met, they were adjusted according to the Box-Cox test (leaflet damage). 
 Treatments
         T1: Orchard management (Karate 5 EC, active substance lambda-cyhalothrin) 25 ml/100 l   T2: BI with 3 strains (10 8  ufc/g) in a dose of 2 g/l       
 Assessments 
 Although no differences were noted with regard to the number of damaged leaflets per plant (diagram in  FIG. 5 ), a reduced number of live larvae per plant was noted (diagram in  FIG. 6 ); this may be because BI does not show an immediate effect on larvae, allowing them to generate damage in leaflets before they die, for which reason no live larvae were noted on the plants. However, live larvae were noted among plants under chemical treatment, with a contact effect. 
 Results 
 In the biologic treatment, a significantly higher performance was noted in the treatment with BI compared to the chemical one, which would be mainly due to the fact that plants with the biologic treatment with not present damage in their growth apex, which allowed them a significantly higher number of bunches per plant (diagram in  FIG. 7 ). 
 Conclusions 
 Based on the data gathered, the BI product shows control over  Tuta absoluta  in tomatoes grown in greenhouses under conventional management with the dose, wetting volume, and periodicity indicated in this assay. 
 Example 7 
 Assessment of BI (Three Strains) for  Agrotis  spp Control on Maize 
 Purpose: 
 Assessing applications of the invention BI formula, which includes the three  Bacillus thuringiensis  strains (BI), NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553, in order to calculate the level of damage caused by cutworms on maize ( Agrotis  spp.) under controlled conditions. 
 Methodology 
 Maize was planted in 25×20 cm black plastic bags, in a substrate formed by compost, peat, and perlite in a 1:1:0.5 ratio. Plants were kept in the laboratory, in day light, in a regime of 12 hours light at 25° C. (with lights on) and a minimum temperature of 16° C. (with lights off). 
 Larvae (100) were supplied by Universidad de Talca Laboratorio de Sanidad Vegetal. In order to perform both tests, it was necessary to create a system for the plant to continue developing and the larva be fed only from the plant to which it had been inoculated. The following image shows the system that met the said requirements. 
 The system is formed by two 1-liter transparent plastic glasses joined together with tape in an opposite way. The base of the glass in contact with the soil was cut and the glass was buried in the substrate approximately 1 cm. A 3×3 cm window was cut in the glass on top in order to release the plant evapotranspiration. In addition, the base of this glass was perforated with a hot pin for the same purpose. 
 This way, we ensured that the larva would feed only from the inoculated plant. In this assay, the following products were used:  Bacillus thuringiensis  and Engeo® (Thiametoxam+Lambdacihalotrina) and an absolute control.

 Total design was completely at random, with three repetitions per treatment (3), with a plant as experimental unit. 
 Controllers were applied 48 hours before the larvae inoculation to the plant. One larva per plant was applied, and they were assessed every 24 hours. 
 Assessment of Larva Mortality 
 Clearly, the chemical insecticide has a higher mortality level, reaching 100%, while the biologic insecticide reached around 40% mortality, being statistically different from the chemical control, as well as from absolute control, becoming a viable control alternative, especially in systems where the use of chemical insecticides is restricted or prohibited. 
 Example 8 
 Assessment of the BI Concentrations (with Three Strains) on Different Agricultural Plagues In Vitro. 
 In this test, second stage larvae, obtained from eggs of each one of the species, were placed on leaves whose surface had been sterilized and then immersed for 5 minutes in the different treatments for tomato in the case of  Tuta absoluta,  grape in the case of  Agrotis  and  Proeulia , bean in the case of  Spodoptera , and cabbage in the case of  Plutella , all of them placed on previously sterilized 5 cm petri plates. Larvae were placed on these leaves inside the plates and kept for 72 hours in a culture chamber at 25° C., with 16 hours day/8 hours night regime; after this period, each species mortality level at each dose was assessed. 
 Treatments consisted in controls with the BI formula with three strains, and in increasing concentrations, from 10 spores/g to 10 11  spores per g, with the addition of 1.5 g of each concentration to 1 liter water, where each species leaves were immersed. 
 Each treatment was repeated 10 times, with 10 plates each, with a larva of each species. 
 Design was a 12×5 factorial arrangement, where factors were doses and larva species. 
 Results 
 The dose factor, as well as the larva species factor, showed significant effects. From 10 3  concentration, significant differences were noted in control without the IB formula with three strains; from 10 8  UFC/g concentration no significant mortality increases were noted, being  Tuta absoluta, Agrotis  spp and  Proeulia  larvae the most susceptible ones, while  Spodoptea  and  Plutella  showed mortality levels significantly lower than the former. 
 Mortality (%) of different second stage larva species in front of different bacteria insecticide (BI) formula concentrations under in vitro conditions 72 hours after the treatments application. Values followed by the same letter indicate the absence of significant Tukey HSD differences.

 Effectiveness of BI Formula with Three Strains in the Control of Grape Berry Moth ( Lobesia botrana ) Under Laboratory Conditions and at Different Concentrations 
 This assay assessed the effectiveness of the BI invention formula with three strains, NRRL B-50551, NRRL B-50552, and NRRL B-50553 under controlled laboratory conditions, in connection with grape berry moth ( Lobesia botrana ) control in three concentrations, compared to the standard micro-biologic insecticide Dipel ( B. thuringiensis  var. kurstaki strain HD-1). 
 The assay was carried out at the Universidad de Talca Laboratorio de Sanidad Vegetal using  Lobesia botrana  larvae provided by SAG (Servicio Agricola y Ganadero) and following the quarantine regulations of the said institution. As experimental unit, parts of set grape bunches were used, inside plastic containers covered by a mesh. Pieces of bunches were selected weighting around 5 g and formed by recently set grapes and their corresponding rachis. Wine grape bunches were used (Cabernet Sauvignon). No insecticide was previously applied to these bunches. Each repetition was formed by a group of ten experimental units. Five repetitions were carried out for each treatment. In total, 250 larvae were used for the entire assay.

 Products used in the assay (table 6) were dissolved in distilled water and applied by immersing the bunches. After draining and drying residues from the product application, a second-third stage larva was placed on each experimental unity and kept under controlled temperature (20±1° C.) until 85% pupation was completed in the control treatment. During this period, the number of dead larvae was assessed and the presence of feeding signs was recorded (presence of fecal matter) on the 3 rd , 6 th , 8 th , and 11 th  day after application (DDA). Later, adult mortality was assessed to this status, considering that dead pupas that did not emerge until 45 DDA. Dead adults were kept at 60° C. for 48 hours in order to calculate their dry weight. Finally, a variance analysis (Andeva) was carried out of measures repeated in time with larvae mortality transformed in an angular way. Mortality in adult state and dry weight were analyzed with Andeva of a factor with adult mortality transformed in an angular way and dry weight without transformation. When Andeva found significant differences between treatments (P<0.05), averages were separated according to Duncan multiple comparison test. 
 Results and Discussion 
 Treatment with BI formula with 3 strains in its higher dose of 300 gHL −1  presented significantly higher mortality that the control treatment from the first to the last assessment (table 7). Mortality in these two same treatments did not present significant differences in any of the assessments (table 7). Treatment with BI formula with 3 strains in its intermediate dose of 200 gHL −1  presented higher mortality that the control treatment from 3 DDA to 11 DDA, with no significant differences with the standard in any of the assessments (table 7). The lowest BI formula with 3 strains assessed showed no significant difference with the control treatment, and presented less mortality than the standard treatment in a permanent way (table 7). In the case of survival to adult status, doses of 200 and 300 gHL −1  Betk-03 presented mortality significantly higher than those of the control treatment (table 7).

 Results obtained under laboratory conditions indicate that BI micro-biologic insecticide formula (3 strains) in doses of 200-300 gHL −1  presents an effective control of first generation grape berry moth larvae. Larvae mortality levels reached by the 200-300 gHL −1  dose of BI formula (3 strains) are comparable to those reported in literature on field assays carried out in different countries in Europe (Ifoulis & Savopoulou-Soultani, 2004, Ruiz de Escudero et al., 2007; Shahini et al., 2010). Also, BI formula (3 strains) in 100-300 gHL −1  doses causes a significant reduction of adults emergency, although dry weight of individuals completing their development are equal to those in the standard and control treatments. This would indicate that possible sub lethal effects would not affect the surviving adults' reproductive capacity. Under plague low incidence conditions, it is possible to apply the lower dose of 100 gHL −1  of the BI formula (3 strains) in order to reach a significant reduction of emergency in adults in connection with the control, as under higher infestation conditions it is necessary to apply doses of 200-300 gHL −1  Betk-03. 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 1. BI insecticide formula (3 strains) applied in 200-300 gHL −1 concentrations present grape berry moth larvae ( Lobesia botrana ) control levels significantly higher than those of the control treatment, with no significant differences with the assessed standard treatment; therefore, it effectively controls this plague on grape under laboratory conditions, and it is recommended for use in the field under medium and high infestation conditions. 
 2. BI insecticide formula (3 strains) applied in 100 gHL −1  concentrations presents adult emergency reduction levels in grape berry moth ( Lobesia botrana ) significantly higher than that of the control treatment; therefore, it effectively controls this plague on grape under laboratory conditions, and it is recommended for use in the field under low infestation conditions. 
 3. No phyto-toxicity symptom on grape bunches treated with the BI insecticide formula (3 strains) was noted.
