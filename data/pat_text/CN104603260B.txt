 Background technology 
 The present invention relates to the formulations by applying the novel artificial manufacture containing azotobacteria, reduce fertilizer application and temperature
Room gas nitrous oxide (N 2 O) the method discharged, and improve the method for the plant growth rate and seed productivity in agricultural, institute
Azotobacteria is stated effectively to colonize in the aerial part and root system of non-bean.The bacterial inoculum and method particularly suitable for
Jatropha (Jatropha), sorghum (Sorghum), Gossypium (Gossypium), oil palm category (Elaeis), Oryza
(Oryza), Ricinus (Ricinus) and cassava (Manihot) plant. 
 Fossil fuel price quickly goes up, the quick of global fuel is reduced and about due to atmospheric greenhouse gas buildup
The worry that rapid worldwide warms has served as three big catalyst (Chang, 2007) of recent bio-fuel upsurge.Bio-fuel consumes
Environmental benefit be attributed to the greenhouse gases (CO being widely believed that 2 ) the reduced result of discharge. 
 Recently, new problem has resulted in the discussion about bio-fuel benefit.Nitrification of the nitrous oxide in microorganism
With it is naturally-produced in the soil during denitrification process.The nitrogenous fertilizer of the notable percentage used in bio-fuel production turns
It is changed to active nitrogen N 2 O captures the greenhouse gases (Barton and Atwater, 2002) of thermal energy power with 310 times in an atmosphere.Such as
The use of fruit nitrogenous fertilizer is uncontrolled, then the CO consumed by bio-fuel 2 The benefit of mitigation will be cancelled (Galloway et al.,
2008；Melillo et al., 2009；Crutzen et al., 2008). 
 The application of nitrogenous fertilizer has become the basis practice in modern agriculture, because it is for maintaining emulative crop production rate
It is extremely important.Well known is the presence due to the referred to as fixed nitrogen structure of root nodule, and beans needs the nitrogenous fertilizer of much less
Input, in the root nodule it is most of belong to rhizobium (Rhizobium), Sinorhizobium Pseudomonas (Sinorhizobium), in
Bradyrhizobium (Mesorhizobium) and Bradyrhizobium (Bradyrhizobium) (Jourand et al., 2004；
Kaneko et al., 2000；Stacey et al., 1991；Gottfert et al., 2001) nitrogen-fixing microorganism of the species in (give birth to by fixed nitrogen
Object), the symbiosis of natural beneficial is formed with bacterium, the bacterium supplies nitrogen source to plant, while being obtained from plant cell
Carbon source (Long, 1996；Young and Johnston, 1989).It has been recently discovered that some make an exception.For example, dross Methylobacterium
(Methylobacterium nodulans) is for some species in Crotalaria (Crotalaria) (legume)
Root nodule derivant (Renier et al., 2011；Jourand et al., 2005), and nitrogen-fixing root nodule can be in the stem group of some beans
Knit it is middle development (Eaglesham and Szalay, 1983；Dreyfus and Dommergues, 1981).Frankia
(Frankia), Gram-positive soil bacteria also induces the shape of nitrogen-fixing root nodule in a small number of species of the rose family (Rosaceae)
At (Moir et al., 2011). 
 The formation of symbiosis root nodule is related to complicated heredity between diazotroph and host and chemical interaction.For example,
When a large amount of following glycine betaines and flavones are secreted into rhizosphere by plant, in Sinorhizobium meliloti (Sinorhizobium
Meliloti the symbiosis) and its between plant host starts：4,4'- dihydroxy -2'- methoxy chalcones, chrysoeriol, dish
Ji glucoside, 4', 7- dihydroxyflavones, 6 "-O-malonylononin, glycyrrhizin, cyanidenon, 3', 5- dimethyl resedas
Element, 5- methoxyl groups luteolin, medicarpin, stachydrine, trigonelline.These compounds attract Sinorhizobium meliloti
To the root hair surface of plant, bacterium start wherein secrete nod factor (Peters et al., 1986；Maxwell et al.,
1989).Therefore, the fixed nitrogen for forming symbiosis root nodule is almost exclusively found in legume species.Slow raw rhizobium and rhizobium and
Plant growth promotes rhizosphere bacteria (PGPR) sharing feature.Such as other PGPR, root nodule Induction of bacterial can colonize non-beans and plant
The root (Antoun et al., 1998) of object. 
 Diazotroph finds in the bacterium of free living, wherein azotobacter vinelandii (Azotobacter
Vinelandii best research) is obtained.The more and more diazotroph species such as Azospirillums of number
(Azospirillum), careless Spirillum (Herbaspirillum), Burkholderia (Burkholderia), glucose acetic acid
Bacillus (Gluconacetobacter) reported with plant formed atypia symbiosis (Zehr, 2011；Radiers etc.
People, 2004；Pedraza, 2008).They grow (rhizosphere bacteria) usually on the root system of surface, although some being capable of infection plant
Tissue (endogenetic bacteria) simultaneously carries out fixed nitrogen, can also promote plant growth.For example, United States Patent (USP) 7,393,678B2 describes
Friedlander's bacillus (Klebsiella pneumonia) bacterial strain, colonizes root face (Liu et al. people, 2011), is applied in chemical nitrogen
Cereal (wheat and corn) can be promoted to grow under the existence or non-existence added.However, the e coil k 1 pneumonia only especially detached
Bacterium mutant strain can carry out satisfied plant growth and promote function, because nitrogenase activity is very low in most of bacterial strains.May, it is interior
The preferred examples of growing nitrogen-fixing can find in sugarcane and wild rice, medium-height grass Spirillum, glucose acetic acid Bacillus, Enterobacter
(Enterobacter), Azospirillum, Swaminathania and acetic acid Bacillus (Acetobacter) are fixed nitrogen species
Possible contributor (Pedraza, 2008；Boddey et al., 1995；Baldani et al., 2002；Elbeltagy et al., 2001；
Saravanan et al., 2008).Photosynthetic Slow_growing rhizobia section (Bradyrhizobiaare) is that the short tongue of African wild rice is wild
The natural endophyte of rice (Oryza breviligulata), and Methylobacterium species (Methylobacterium sp.)
Iuntercellular, which is colonized and grown, promotes effect to be observed in common rice Oryza sativa L.Cv CO-43, although the latter is recognized
For due to the plant hormone of bacterium secretion (Senthilkumar et al., 2009；Chaintreuil et al., 2000). 
 The research of Azospirillum points out that the dross and fixed nitrogen, endophytic characte process being similar in beans are controlled by heredity,
And exopolysaccharide production inhibits the endophytic characte in common wheat seedling and fixed nitrogen (Kennedy et al., 1997).In addition, blocking table
The mutation of polysaccharide synthesis prevents the pea dross by rhizobium leguminosarum (Rhizobium leguminosarum), rather than logical
Cross the beans dross (Borthakur et al., 1986) of rhizobium phaseoli (R.phaseoli).Therefore, diazotroph is via fixed nitrogen
Promoting the ability of plant growth to be can not be by its performance prediction in other plant. 
 Jatropha curcas (Jatropha curcas) is the small-sized xylophyta for belonging to Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbiaceae).It is several
Specific characteristic make it become biochemical diesel oil production desirable plants (Fairless, 2007；Gaydou et al., 1982；
Openshaw, 2000).These include the ability grown on marginal land；To the low demand of water；Non-food crop condition and with
Oil palm is more than to compare for 3 years, after planting the rapid oil production in 0.5-2.Correspondingly, several Asian countries especially print
Ambitious plan has been made to promote leprosy tree planting by Buddhist nun and India.Several other plants are replaced as what bio-fuel produced
Strong interest is also attracted for crop.These include castor bean, sorghum and sugar grass. 
 Because the Jatropha targeting wherein very low marginal land of soil nutrient, will be above it for the demand of nitrogenous fertilizer
His crop.Therefore, it will be high expectations to reduce any technology that nitrogenous fertilizer uses.Today, about naturally occurring in Jatropha
Diazotroph and these microorganisms be used for improve plant production rate application study it is very few.Similar situation can be in other crops
Such as it is found in sorghum, castor bean and cassava.
