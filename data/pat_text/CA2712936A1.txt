Provided are onion bulbs, plants and seeds having these characteristics (both open pollinated and hybrids, especially long-day onions) as well as methods for making these.     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  
 [0002] The onion plant is believed to originate from West or Central Asia. In Europe it has been known since the bronze ages. The bulbs of the onion plants, - the "onions" - are used in many dishes and have a very healthy reputation. Plant breeding has been focused on yield, appearance, harvestability, storability, flavour and content as onions contain several compounds that have beneficial effects on health. Some of these compounds are most effective when the onion is consumed fresh and their concentrations are often linked with the solids level of onions. A high solids onion that is mild and sweet enough to be consumed without cooking will deliver more health promoting compounds in the diet.  
 [0003] Onion varieties are characterized by day length; "long-day" onion varieties will stop forming tops and begin to form bulbs when the day length reaches 14 to 16 hours while "short-day" onions will start making bulbs in early spring or in autumn / winter when there are only 10 to 12 hours of daylight. "Long-day" onions are usually produced in northern countries or northern states of the USA (north of the 36th parallel) while "short-day" onions are produced in countries or states south of that line. Long-day onion varieties generally have a more pungent flavour than short-day varieties, which are sweet. Long-day varieties also store better and longer than short-day varieties because they have a relatively higher dry matter content or higher percentage of soluble solids (SSC) compared to short-day onions (see e.g., "Onion Planting"  publication, obtainable from the Texas A&M University horticulture website at world wide web. http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.  edu/plantanswers/publications/onions/oniongro.html). The long storage ability of long-day onion varieties provides the possibility to market onions during late summer, fall and winter (August - March/April) when mild, short-day onions are not available or scarce. Long-day onions are bi-annual for seed production. Seeding for seed production purposes occurs in autumn, possibly, but not necessarily, followed by transplanting in spring. Seed is harvested the next summer. For bulb production long-day onions are seeded early spring, harvested in autumn and subsequently stored over winter. Short-day onions can be seeded in autumn and harvested in spring the next year, or seeded in spring and harvested in early summer of the same year. As the storage ability of short-day onions is low, the availability of these mild onions is restricted to spring - early summer (April - July).   [00041 Pungency is the typical onion flavour or taste, caused by the conversion of sulphur containing flavour precursors - alk(en)yl-L-cysteine-sulfoxides (ACSOs) - by the enzyme allinase into thiosulfonates when the onion cells are cut or damaged. A by-product of this enzymatic process, pyruvate or pyruvatic acid is measured as an indicator of the pungency (Schwimmer and Weston 1961, J. of Agric. Food Chem.  9: 301-4). The amount of pyruvate produced is directly related to onion pungency as determined by taste panels (Schwimmer and Guadagni, 1962, J. Food Sc. 27:94-97). [00051 Pungency is an important commercial trait as consumers favour fresh onions with low pungency and sweet taste. Pungency masks the sweet taste of the sugars, which are present in the onion as part of the water-soluble solids or carbohydrates. Pungency is strongly influenced by the presence or absence of sulphur in the soil or plant nutrients (Randle 1992, Euphytica 59: 151-156 and Randle and Bussard 1993, J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 118: 766-770), but has also a clear genetic component as shown by Lin (1995, J. Americ. Soc. Hort. Sci. 120: 119-122), Simon (1995, Euphytica 82: 1-8), Wall et al. (1996, Euphytica 87: 133-139) and Wall and Corgan (1999, Euphytica 106: 7-13). Pungency can, therefore, vary between locations and between years.   [00061 Dry matter in onions consists of both soluble and insoluble carbohydrates. The soluble solids are in the form of fructose, sucrose, glucose, fructans and other saccharides. The analysis of dry matter can be time consuming and destructive for the bulbs. Several researchers have determined that dry matter content and refractive index (soluble solids content) are positively correlated with the percentage of dry matter and the refractive index determination avoids destruction of the bulbs (Mann and Hoyle, 1945, Proc. Americ. Soc. Hort Sci. 46: 285-292; Foskett and Peterson, 1949, Proc. Americ. Soc. Hort Sci. 55: 314-318). Low pungency in onions is strongly correlated with low dry matter content or a low percentage of soluble solids (see further below). Short-day onions, thus, have a low pungency and a low SSC at harvest, and cannot be stored for long periods. For the fresh onion market in northern countries or northern states of the USA (i.e., for long-day countries), however, there is a long existing need for low pungency varieties. This requires long-day onions that combine the properties `low pungency' with `high solids'. Such onions do not yet exist in the art, because there is an alleged genetic linkage between the properties `high pungency' and `high (soluble) solids'. Thus, long-day onions have a high pungency and a high SSC, whereby they can be stored throughout the winter.   [00071 This linkage between high pungency and high SSC is, for example, illustrated by a study of Galmarini et al. (2001, Mol. Gent. Genomics 265: 543-551) wherein molecular markers which were significant for pungency were also significant for SSC, suggesting that this characteristic may be controlled by the same chromosome region. It implies a genetic linkage or association between these traits, resulting in short-day onions, which generally have a low soluble solid content together with a low pungency and long-day onions having a high soluble solid content combined with high pungency.   [00081 Also other studies support the strong linkage between the two traits -SSC and pungency (Schwimmer and Weston, 1961, supra; Randle 1992, supra; Simon supra; Lin 1995; MacCallum et al. 2001, NZ J. of Crop and Hort. Sci. 29: 149-158; Galmarini 2001, supra). For example Simon (1995, supra) observes a strong correlation between pungency and SSC in the parent lines, the Fl, F2 and BC1 generations of a diallel between 4 parent inbred lines. Galmarini et al.  (2001, supra) and Havey et al. (2004, Genome 47: 463-468) found a phenotypic and genetic significant positive correlation between solids and pungency in the F3 generation.     [00091 Galmarini et al. and Havey et al. suggest that this linkage may be the result of pleiotropic effects. There is physiological evidence for this scenario as the higher accumulation of fructans in high solids onions, because of no hydrolization of fructans to fructose and less water uptake, is associated with greater thiosulfinate concentrations, yielding strong correlations among soluble carbohydrates, pungency and onion-induced in vitro anti platelet activity (OIAA). The increase in water content and free fructose in low solids onions could be responsible for diluting the compounds related to pungency and increase the sweeter and milder taste. The QTL  analysis as discussed in these articles shows a strong linkage in one group (E) between dry matter percentage (DM %), pungency and OIAA, while DM% and solids are strongly linked in a different group (D). This implies a strong association between DM%, soluble solids, pungency and OIAA, which would be difficult to overcome.   [00101 According to some reports (Shock et al. 2004: "Pungency of Selected Onion Varieties Before and After Storage", Oregon State University, Malheur Experiment Station Special Report 1055: 45-46) pungency may significantly increase during storage. There is, therefore, a need for onions which have a low pungency and high SSC at harvest and whereby the pungency does not increase significantly during storage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions [00411 As used herein, the phrase "to comprise" and its conjugations is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. In addition, reference to an element by the recitation of "a" or "an" does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be one and only one of the elements. Thus, "a" or "an" usually means "at least one", e.g., "a cell"  refers also to several cells in the form of cell cultures, tissues, whole organism, etc.  Similarly, "a bulb" or "a plant" also refers to a plurality of bulbs and plants, respectively.   [00421 As used herein, the term "plant" includes the whole plant or any parts or derivatives thereof, such as plant organs (e.g., harvested or non-harvested storage organs, bulbs, tubers, fruits, leaves, etc.), plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which whole plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant cell clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants, or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, ovules, fruits (e.g., harvested tissues or organs), flowers, leaves, seeds, tubers, bulbs, clonally propagated plants, roots, stems, root tips and the like. Also any developmental stage is included, such as seedlings, immature and mature bulbs, etc.   [0043] "Variety" means a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, which grouping, irrespective of whether the conditions for the grant of a breeder's right are fully met, can be defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype or combination of genotypes, distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of at least one of the said characteristics and considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being propagated unchanged.   [0044] "Phenotype" is the observable external and/or physiological appearance of the plant as a result of the interaction between its genotype and its environment. It includes all observable morphological and physiological characteristics and thus encompasses phenotypes such as pungency, PAD measurements and soluble solid contents of onion bulbs.   [0045] "Genotype" is the total of inheritable genetic information of a plant, partly influenced by the environmental factors, which is expressed in the phenotype.   [0046] As used herein, "Onion plant" or "onion" is a plant of the botanical species Allium cepa L. or parts thereof, such as the (harvested) bulb, seeds, etc.  "Bulb" is the harvested, edible portion of the plant. Onion bulbs may be developing or mature. Herein mature bulbs are preferred, which are bulbs ready for harvest or harvested.   [0047] "Long-day" onion plants will initiate bulb formation when light (day length) is at least about 14 contiguous hours or more, e.g., at least about 14, 15 or 16 hours. Preferably this contiguous light (hours per day) is provided for 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, 25 or more days to initiate bulb formation.     [0048] "Storage conditions" encompass typical conditions used to store (preferably fresh) onions, such as darkness, cool temperature (as used herein, a cool temperature means preferably below 12 C, e.g., about 3-12 C, 3-10 C, 5-10 C or about 3-5 C, preferably about 3, 4 or 5 degrees Celsius) and a relative humidity (RH) of about 60-80%, preferably about 70-80%, most preferably around 70%. Also preferred is controlled ventilation.   [0049] A "family" is the progeny of one plant, which has been pollinated by a number of different other plants.   [0050] "Hybrid" or "hybrid plant" is a plant produced by the inter-crossing (cross-fertilization) of at least two different plants or plants of different parent lines. It is understood that the seeds of such a cross (hybrid seeds) are encompassed herein, as well as the hybrid plants grown from those seeds and plant parts derived from those grown plants (e.g. bulbs).   [0051] "Fl, F2, etc." refers to the consecutive related generations following a cross between two parent plants or parent lines. The plants grown from the seeds produced by crossing two plants or lines is called the F1 generation. Selfing the Fl plants results in the F2 generation, etc.   [0052] "Soluble Solids" or "Soluble Solids Content" ("SSC" herein), is the percentage (%) of water-soluble compounds in onion bulbs as measured by a refractometer according to the method of Mann and Hoyle, 1945 (Proc. Americ.  Soc. Hort. Sci. 46: 285-292) or Foskett and Peterson, 1949 (Proc. Americ. Soc.  Hort. Sci. 55: 314-318).   [0053] "High SSC" refers herein to an average SSC of a representative number of onion bulbs (e.g., at least 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or more bulbs) of at least 7% or 7.5%, preferably at least 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% or more. Thus, average SSC of 7.5-30%, more preferably 8-20%, 8-15%, 10-20%, etc. are encompassed herein.   [0054] "Pungency" is the typical sharp taste of onion as the onion bulb tissue disintegrates by comminution. Pungency is preferably determined by measuring the enzymatic development of pyruvic acid according to the method of Schwimmer and Weston (1961, J. of Agric. Food Chemistry 9:301-304), which is strongly correlated to the flavour perception by a test panel (Schwimmer 1962, J. Food Sci. 27: 94-97; Wall and Corgan, 1992, Hort. Science 27: 1029-1030). Pungency is expressed as  Mol (micromoles, also  M or pmol herein) per gram fresh weight bulb material (pMol/g FW). It is also referred to as "PAD measurement" (PAD from Pyruvic Acid Development) or "pyruvate measurement" or "pyruvate level" herein.   [00551 "Low pungency" refers herein to an average pungency of a representative number of (mature) onion bulbs (e.g., at least about 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or more bulbs) of less than 5.5  Mol/g FW, preferably less than 5.0, 4.5, 4.0 pMol/g FW, more preferably equal to or less than 3.8 or 3.75 gMol/g FW, most preferably equal to or less than 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.3, 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, or 1.3 gMol/g FW, as determined by PAD measurement. Thus, average pungencies of between 3.5 and 1.3 iMol/g FW, between 3.0 and 1.3  Mol/g FW, or between 3.0 and 2.0 iMol/g FW, etc. are encompassed herein.     [00561 A "narrow pungency range" refers to the variance in pungency between individual bulbs of a plurality of bulbs obtained from one plant line being narrow, i.e., the pungency level of the most pungent bulb (maximum value) and least pungent bulb (minimum value) differ preferably by less than or at most 5 ttMo1/g FW, more preferably less than or at most 4 iMol/g FW or less than or at most 3.5 tMol/g FW. Preferably the maximum pungency is less than 5  Mol/g FW. Preferred ranges of pungency within a plant line are, thus, that all bulbs have a pungency between 0 (min) and 5 (max)  Mol/g FW, preferably between 1 (min) and 5 (max)  Mol/g FW, more preferably between 1 (min) and 4 (max)  Mol/g FW. Also, in one embodiment of the invention, all bulbs have a pungency from 0 (min) to 5 (max)  Mol/g FW, preferably from 1 (min) to 5 (max)  Mo1/g FW, more preferably from 1 (min) to 4 (max) iMol/g FW. A narrow pungency range is an important quality characteristic for the consumer. [00571 "Long storage" refers herein to a storage length of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months. Preferably there is no significant increase in pungency and/or no significant reduction in SSC during the storage period, i.e., when comparing the average pungency and/or SSC at harvest (or shortly after harvest) with the pungency and/or SSC level after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months of storage. "No significant increase in pungency" refers herein to an increase in pungency measurement (i.e., pyruvate) after the storage period by less than 10%, more preferably less than 5%, even more preferably less than 3%, 2% or 1%, more preferably no increase at all, and optionally even a reduction in pungency, compared to the measurement at harvest (or shortly after harvest). "No significant reduction in SSC" refers herein to a reduction in SSC levels after the storage period of less than 5%, 4%, 3% or 2%, preferably less than 1% or 0.5%, more preferably unchanged, compared to the SSC level at harvest (or shortly after harvest).   [0058] An onion plant (and seed of an onion plant, and parts derived from such a plant) requiring 14 or more contiguous hours of daylight to initiate bulb formation is provided, whereby the bulb has a low pungency, especially at harvest.  Preferably the bulb also has a high soluble solid content (SSC), especially at harvest. The bulb substantially maintains pungency after storage for about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months. The bulb also substantially maintains SSC content for about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months.   [0059] In one aspect, the invention provides onion plants, bulbs and seeds, whereby the bulbs comprise a low (mean) pungency at harvest, a high (mean) SSC and/or a long storage ability. The (mean) pungency at harvest is preferably less than 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0 Mol/g FW, more preferably equal to or less than 3.8 or 3.75  Mol/g FW, preferably equal to or less than 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.3, 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, 1.3  Mol/g FW or less. The (mean) SSC at harvest is preferably at least 7.5%, more preferably at least 8%, 9%,  
 10%, 11%, 12%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% or more. The bulbs according to the invention can be stored for at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months, preferably without any significant increase in pungency at the end of storage and/or without any significant reduction in SSC.   [0060] In addition, the onion plants provided herein produce bulbs which have a narrow pungency range as defined above. This characteristic is an important feature for the consumer of fresh onions, as often a bag of onions are bought but individual onions are used for the preparation of food. Thus, in one embodiment a plurality of (harvested) onion bulbs are provided which have a narrow pungency range, as are plants which are capable of producing such bulbs.   [0061] Also progeny of the above plants are provided (obtained by selfing or crossing), which retain bulbs with a low level of pungency, high SSC content and/or long storage ability. i.e. which are substantially identical to the bulbs of the parent(s) for these traits. Progeny include thus, for example inbred plants producing bulbs with one or more of the above traits or hybrid plants producing bulbs with one or more of the above traits.   [0062] Also parts of the above onion plants are provided. Such plant parts, derived from the onion plants described herein, may be a seed, a bulb, a leaf, a flower, pollen, stamen, an ovule, a cell, a protoplast, a tissue culture of cells or the like.  A tissue culture of cells may, for example, be derived from a tissue selected from a leaf, pollen, embryo, bulb, flower, anther, pollen, ovule, bud, meristem or any cell.   [0063] In one aspect, the invention relates to long-day onion seeds deposited by Nunhems B.V. at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209, USA) under the Budapest Treaty under accession number PTA-9053 (seeds of line I37853B), PTA-9054 (seeds of line 137554A) and PTA-9055 (seeds of line I37554B) on March 13, 2008, or any derivatives thereof, such as progeny obtained by selfing any one of the deposited plants or by crossing of any one of the deposited plants with another onion plant. In one aspect, derivatives include inbred onion plants which comprise the low pungency; high SSC and/or long storage ability as described. In another aspect, derivatives include onion plants or seeds (and bulbs) obtained from using one of these lines (137554A or B, 137853 or a derivative of any of these) as parent in one or more crosses with a further onion plant and/or one or more selfings, whereby the progeny have the same (or better) low pungency, high soluble solid phenotypes and/or storage properties as defined above and/or as the deposited lines. Therefore, derivatives may include hybrid onion plants or seeds (and bulbs of such plants) which produce/are capable of producing bulbs having the above (or better) low pungency, high SSC and/or long term storage abilities as described above and/or as the bulbs of 137853 and/or 137554A or B. Derivatives of the hybrids are also encompassed herein. In another aspect, hybrid seeds, plants and bulbs obtainable from crossing 137853 (or a derivative thereof, such as an inbred) with 137554A or B (or a derivative thereof, such as an inbred) are provided, as well as plants, bulbs and seeds obtained from using such F1 hybrids in further selfings or crosses. Therefore, various long day onion plants having low pungency, high SSC and/or long term storage ability are encompassed herein, including, for example, plants comprising the physiological and morphological characteristics of 137853 and/or 137554A or B.   [0064] Thus, a long day onion plant derived from, or derivable from, one of the plants deposited under Accession number PTA-9053, PTA-9054 or PTA-9055 by selfing, crossing, clonal propagation, or tissue culture is provided herein, wherein the plant produces onion bulbs having the same (or better) low pungency, high soluble solid phenotypes and/or storage properties (at harvest and/or after storage) as described herein and/or as the deposited lines PTA-9053, PTA-9054 or PTA-9055.   [0065] Progeny of the onion plants deposited under PTA-9053, PTA-9054 and PTA-9055 are provided, wherein said progeny produces onion bulbs having the same (or better) low pungency, high soluble solid phenotypes and/or storage properties (at harvest and/or after storage) as described herein and/or as the deposited lines PTA-9053, PTA-9054 or PTA-9055.   [0066] Derivatives also include plants obtained from tissue culture methods and tissue cultures themselves, whereby tissue of any of the herein described plants is used (e.g. leaf, pollen, flowers, embryos, protoplasts, etc.). Likewise, transgenic onions of any of the above plants are encompassed herein. Thus, onion plants into which one or more genetic elements have been introduced by transformation are also encompassed herein. Transformation and regeneration of onion uses methods known in the art. For example, one or more genes for herbicide resistance or resistance against microorganisms may be introduced. Likewise, transgenes may be introduced into the onions according to the invention by crossing the onion plant with a plant comprising the transgene(s) and selecting offspring comprising the transgene(s).   [0067] Preferably there is no significant increase in pungency and/or no significant reduction in SSC during the storage period of the bulbs, i.e., when comparing the average pungency and/or average SSC at harvest (or shortly after harvest) with the average pungency and/or average SSC level after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months of storage. "No significant increase in pungency" refers herein to an increase in pungency measurement (i.e., pyruvate) after the storage period by less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 3%, 2% or 1%, more preferably no increase at all, and optionally even a reduction in pungency, compared to the measurement at harvest (or shortly after harvest). A reduction in pungency compared to pungency at harvest includes, for example, a reduction by at least 0.5%, 1% or more. "No significant reduction in SSC" refers herein to a reduction in SSC levels after the storage period of less than 2%, preferably less than 1% or 0.5%, more preferably unchanged, compared to the SSC level at harvest (or shortly after harvest).   [00681 Also the pungency range preferably remains narrow during storage. In addition, decay after at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more months of storage (as can be measured visually and/or by weight, e.g., weighing non-decayed bulbs and comparing their weight to the total weight at the beginning of storage), is low, i.e., at any given time-point, e.g., after about 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 or 6 months of storage or more, decay is less than 10%, preferably less than 9%, 8%, 7.2%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1 % or even less.   [00691 The onion plants, bulbs and seeds are long-day onions, i.e., the plants initiate bulb formation under long periods of contiguous light, e.g.  artificial or natural light of at least about 14 hours or more. The onion plant thus preferably requires 14 or more hours per day (per 24 hours) of contiguous light in order to initiate bulb formation.   [00701 In one aspect, the onion plants, or seeds provided herein are capable of forming bulbs which have a pungency of less than 3.75/g FW, preferably equal to or less than 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.3, 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, 1.3  Mol/g FW when measured 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 months after harvest, e.g. after 5-6 months of storage in the dark, under cool temperatures and at a RH of 60-80%. These bulbs have a significantly lower average pungency than bulbs of seeds deposited under NCIMB Accession numbers 41329 and 41330 (described in W02007/011857), as well as preferably a narrower pungency range than various onion lines described in W02007/011857. In addition, the bulbs have at least an equivalent, preferably a significantly higher average SSC  content than bulbs of seeds deposited under NCIMB Accession numbers 41329 and 41330 and/or a longer storage ability compared to such bulbs.   [0071] It was found that bulbs and plants having very low pungency and high SSC content can be selected for, which was believed to be impossible. Without limiting the invention, it is thought that the genetic linkage between one or more regions responsible for high pungency and regions responsible for high SSC can, contrary to prior belief, be broken, enabling the selection or identification of low pungency / high SSC plants. Plants provided herein can be made as described in the methods and Examples herein below, using breeding and selection methods (PAD measurements, SSC measurements and/or storage decay measurements and the like). Also seeds provided herein can be used to make plants according to the invention, as the traits can be transferred from the deposited seeds to other onion plants by crossing and selection. Basically the traits (low pungency, high SSC and/or long storage ability) can be introduced into any long day onion, such as for example Spanish onions, Spanish-type onions, (northern) yellow-type onions, white and red type onions, hard-globe eastern or western type onions, etc. Onion plants (e.g., open pollinated or hybrid plants) can therefore be made having these traits and having good agronomic characteristics, such as disease resistance (e.g. Fusarium resistance), pink root resistance, bulb size, % single centers, bolting tolerance, etc.   [0072] Also provided herein are containers comprising a plurality of onion bulbs having the above phenotypes, as well as containers comprising a plurality of onion seeds of the above plants or containers comprising a plurality of onion plants or seedlings. Containers may be of any type, such as bags, cans, tins, trays, boxes, flats and the like. Also provided herein are containers comprising onion bulbs having an average PAD measurement of less than about 5.5  Mol/g FW, preferably less than 3.75, 3.5, 3.0, etc. tMol/g FW, high SSC and/or long storage ability (each phenotype as defined above). Preferably in a container at least 75%, 85%, 95%, 98% or more of the bulbs have such a PAD measurement, SSC level and/or storage ability. Also, preferably the pungency range of all bulbs in a container is narrow. A container preferably contains at least about 1 pound, 5 pounds, 10 pounds or more bulbs. The container may be in any location, e.g., a store (such as a grocery store), warehouse, market place, distributor, etc.   [00731 Seed containers comprising seeds of an onion plant requiring 14 or more hours contiguous light to initiate bulb formation, wherein the seed is capable of producing an onion plant having a bulb comprising low pungency (i.e., a PAD measurement as defined), high SSC and/or long storage ability (also as defined) are also provided. Preferably the onion bulbs from greater than 50%, more preferably from greater than 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% of the plants produced by such seeds produce bulbs having an average PAD measurement of less than 5.5 .tMol/g FW, preferably less than 5.0, 4.0, 3.5, or 3.0 RMol/g FW, etc., high SSC and/or long storage ability. The containers preferably comprise at least 100, 500, 1000, 10.000 or more seeds and is preferably selected from a bag, box, packet, tin or can. Also, preferably the pungency range of all bulbs derivable from the seeds in a container is narrow.   [00741 In another aspect, a method for producing an onion plant or seed, or a group of plants or seeds, is provided, whereby the plant, or group of plants, produce(s) a bulb after exposure to at least about 14 hours light per day (during a period of at least about 1 or more weeks, e.g., 2 or 3 or more weeks) which comprises a (single bulb or mean) pungency of less than 5.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.75  Mol/g FW at harvest (or less, as defined above) and a (single bulb or mean) SSC at harvest of at least 7.5% or more (as defined above). Preferably, the bulbs retain low pungency and high SSC during storage.  Also, the pungency range of the bulbs is preferably narrow. The method comprises crossing two parent onion plants or selfing an onion plant and harvesting the resulting onion seeds from the cross or selfing, wherein at least one parent is an onion plant as described above, or a derivative thereof. Seeds produced by the method are also provided herein, as are onion plants produced by growing those seeds and onion bulbs harvested from those grown plants.   [00751 The method may further comprise the step of growing an F I hybrid onion plant obtained from seed obtained from said cross, crossing the F1 onion plant to another onion plant, e.g., to one of the parents used, and selecting progeny onion plants having the desired low pungency and high SSC content.     [0076] In a further aspect, a method for producing an onion plant or seed or a group of onion plants or seeds, is provided, whereby the plant, or group of plants, produce(s) (a) bulb(s) after exposure to at least about 14 hours light per day (during a period of at least about 1 or more weeks, e.g., 2 or 3 or more weeks) which comprises a (single bulb or mean) pungency of less than 5.5, 5.0, 4.0, 3.75 gMol/g FW at harvest (or less, as defined above) and a (single bulb or mean) SSC at harvest of at least 7.0 or 7.5 % or more (as defined above). Preferably, the bulbs retain low pungency and high SSC during storage, show little decay during storage and/or have a narrow pungency range (all as described). The method comprises the steps of:   a) crossing an onion plant producing bulbs having a low SSC and low pungency with an onion plant producing bulbs having a high SSC and high pungency, b) obtaining the F1 seeds from said cross, c) selfing and/or crossing the plants obtained from the F 1 seeds one or more times with one another or with other onion plants, and d) identifying and selecting progeny plants which produce bulbs having a low pungency and high SSC by phenotyping the bulbs.   [0077] Optionally steps c) and/or d) can be repeated several times. Crossing in step c) may also involve backcrossing. In step d), plants having a narrow pungency range and/or plants showing little decay during storage may be selected. Thus, pungency range and/or storage ability can also be used as selection criteria in addition to or as an alternative of low pungency and/or high SSC. The same applies to the methods described herein below, even if only SSC and pungency are mentioned.   [0078] The phenotyping preferably involves determining the pungency, SSC content and/or storage ability (e.g. percentage decay after a certain storage period, which can be analysed visually) of the bulbs (e.g. by phenotyping one or more populations of step c) above) and selecting rare recombinants or mutants which have a low pungency and/or high SSC and/or long storage ability. The plants used under a) may be commercially available onion cultivars or breeding lines, such as long day onions and short day onions. Phenotyping can be carried out on a plurality of single bulbs independently, preferably grown under the same conditions next to suitable controls, or on a sample composed of (all or parts of) several bulbs. When single bulbs are used, preferably the mean value is calculated from a representative number of bulbs. Phenotyping can be done one or more times. For example PAD measurements and/or SSC measurements may be carried out at harvest and after 1, 2, 3, 4 or more weeks of storage or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more months of storage. In one embodiment-the phenotyping (PAD and/or SSC measurements) is carried out after about 5, 6 or 7 months of storage (e.g. after about 150 - 210 days, e.g. about 150 days, 180 days, 200 days or 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210 days of storage). Phenotyping can be carried out at one or more steps of a breeding scheme.   [0079] Phenotyping may also comprise an analysis of the photoperiod response and selection of plants having a long-day response, so that in step d) long day onions are produced.   [0080] In one aspect a method for making long-day onion plants comprising a low pungency and high SSC, is provided, comprising a) (optionally) analysing onion bulbs for pungency and SSC, b) crossing plants producing bulbs having a high pungency and high SSC with plants producing bulbs with a low pungency and low SSC to produce Fl hybrids, c) selfing and/or (back)crossing F1 hybrid plants one or more times and d) selecting progeny plants for low pungency and high SSC content (at harvest and/or after storage) and preferably also for having a long day length photoperiod response and/or preferably also for having a narrow pungency range and e) selecting a long day onion plant producing bulbs having low pungency and high SSC, with levels similar to those of lines PTA-9053, PTA-9054 or PTA-9055 at harvest and/or after storage.  Step d) involves pungency and SSC analysis at harvest and/or after storage. In the initial cross, the low pungency, low SSC onion parent may be a short-day onion variety, cultivar or breeding line and the high pungency, high SSC may be a long day onion variety, cultivar or breeding line. Preferably steps c) and d) are repeated several times, so that several cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection are carried out, leading to long day onions of step e).   [0081] In yet a further aspect, a method of producing an inbred, long-day onion plant comprising low pungency and high SSC is provided herein, comprising the steps of:     a) the creation of variable populations of Allium cepa comprising the steps of crossing a plant or plants producing bulbs with low pungency and high SSC (as described herein) with a plant of the species Allium cepa, b) harvesting the F1 seed from any of the plants used in the cross of a) and growing F1 plants from the seed harvested, c) selfing the plants grown under b) or crossing these plants amongst one another, or crossing these plants with plants of Allium cepa, d) growing plants from the resulting seed harvested under normal plant growing conditions and, e) selecting plants producing bulbs having low pungency and high SSC, followed by selfing the selected plants, and optionally f) repeating the steps d) and/or e) until the inbred lines are obtained which are homozygous and can be used as parents in the production of hybrids having low pungency and high SSC.   [0082] Also provided is a method for developing male sterile inbred lines with the properties of low pungency and high SSC comprising the steps of crossing the plants of the inbred lines described above with plants of male sterile lines of Allium cepa and the subsequent selection and recurrent back crossing with the male fertile parent until the new male sterile line is genetically and phenotypically similar to the male fertile recurrent parent inbred line and has the combination of low pungency and high SSC. [0083] The male sterile inbred line may be crossed with a male fertile inbred line resulting in hybrid seeds, whereby the plants grown therefrom possess the properties of low pungency and high SSC.   [0084] Likewise open pollinated, long-day onion plants comprising low pungency and high SSC can be made. Thus, onion plants according to the invention may be maintained as open pollinated lines, half-sib lines, male sterile lines, female sterile lines, etc. Male sterile inbred lines of onion plants according to the invention are useful as parents for producing hybrids.     [0085] In another aspect, a method for producing an onion crop from onion seeds or plants according to the invention and long day onions harvested therefrom is provided.   [0086] The following non-limiting examples illustrate the production of onion plants, seeds and bulbs according to the invention. All references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference.     EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 - Plant Development [0087] Plants have been obtained by a long term breeding program (Oregon, USA) in which numerous plants have been analyzed for the desired combination of the traits as mentioned.     [0088] The initial cross concerned low pungency / low SSC onion plants (the commercially available long-day variety Ailsa Craig) with high pungency / high SSC long-day onion plants of a breeding line designated 137787B and subsequent selfing of the Fl plants to create variable F2 populations. No Spanish background was used.   [0089] A selected F2 individual (phenotyped for pungency and SSC) was crossed to an individual selected from a breeding line derived from the variety Oregon Danvers Yellow Globe. Plants from this cross where selfed and selected individuals from this progeny were selfed again. A low pungency, high SSC line was obtained and designated 137554.   [0090] Six additional cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection were made, with selection for the phenotypes high SSC and low pungency and having all desirable agronomic traits and long day length photoperiod response. High SSC was determined using refractometry analysis according to the method of Mann and Hoyle, 1945 (Proc. Americ. Soc. Hort. Sci. 46: 285-292) or Foskett and Peterson, 1949 (Proc.  Americ. Soc. Hort. Sci. 55: 314-318). Pungency was determined using the PAD measurement of Schwimmer and Weston 1961 (supra). Throughout the scheme plants in each generation were selected after approximately 150 days of storage, i.e., PAD  and/or SSC measurements were made after about 5 to 6 months of storage for selection purposes. [0091] Coincident with the six cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection the selected plants were crossed and backcrossed to cytoplasmic/nuclear male sterile plants. In this way inbred maintainer line 137554B and its male sterile companion line 137554A  were developed, both of which have lower pungency and higher SSC at harvest and after storage and are long day onions. Seeds of 137554 (137554A and 137554B) have been deposited at the ATCC under the Budapest Treaty under accession number PTA-and PTA-9055, respectively.   [0092] Line 137853B was developed by further breeding and selection with the above material and seeds of 137853B were deposited at the ATCC under the Budapest Treaty under accession number PTA-9053. Line 137853B has even lower pungency than 137554A and B and has improved bulb quality.   [0093] From these plants parent lines for producing hybrid varieties have been developed by additional crossing and further inbreeding while selecting for agronomic traits and good combining ability. The hybrid varieties produced with these lines have been evaluated for the unique combination of low pungency / high soluble solids, long storage and other desirable agronomic characteristics.   [0094] In one aspect of the invention, novel plants, seeds and bulbs of long-day onion 137554A or B and of 137853B are provided. Also, hybrids produced from crossing 137554A or B and 137853B are provided, as well as plants produced from such crosses or selfings and which produce bulbs comprising low pungency, high SSC and/or high storage capabilities.     EXAMPLE 2 - Plant 137554 Having Low Pungency and High SSC     [0095] Table 1 below shows (average) pungency measured as pyruvate concentration in  Mol/g FW and SSC content (%) of bulbs of the plant designated 137554A and the commercially available Long Day variety Granero 9536, both at harvest and during 3 months of storage.     Table 1 Time Period* Pyruvate (pMol/g FW) SSC (%) Granero 137554 Granero 137554 1 6,22 4,92 8,6 8,3 2 5,95 5,34 9,3 8,5 3 5,91 5,5 9,7 8,9 4 6,92 6,17 8,3 8,1 8,66 5,78 9,4 8,1 6 9,07 3,33 8,4 8,2 7 8,53 4,89 8,1 7,5 8 9,97 4,62 8,5 7,4 * The time periods are approximately two weeks apart.   [0096] The Example shows that during storage pyruvate levels of Granero, a long day Spanish hybrid variety which is pungent and has high SSC, increases significantly, while the pungency of 137554A does not change significantly and the SSC levels remain high and constant. Also, at harvest 137554A, combines low pungency with high SSC (and long day characteristics).     [0097] Table 2 shows yield and percent storage decay of 137554A compared to commercial pungent and high SSC varieties Granero and Nebula (136 days after harvest, i.e., after about 4.5 months of storage). Percent decay was assessed by weight.

Even after more than 6 months of storage the average pungency remains very low and average SSC remains high. Also, the pungency range is narrow (min. 1.29, max.  4.85).     EXAMPLE 5 - Line 137853B [00101] Table 4 shows single bulb pungency levels of line 137853B after 5-6 months of storage showing that very low pungency (mean pungency 2.3 iMol/g FW) has been achieved, combined with high SSC.
