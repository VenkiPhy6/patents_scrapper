 The invention also relates to compositions comprising the recombinant enzyme, oral care compositions and products and the use for removing of dental plaque. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dextranases are a-1,6-glucanases 3.2.1.11), also known as 1,6-a-D-glucan 6-glucanohydrolases, which degrade the a-l,6-glycosidic linkages in dextran. 
 Dextranases are known to be useful for a number of applications including the use as ingredient in dentifrice for prevent dental caries, plaque and/or tartar and for hydrolysis of raw sugar juice or syrup of sugar canes and sugar beets. 
 Several micro-organisms are known to be capable of producing dextranases, among them fungi of the genera Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Spicaria, Verticillium, Helminthosporium and Chaetomium; bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Cellvibrio, Cytophaga, Brevibacterium, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Arthrobacter and Flavobacterium, and yeasts such as Lipomyces starkeyi. 
 A commercially available dextranase, sold as an industrial enzyme for breaking down raw sugar juice, is Dextranase from Novo Nordisk produced by fermentation of a strain of Paecilomyces sp.. 
 Below are summarised prior art documents concerning dextranase and applications thereof.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is to provide a recombinant dextranase from Paecilomyces lilacinus by heterologous production in a filamentous fungi host cell. 
 The present inventors have as the first cloned the complete DNA sequence encoding an enzyme with dextranase activity from Paecilomyces lilacinus and produced it heterologously in a filamentous fungi host cell. Said enzyme has previously only been produced homologously in Paecilomyces lilacinus. Consequently, according to prior art the enzyme product comprising said enzyme with dextranase activity is produced together with a mixture of other enzyme activities. It is advantageous to be able to produce a recombinant dextranase heterologously in a suitable host, as it is possible to provide a single component dextranase. Further, it facilitates providing an isolated and purified enzyme of the invention in industrial scale. 
 In the context of the present invention the term "heterologous" production means expression of a recombinant enzyme in a host organism different from the original donor organism. 
 The term "homologous" production means expression of the wild-type enzyme by the original organism. 
 The complete DNA sequence, shown in SEQ ID NO. 1, encoding the dextranase of the invention, comprised in the plasmid pToc325, has been transformed into the bacteria strain Escherichia coli DH5ca. The strain is deposited at DSM under the number DSM 10706. This will be described further below. 
 By a database alignment search it was found that the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 1 is novel. The highest degree of homology found was 59% to the above mentioned Penicillium minioluteum (MUCL No. 38929) deposited on 2 2 nd of August 1994 under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty with the Mycotheque de l'Universit6 Catholique de Louvain (MUCL). The DNA and amino acid sequences are disclosed in EP 0 663 443. 
 20 In the first aspect the invention relates to a DNA construct comprising a DNA i. sequence encoding an enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity, which DNA sequence comprises a) the dextranase encoding part of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 1, and/or the dextranase encoding part of the DNA sequence obtainable from E. coli DSM 25 10706, or b) an analogue of the DNA sequence shown defined in a) which i) is 80% homologous with the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 1 and/or the DNA sequence obtainable from E. coli DSM 10706, or ii) encodes a polypeptide which is at least 80% homologous with the polypeptide encoded by a DNA sequence comprising the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 1 and/or the DNA sequence obtainable from E. coli DSM 10706. 
 In the present context, the "analogue" of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 1 and/or the DNA sequence obtainable from E. coli DSM 10706, is intended to indicate any DNA sequence encoding an enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity, which has at least one of Ahe properties i)-ii).

 [R:kLIBAA]079,8.doc:tab The analogous DNA sequence may be isolated from another or related the same) organism producing the enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity on the basis of a partial sequence of the DNA sequences shown in SEQ ID NO. 1 and/or obtainable from E. coli, DSM 10706, e.g. using the procedures described herein, and thus, e.g. be an allelic or species variant of the DNA sequence shown herein, may be constructed on the basis of any partial DNA sequence of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 1, e.g. by introduction of nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the dextranase encoded by the DNA sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions which may give rise to a different amino acid sequence. However, in the latter case amino acid changes are preferably of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the polypeptide, small deletions, typically of one to about 30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues, or a small extension that facilitates purification, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain. See in general Ford et al., (1991), Protein Expression and Purification 2, 95-107. 
 oo 9**o [R:\LIBAA]07918 .doc:tab WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 Examples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (such as arginine, lysine, histidine), acidic amino acids (such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (such as glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (such as leucine, isoleucine, valine), aromatic amino acids (such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) and small amino acids (such as glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, methionine). 
 It will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that such substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the molecule and still result in an active enzyme. Amino acids essential to the activity of the polypeptide encoded by the DNA construct of the invention, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, (1989), Science 244, 1081-1085). In the latter technique mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resulting mutant molecules are tested for biological dextranase) activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. 
 Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of crystal structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography or photoaffinity labelling. See, for example, de Vos et al. (1992), Science 255, 306-312; Smith et al., (1992), J. Mol. Biol., 224, 899-904; Wlodaver et al., (1992), FEBS Lett., 309, 59-64. 
 It will be understood that any partial DNA sequence within the protein coding part of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 
 1 and/or the DNA sequence transformed into the deposited strain E. coli DSM 10706 may be used for isolating the entire DNA sequence encoding the recombinant dextranase of the invention. 
 The amino acid sequence (as deduced from the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 1) is shown in SEQ ID no. 2. 
 The homology referred to in i) above is determined as the degree of identity between the two sequences indicating a derivation of the first sequence from the second. The homology may suitably be determined by means of computer programs known WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 6 in the art such as GAP provided in the GCG program package (Needleman, S.B. and Wunsch, (1970), Journal of Molecular Biology, 48, p. 443-453). Using GAP (version 8) with the following settings for DNA sequence comparison: GAP creation penalty of 5.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.3, the coding region of the DNA sequence exhibits a degree of identity preferably of at least 80%, such as at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, especially at least 99%, with the coding region of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID No. 1 or the DNA sequence i0 obtainable from the plasmid in E. coli DSM 10706. 
 The hybridization referred to in ii) above is intended to indicate that the analogous DNA sequence hybridizes to the same probe as the DNA sequence encoding the dextranase under certain specified conditions which are described in detail in the Materials and Methods section hereinafter. 
 Normally, the analogous DNA sequence is highly homologous to the DNA sequence such as at least 80% homologous to the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 1 or the DNA sequence obtainable from the plasmid in E. coli DSM 10706 encoding a dextranase of the invention, such as at least 90%, preferably at least such as at least 99% homologous to said DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 1 and/or the DNA sequence obtainable from the plasmid in E. coli DSM 10706. 
 The homology referred to in iii) above is determined as the degree of identity between the two sequences indicating a derivation of the first sequence from the second. The homology may suitably be determined by means of computer programs known in the art such as GAP provided in the GCG program package (Needleman, S.B. and Wunsch, (1970), Journal of Molecular Biology, 48, p. 443-453). Using GAP with the following settings for DNA sequence comparison: GAP creation penalty of 5.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.3, the coding region of the DNA sequence exhibits a degree of identity preferably of at least such as at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, especially at least 99%, with the coding region of the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 1 and/or the DNA sequence obtainable from the plasmid in E. coli DSM 10706. 
 WO 98/00529 PCT/DK9700284 7 The term "derived from" in connection with property iv) above is intended not only to indicate a dextranase produced by a strain of DSM 10706, but also a dextranase encoded by a DNA sequence isolated from strain DSM 10706 and produced in a host organism transformed with said DNA sequence. The immunological reactivity may be determined by the method described in the "Materials and Methods" section below. 
 In further aspects the invention relates to an expression vector harbouring a DNA construct of the invention, a cell comprising the DNA construct or expression vector and a method of producing an enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity which method comprises culturing said cell under conditions permitting the production of the enzyme, and recovering the enzyme from the culture. 
 It is also an object of the invention to provide an enzyme preparation enriched with the recombinant dextranase of the invention. 
 Further, the invention provides an oral care composition which further comprises an enzyme exhibiting an enzyme activity selected from the group of mutanases, oxidases, peroxidases, haloperoxidases, laccases, proteases, endoglucosidases, lipases, amylases, anti-microbial enzymes, and mixtures thereof. 
 Finally the invention relates to the use of the recombinant dextranase of the invention. The enzyme of the invention or a composition of the invention comprising such an enzyme may be used for preventing dental caries, plaque or/and tartar. 
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Cloning The DNA sequence coding for an enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity of the invention may conveniently be isolated from DNA from a suitable source, such as any of the below mentioned organisms, by use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes prepared on the basis of a DNA sequence disclosed herein. 
 For instance, a suitable oligonucleotide probe may be prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ ID no. 1 and/or the nucleotide sequence obtainable from the WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 8 plasmid in E. coli DSM 10706, or the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID no. 2 or any suitable sub-sequence thereof. 
 According to this method primers able to code for these peptides, being a part of SEQ ID No. 2, are designed. Fragments of the gene to be cloned is then PCR amplified by the use of these primers. These fragments are used as probes for cloning the complete gene. 
 A more detailed description of the screening method is given in Example 1 and 2 below. 
 Alternatively, the DNA sequence of the invention encoding an enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity may be isolated by a general method involving cloning, in suitable vectors, a DNA library from Paecilomyces lilacinus, transforming suitable host cells with said vectors, culturing the host cells under suitable conditions to express any enzyme of interest encoded by a clone in the DNA library, screening for positive clones by determining any dextranase activity of the enzyme produced by such clones, and isolating the DNA coding an enzyme from such clones. 
 The general method is further disclosed in WO 93/11249 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. 
 The DNA sequence coding for the recombinant dextranase of the invention may for instance be isolated by screening a cDNA library of the donor organism, and selecting for clones expressing the appropriate enzyme activity dextranase activity as defined by the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyse AZCL- Dextran). The appropriate DNA sequence may then be isolated from the clone by standard procedures. 
 Depositing of the dextranase sequence The complete full length DNA sequence obtained from a strain of Paecilomyces lilacinus encoding the dextranase of the invention has been transformed into a strain of the bacteria E. 
 coli DH5a, comprised in the plasmid pUC19. Said bacteria has been deposited by the inventors according to the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of 9 Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure at the Deutshe Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH., Mascheroder Weg Ib, D-38124 Braunschweig Federal Republic of Germany, (DSM). 
 Deposit date June 6, 1996 Depositor's ref. NN49245 ToC 1065 DSM designation E. coli DSM no. 10706 Being an International Depository Authority under the Budapest Treaty, Deutshe Sammlung von Mikroorganisem und Zellkulturren GmbH., affords permanence of the deposit in accordance with the rules and regulations of said treaty, vide in particular Rule 9. Access to the deposit will be available during the pendency of this patent application to one determined by the Commisioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to be entitled thereto under 37 C.F.R. Par. 1.14 and 35 U.S.C. Par. 122. Also, the above mentioned deposits fulfil the requirements of European patent applications relating to micro-organisms according to Rule 28 EPC. 
 The above mentioned deposit represents a substantially pure culture of the isolated bacteria. The deposit is available as required by foreign patent laws in countries wherein counterparts of the subject application, or its progeny are filed. However, it should be understood that the availability of the deposited strain does not constitute a license to practice the subject invention in derogation of patent rights granted by governmental 20 action. 
 The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme exhibiting dextranase activity can for instance be isolated from the above mentioned deposited strain by standard methods. 
 Microbial Sources It is expected that a DNA sequence coding for a homologous enzyme, i.e. an analogous DNA sequence, is obtainable from other micro-organisms, such as the following filamentous fungi, yeasts or bacteria. For instance, the DNA sequence may be derived from a strain of Paecilomyces, such as Paecilomyces *woo: o [n:/libc]00224:bmv WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 lilacinus, or a strain of Penicillium, such as Penicillium lilacinum or Penicillium minioluteum, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Spicaria, Verticillium, Helminthosporium or Chaetomium; bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Cellvibrio, Cytophaga, Brevibacterium, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Arthrobacter and Flavobacterium; yeasts, such as Lipomyces starkeyi. 
 Production of the dextranase The DNA sequence encoding the dextranase may subsequently be inserted into a recombinant expression vector. This may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. 
 Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extra-chromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. 
 In the vector, the DNA sequence encoding the dextranase should be operably connected to a suitable promoter and terminator sequence. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the dextranase, the promoter and the terminator, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors are well known to persons skilled in the art for instance, Sambrook et al., (1989), Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). 
 The host cell which is transformed with the DNA sequence encoding the dextranase is preferably a filamentous fungus cell. In particular, the cell may belong to a species of Aspergillus, most preferably Aspergillus oryzae or Aspergillus niger, or a strain of Fusarium, such as a strain of Fusarium oxysporium, Fusarium graminearum (in the perfect state named WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 11 Gribberella zeae, previously Sphaeria zeae, synonym with Gibberella roseum and Gibberella roseum f. sp. cerealis), or Fusarium sulphureum (in the prefect state named Gibberella puricaris, synonym with Fusarium trichothecioides, Fusarium bactridioides, Fusarium sambucium, Fusarium roseum, and Fusarium roseum var. graminearum), Fusarium cerealis (synonym with Fusarium crokkwellnse), or Fusarium venenatum. 
 The host cell may advantageously be a F. graminearum described in WO 96/00787 (from Novo Nordisk e.g. the strain deposited as Fusarium graminearum ATCC 20334. The strain ATCC 20334 was previously wrongly classified as Fusarium graminearum (Yoder, W. and Christianson, L. 1997). RAPD-based and classical taxonomic analyses have now revealed that the true identity of the Quorn fungus, ATCC 20334, is Fusarium venenatum Nirenburg sp. nov. 
 In the Examples below expression of dextranase is illustrated using A. oryzae and F. venenatum as host cells. 
 In a preferred embodiment of the invention the host cell is a protease deficient of protease minus strain. 
 This may for instance be the protease deficient strain Aspergillus oryzae JaL125 having the alkaline protease gene named "alp" deleted. This strain is described in PCT/DK97/00135 (from Novo Nordisk A/S). 
 Filamentous fungi cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation and transformation of the protoplasts followed by regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se. The use of Aspergillus as a host microorganism is described in EP 238 023 (Novo Nordisk the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. 
 A method of producing an enzyme of the invention In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of producing an enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is cultured under conditions permitting the production of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the culture. 
 WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 12 The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed dextranase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered there from by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulphate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like. 
 The Enzyme The invention also relates to an isolated recombinant enzyme with dextranase activity having essentially an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID no. 2 or a fragment of the same. Mass spectrometry showed that the average mass of the recombinant dextranase is about 65.3 kD. 
 The pH optimum of the recombinant dextranase was found to lie in the range from 3.5 to 5.5 which equals the pH optimum of the wild-type dextranase (see Figure The temperature optimum of both the recombinant and wild-type dextranase was found to be around 60 0 C at pH 5.5 (see Figure Further, the recombinant and wild-type dextranases were stabile at 60 0 C at pH 5.5 and pH 7. At 70 0 C only little residual activity was observed. 
 Oral care composition In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to an oral care composition useful as ingredient in oral care products. 
 An oral care composition of the invention may suitably comprise an amount of the recombinant Paecilomyces lilacinus dextranase equivalent to an enzyme activity, calculated as enzyme activity units in the final oral care product, in the range from 0.001 KDU to 1000 KDU/ml, preferably from 0.01 KDU/ml to 500 KDU/ml, especially from 0.1 KDU/ml to 100 KDU/ml.

It is also possible to employ mixtures of these substances. 
 Dependent on the oral care product the abrasive product may be present in from 0 to 70% by weight, preferably from 1% to For toothpastes the abrasive material content typically lies in the range of from 10% to 70% by weight of the final toothpaste product. 
 Humectants are employed to prevent loss of water from e.g.

 Enzymes Other essential components used in oral care products and in oral care products of the invention are enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts of chemical reactions in living systems. 
 Enzymes combine with the substrates on which they act forming an intermediate enzyme-substrate complex. This complex is then converted to a reaction product and a liberated enzyme which continue its specific enzymatic function. 
 Enzymes provide several benefits when used for cleansing of the oral cavity. Proteases break down salivary proteins, which are adsorbed onto the tooth surface and form the pellicle, the first layer of resulting plaque. Proteases along with lipases destroy bacteria by lysing proteins and lipids which form the structural components of bacterial cell walls and membranes. 
 Dextranase breaks down the organic skeletal structure produced by bacteria that forms a matrix for bacterial adhesion. Proteases and amylases, not only prevents plaque formation, but also prevents the development of calculus by breaking-up the carbohydrate-protein complex that binds calcium, preventing mineralization.

 Fusarium CC1-3: A morphological mutant of Fusarium (ATCC 20334) (Wiebe et al., 1992, Mycological Research 96: 555- 562; Wiebe et al., 1991, Mycological Research 95: 1284-1288; Wiebe et al., 1991, Mycological Research 96: 555-562) is a WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 19 highly branched, colonial variant. Strain ATTC 20334 is the strain referred to in WO 96/00787 as Fusarium graminearum ATTC 20334. Strain ATTC 20334 was previously wrongly classified as F. graminearum (Yoder and Christianson, (1997). RAPD-based and classical taxonomic analyses reveal the true identity of the Quorn fungus, ATCC 20334, to be Fusarium venenatum Nirenburg sp. nov.

 Conditions: 2.5% Dextran 500 (Pharmacia) in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4 at 400C. Enzyme concentrations around 1 DU/ml. 
 1 DU equals the amount of enzyme that produces an amount of reducing sugars equivalent to 1 mg of maltose in 1 hour. 
 Dextranase activity can also be measured using AZCLdextran (MegaZyme). 500 tl 0.4 AZCL-dextran in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5 or 50 mM Britton-Robinson buffer is added 500 il enzyme sample diluted in MilliQ filtered H 2 0 and incubated for 10 minutes at 40 0 C. Then the samples are centrifuged for 2 minutes at 15,000g and 200 Al of supernatant is added to wells in a microtiter plate and the absorption at 595 nm is measured. 
 Molecular characterization of wild-type dextranase from Paecilomyces lilacinus Mass spectrometry Mass spectrometry of purified wild type dextranase is done using matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry in a VG Analytical TofSpec. For mass spectrometry 2 ml of sample is mixed with 2 ml saturated matrix solution (a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% TFA:acetonitrile (70:30)) and 2 ml of the mixture spotted onto the target plate. 
 Before introduction into the mass spectrometer the solvent is removed by evaporation. Samples are desorbed and ionised by 4 ns laser pulses (337 nm) at threshold laser power and accelerated WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 22 into the field-free flight tube by an accelerating voltage of kV. Ions are detected by a microchannel plate set at 1850 V. 
 Preparation of hydroxyapatite disks (HA) Hydroxyapatite tablets are prepared by compressing 250 mg of hydroxyapatite in a tablet die at about 5,900 kg (13,000 lbs) of pressure for 5 minutes. The tablets are then sintered at 600 0 
 C 
 for 4 hours and finally hydrated with sterile deionized water. 
 Plaque coating of Hydroxyapatite disks (HA) Hydroxyapatite disks (HA) were dry sterilised (1210C, 2 bar, 20 minutes) and coated with filter sterilised saliva for 18 hours at 37 0 C. The HA disks were placed in a sterile rack in a beaker, Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) containing 0.2% sucrose was poured into the beaker covering the disks. Sterile Na 2 S (pH was added immediately before inoculation given the final concentration of 5 g/litre. A mixture 1:1:1 of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Fusobacterium nucleatum grown anaerobically (BHI, 37 0 C, 24 hour) was used as inoculum in the concentration of approximately 106 cfu/ml. The disks were incubated anaerobic at 37 0 C for 4 days with slight stirring. 
 Malthus-method for plaque The Malthus-method is based on the methods described in Johnston et al., (1995), Journal of Microbiological Methods 21, p. 15-26 and Johansem et al. (1995), Journal of Applied Bacteriology 78, p. 297-303.

 EXAMPLES 
 Example 1 s Purification of wild-type dextranase Step 1: Ultra-filtration 1 litre Dextranase 50 L (Novo Nordisk A/S) was mixed with 8 litre 50 mM Na-acetate/HC1, pH 5.4. The mixture was concentrated to approximately 0.5 litre on a 10 kDa cut-off ultra-filtration cassette (Alpha Minisette from Filtron). 
 Another 8 litre 50 mM Na-acetate/HCl, pH 5.4 was added and the enzyme was again concentrated to approx. 0.5 litre. 
 Step 2: Chromatoqraphy on Phenyl-sepharose  
 FF 
 Saturated ammonium sulphate was added to give a final ammonium sulphate concentration of 1.OM. The pH was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 3% NaOH and the enzyme was filtered on a Seitz EK1 filter plate. The EK1-filtrate was divided in two halves. 
 A 1 litre Phenyl-sepharose FF (high sub) column was equilibrated in 25mM Na-acetate/HC1, 1.OM (NH 4 2 
 SO 
 4 pH 6.0. One half of the EKl-filtrate was applied to the column and the column was washed with 5 column volumes of equilibration buffer to remove non-binding proteins. To elute the dextranase an ammonium sulphate gradient (1.OM O.OM) over 5 column volumes was applied to the column. The Phenyl-sepharose  
 FF 
 column step was repeated with the other half of the EKIfiltrate. Fractions with dextranase activity were pooled. 
 Step 3: Chromatoqraphv on O-sepharose FF The pooled fractions were concentrated on a 10 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration cassette to approx. 250ml. The ultrafiltrated enzyme was dialyzed against 10mM Na-acetate/HCl, pH 6.0 with several buffer changes. 
 A 1 litre Q-sepharose FF column was equilibrated in Na-acetate/HCl, pH 6.0. The enzyme was applied to the column and the column was washed with equilibration buffer until the 
 OD 
 28 0 signal had returned to baseline. The dextranase enzyme WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 24 was eluted with a linear NaC1 gradient (0 75mM) over five column volumes. 
 Fractions from the column were analyzed for dextranase activity and fractions with dextranase activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions which were judged to be at least pure were pooled as the purified Dextranase. Finally the enzyme was filtered through a 0.20 p filter.

 Example 3 Cloning of the dextranase gene from Paecilomyces lilacinus. 
 The cloning of the dextranase gene from Paecilomyces lilacinus was based on the knowledge of the partial amino acid sequence described in Example 2. Degenerate PCR primers able to code for peptide 3, 4 and 6 were designed. Primers coding for the same sequences in both orientations were made. All combinations of the six primers were used in PCR reactions with chromosomal DNA from Paecilomyces lilacinus. Some of these reactions resulted in DNA fragments which coded for parts of the dextranase genes. These fragment were used as probes on a genomic Southern. A 6kb BamHI fragment hybridized and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. All in vitro DNA work was done following standard procedures (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989)) PCR fragments The following primers were synthesized.

Primers 8003 and 8004 encode amino acids no. 5-11 of peptide no. 4 and primers 8005 and 8006 encode amino acids no. 1-6 of peptide no. 6. 
 Chromosomal DNA from Paecilomyces lilacinus Li-3 was prepared essential as described by Yelton et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. 
 Sci., (1984), 81, p. 1470-1474). 
 PCR reactions were run according to standard procedures with all combinations of primers. The primer sets 8001/8006 and 8003/8002 gave fragments that upon cloning in the vector pCRII (Invitrogen TA Cloning Kit) and sequencing on an Applied WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 27 Biosystems DNA Sequencer were shown to contain parts of the dextranase gene. The fragment obtained with the primer-set 8001/8006 was approximately 0.9 kb. Sequencing of the ends of this fragment revealed a DNA sequence encoding peptide no. 2. 
 The fragment obtained with 8003/8002 were approximately 0.6 kb. Sequencing revealed that sequences encoding peptide 1 and 8 were contained in this fragment. 
 Genomic clone A Southern blot of chromosomal DNA from Paecilomyces lilacinus cut with BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, Sall, XbaI and Xhol was made and hybridized with the 32 P labelled PCR fragments. Both fragments hybridized to an approximately 6 kb BamHI fragment. A library of approximately 6 kb BamHI fragments from Paecilomyces lilacinus cloned into pUC19 was made. The library was screened by colony hybridization with one of the PCR fragments and a positive plasmid pToC325 (See Figure 2) was isolated. 2994bp of pToC325 were sequenced, the DNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID No. 1 and SEQ ID No. 2, respectively. pToC325 transformed into E. 
 coli DH5a was deposited at DSM as strain no. 10706 Example 4 Expression of recombinant dextranase in Aspergillus oryzae. 
 Restriction enzyme sites were introduced at the start and stop codon of the dextranase by which the gene was cloned into an A. oryzae expression vector, pCaHj483. The resulting dextranase expression plasmid was transformed into an A. oryzae strain. Transformants were isolated and analyzed for the expression of dextranase. 
 Construction of pCaHi483. 
 pCaHj483 (see Figure 1) was build from the following fragments: a) The vector pToC65 (W091/17243) cut with EcoRI and XbaI. 
 b) A 2.7 kb XbaI fragment from A. nidulans carrying the amdS gene M. Corrick et al. (1987), Gene 53, 63-71). The amdS gene is used as a selective marker in fungal transformations. 
 The amdS gene has been modified so that the BamHI site normally WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 28 present in the gene is destroyed. This has been done by introducing a silent point mutation using the primer AGAAATCGGGTATCCTTTCAG- 3' (see SEQ ID No. 21) c) A 0.6 kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment carrying the A. niger NA2 s promoter fused to a 60bp DNA fragment of the sequence encoding the 5" un-translated end of the mRNA of the A. 
 nidulans tpi gene. The NA2 promoter was isolated from the plasmid pNA2 (EP-B-0 383 779 from Novo Nordisk A/S) and fused to the 60 bp tpi sequence by PCR. The primer encoding the bp tpi sequence had the following sequence: GGATAGAGGTAAATTGAGTTGGAAACTCCAAGCATGGCATCCTTGC- 3' (See SEQ ID No. 22) d) A 675 bp XbaI fragment carrying the A. niger glucoamylase transcription terminator. The fragment was isolated from the plasmid pICAMG/Term (EP 238 023 from Novo Nordisk A/S). 
 The BamHI site of fragment c was connected to the XbaI site in front of the transcription terminator on fragment d via the pIC19R linker (BamHI to XbaI) Cloning of dextranase into pCaHi483. 
 BamHI and a XhoI sites were introduced in front of the ATG and rigth after the stop codon of the dextranase gene by PCR with the following primers 8864 CGCGGATCCACCATGCGTTGGCCTGGTAATTTTC (SEQ ID No. 23) 8867 CCGCTCGAGCCTGCCTCATTCAATGCTCC (SEQ ID No. 24) The gene was re-sequenced to check for PCR errors and cloned via the BamHI and XhoI sites into the expression vector pCaHj483. The resulting dextranase expression plasmid was named pToC343 and is depicted in Figure 3. 
 A. oryzae transformants of pToC343. 
 A. oryzae JaL 125 was transformed with pToC343 as described in EP 0 238 023. Transformants were selected by their ability to use acetamide as the only nitrogen source. After two re-isolations through conidiospores on minimal acetamid plates the transformants were fermented for four days at 30 0 C in 10 ml YPD. Samples of the fermentation broth were applied to SDS- WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 29 PAGE. The gels were stained by croomasie brillant blue. A band of approximately 65 kD was visible in the broth from the transformants and not in the broth from JaL125. 
 Three transformants producing the 65 kD protein were fermented in a 2 liter Kieler fermenter for five days in a maltodextrin containing medium and the content of dextranase was determined enzymatically. 
 The transformant produced up to 11.000 DU/ml in the fermentation broth, the un-transformed host produced less than 100 DU/ml. 
 Example Purification of recombinant dextranase: Culture broth was filtered and concentrated in an Amicon cell (membrane cut off: 10 kDa). The sample was diluted with MilliQ filtered H 2 0 and pH was adjusted to pH 7.5. The sample was then loaded on to a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 and the dextranase was eluted in a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaC1 in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Dextranase-containing fractions were pooled, added (NH 4 2 
 SO 
 4 to a concentration of 1 M and loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 1 M (NH 4 2 
 SO 
 4 The dextranase was eluted in a linear gradient of 1 to 0 M (NH 4 2 
 SO 
 4 The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified recombinant dextranase was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing. Actually two N-terminal amino acid sequences were found; one beginning at Aspl (Asp-Gln-Gln-Asn-Gln-) and one beginning at Asn4 (Asn-Gln-) in a ratio of 2:3. 
 Example 6 Molecular weight of dextranase The purified recombinant dextranase like the wild-type enzyme had a molecular weight of around 65 kDa from SDS-PAGE. 
 This was confirmed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, where a molecular weight around 65 kDa was observed. 
 WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 Mass spectrometry of the wild-type dextranase revealed an average mass around 65.3 kDa. 
 Example 7 pH-profile of recombinant and wild-type dextranase: Enzyme samples were incubated with AZCL-dextran in 50 mM Britton-Robinson buffer at various pH. Both recombinant and the wild-type dextranase have a pH optimum around pH 6 (see Figure 4). 
 Example 8 Temperature profile of recombinant and wild-type dextranase: Enzyme samples were incubated with AZCL-dextran in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5 at various temperatures. The recombinant and the wild-type enzyme has similar temperature profiles with an optimum around 60 0 C (see Figure Example 9 Temperature stability of recombinant and wild-type dextranase: Enzyme samples were pre-incubated at various temperatures in 50 mM Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 5.5 or pH 7 for minutes. Then the samples were diluted 10 fold in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5 before measuring the residual activity. A comparable temperature stability was obtained for the two enzymes at both pH 5.5 and pH 7. The dextranase is stable at 0 C. After incubation at 70 0 C little residual activity is observed (see Figure 6). 
 Example Recombinant dextranase against Dental Plaque A plaque biofilm was grown anaerobic on saliva coated hydroxyapatite disks as described in the Materials and Methods section above. The plaque was a mixed culture of Streptococcus mutans (SFAG, CBS 350.71), Actinomyces viscosus (DSM no. 43329) and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum (DSM no. 20482). 
 HA disks with plaque were transferred to acetate buffer (pH containing 1 KDU/ml recombinant Paecilomyces lilacinus WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 31 dextranase and whirled for 2 minutes (sterile buffer was used as control). 
 After enzyme treatment, the HA disks were either DAPI stained or transferred to Malthus cells. 
 Indirect impedance measurements were used when enumerating living adherent cells (Malthus Flexi M2060, Malthus Instrument Limited). 
 For the impedance measurements 3 ml of BHI were transferred to the outer chamber of the indirect Malthus cells, and 0.5 ml of sterile KOH (0.1 M) was transferred to the inner chamber. The HA disks with plaque were after dextranase treatment slightly rinsed with phosphate buffer and transferred to the outer chamber. The detection times (dt) in Malthus were converted to colony counts by use of a calibration curve relating cfu/ml to dt (See Figure 7). 
 The calibration curve was constructed by a series dilution rate prepared from the mixed culture. Conductance dt of each dilution step was determined in BHI and a calibration curve relating cfu/ml of the 10 fold dilutions to dt in BHI was constructed for the mixed culture The removal of plaque from the HA disks was also determined by fluorescent microscopy, disks were after enzyme treatment stained with DAPI (3 mM) and incubated in the dark for 5 minutes at 20 0 C. The DAPI stained cells were examined with the x 100 oil immersion fluorescence objective on an Olympus model microscope equipped with a 200 W mercury lamp and an UV- filter. 
 The result was compared with the quantitative data obtained by the impedance measurements. 
 The number of living cells on the saliva treated HA-surface was after the dextranase treatment determined by the Malthus method and shown in Table 1. 
 However, by the Malthus method it is not possible to distinguish between a bactericidal activity of the enzyme or an enzymatic removal of the plaque. Therefore a decrease in living bacteria on the surface has to be compared with the simultaneously removal of plaque from the surface which is estimated by the DAPI staining. 
 WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 Dextranase Loglo Removal of No. of (KDU/ml) reduction plaque observations (cfu/cm 2 0 0 0 1 2.5 99 3 Table 1: Enzymatic plaque removal (pH 5.5, 2 minutes) from saliva treated hydroxyapatite determined by impedance measurements. 
 A significant removal of plaque was determined by fluorescent microscopy after treatment with dextranase. Thus the recombinant dextranase reduced the amount of adhering cells. 
 Consequently, the activity was observed as a removal of plaque and not as a bactericidal activity against cells in plaque.

 Construction of dextranase expression plasmid for F. venenatum The dextranase gene was PCR amplified from the expression plasmid pToC343 using primers o-dexSwa (SEQ ID NO 25) and odexPac (SEQ ID NO 26)(see Materials and Methods). The resulting 1860 nt amplicon was digested with SwaI and PacI and ligated to pDM181 that had been linearized with the same two enzymes. The construct was introduced into E. coli and the resulting colonies were screened by colony hybridization to identify those that contained the dextranase coding region. From this screen, plasmid pJW111 was selected (Figure DNA sequencing of the insert in pJW1 determined that this was the dextranase gene and that the sequence was identical to that of the dextranase gene in pToC343. 
 Transformation of Fusarium venenatum The plasmid pJW111 was introduced into a morphological mutant of Fusarium A3/5 (ATCC 20334), designated CC1-3, as follows: WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 33 Conidia were generated by growth of strain ATTC 20334 CC1-3 in sporulation medium at 28 0 C, 150 rpm for 2-4 days. Conidia were filtered through Miracloth, concentrated by centrifugation and re-suspended in sterile water. 50 ml of YPG medium was inoculated with 108 conidia, and incubated for 14 hours at 24 0 C, 150 rpm. The resulting hyphae were resuspended in 20 ml of NOVOZYM 234 solution (2.5 mg/ml in 1.0 M MgSO 4 and digested for 15-45 minutes at 28 0 C at 80 rpm. 30 ml of STC were added and protoplasts were pelleted at 1500 rpm (Sorvall RT 6000 centrifuge) for 10 minutes. STC wash steps were repeated twice. Protoplasts were suspended in STC:SPTC:DMSO (8:2:0.1) at a concentration of approximately 5 X 107 protoplasts per ml. 
 Plasmid DNA (2-20 mg) was added to 200 ml protoplasts and incubated 30 minutes on ice. Two ml SPTC were added slowly, followed by a 20 minute incubation at room temperature. 50 ml melted overlay (lX Vogel's salts, 25mM NaNO3, 0.8M sucrose, 1% low melt agarose) at 40 0 C were added to the transformation reaction. Samples were mixed by inversion and split between two empty 150 mm petri dishes. After 24 hours 25 ml overlay plus 10 mg/ml Basta were added to each plate. Plates were incubated at room temperature. 
 Expression of dextranase activity 16 transformants were transferred to Vogel's/Basta and grown 7 days at room temperature. 20 ml M400Da medium in a 125 ml flask were inoculated with a 1 cm 2 piece of mycelia from the Vogel's/Basta plate. Cultures were incubated 7 days at 30 0 
 C, 
 150 rpm. Culture samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were assayed for dextranase (as described above). The best producing transformants were selected by dextranase activity assays and SDS/PAGE analysis. The dextranase band ran at approximately 60kD on a 10-27% gradient tris-glycine gel. 
 N-terminal sequencing revealed that the dextranase expressed in F. venenatum was 100% correctly processed to Asn-Gln-Ala-Leu-, in contrast to the dextranase produced by A. oryzae, of which WO 98/00529 PCT/DK97/00284 was incorrectly processed to yield the N-terminal sequence Asp-Gln-Gln-Asn-Gln-Ala-Leu-.
