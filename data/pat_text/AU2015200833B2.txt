 The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application number 2010317422, which claims priority from United States provisional application number 5 61/344,030, filed 11 May 2010 and United States patent application number 12/616,752, filed 11 November 2009, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 Introduction 
 The invention relates to a Bifidobacterium strain and its use as a probiotic bacteria in 10 particular as an immunomodulatory biotherapeutic agent. 
 The defense mechanisms to protect the human gastrointestinal tract from colonization by intestinal bacteria are highly complex and involve both immunological and non-immunological aspects (1). Innate defense mechanisms include the low pH of the stomach, 15 bile salts, peristalsis, mucin layers and anti-microbial compounds such as lysozyme (2). Immunological mechanisms include specialized lymphoid aggregates, underlying M cells, called peyers patches which are distributed throughout the small intestine and colon (3). Luminal antigens presented at these sites result in stimulation of appropriate T and B cell subsets with establishment of cytokine networks and secretion of antibodies into the 20 gastrointestinal tract (4). In addition, antigen presentation may occur via epithelial cells to intraepithelial lymphocytes and to the underlying lamina propria immune cells (5). Therefore, the host invests substantially in immunological defense of the gastrointestinal tract. However, as the gastrointestinal mucosa is the largest surface at which the host interacts with the external environment, specific control mechanisms must be in place to regulate immune 25 responsiveness to the 100 tons of food which is handled by the gastrointestinal tract over an average lifetime. Furthermore, the gut is colonized by over 500 species of bacteria numbering 10u-1012/g in the colon. Thus, these control mechanisms must be capable of distinguishing non-pathogenic adherent bacteria from invasive pathogens, which would cause significant damage to the host. In fact, the intestinal flora contributes to defense of the host by 30 competing with newly ingested potentially pathogenic micro-organisms. 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 la 
 Bacteria present in the human gastrointestinal tract can promote inflammation. Aberrant immune responses to the indigenous microflora have been implicated in certain disease states, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Antigens associated with the normal flora usually lead to 5 immunological tolerance and failure to achieve this tolerance is a major mechanism of mucosal inflammation (6). Evidence for this breakdown in tolerance includes an increase in antibody levels directed against the gut flora in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 10 The present invention is directed towards a Bifidobacterium strain which has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects, by modulating cytokine levels or by antagonizing and excluding pro-inflammatory micro-organisms from the gastrointestinal tract. 
 The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included in this 15 specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application. 20 Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof. 2 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 WO 2011/058535 PCT/IE2010/000066

 We describe Bifidobacterium strain AH1714 (NCIMB 41676) or mutants or variants thereof. The mutant may be a genetically modified mutant. The variant may be a naturally occurring variant of Bifidobacterium. Also described is a rifampicin resistant variant of strain AH 1714. The strain 5 may be a probiotic. It may be in the form of a biologically pure culture. 
 We also describe an isolated strain of Bifidobacterium NCIMB 41676. The Bifidobacterium strains may be in the form of viable cells. Alternatively Bifidobacterium strains are in the form of non-viable cells. The general use of probiotic bacteria is in the form of viable cells. However, 10 it can also be extended to non-viable cells such as killed cultures or compositions containing beneficial factors expressed by the probiotic bacteria. This could include thermally killed microorganisms or micro-organisms killed by exposure to altered pH or subjection to pressure or gamma irradiation. With non-viable cells product preparation is simpler, cells may be incorporated easily into pharmaceuticals and storage requirements are much less limited than 15 viable cells. Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 offers an example of the effective use of heat killed cells as a method for the treatment and/or prevention of tumour growth as described in US Patent No. US4347240. 
 The Bifidobacterium strains may be isolated from colonic biopsy tissue from healthy human 20 subjects, the Bifidobacterium strains being significantly immunomodulatory following oral consumption in humans.

The formulation may further comprise a protein and/or peptide, in particular proteins and/or peptides that are rich 30 in glutamine/glutamate, a lipid, a carbohydrate, a vitamin, mineral and/or trace element. The Bifidobacterium strain may be present in the formulation at more than 106 cfu per gram of delivery system. Preferably the formulation includes any one or more of an adjuvant, a bacterial component, a drug entity or a biological compound. PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 6 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 
 We also describe a Bifidobacterium strain or a formulation for use as foodstuffs, as a medicament, for use in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of undesirable inflammatory activity, for use in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of undesirable respiratory inflammatory activity such as asthma, for use in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of undesirable gastrointestinal 5 inflammatory activity such as inflammatory bowel disease eg.

 The Bifidobacterium strain may be used in the preparation of anti-inflammatory biotherapeutic agents for modifying the levels of IL-10. 
 The Bifidobacterium strain may be used as a anti-infective probiotic due to their ability to 30 antagonise the growth of pathogenic species. 
 We have found that particular strains of Bifidobacterium elicit immunomodulatory effects in vitro. PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 7 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 
 The invention is therefore of major potential therapeutic value in the prophylaxis or treatment of dysregulated immune responses, such as undesirable inflammatory reactions for example asthma. 5 Bifidobacterium are commensal microorganisms. They have been isolated from the microbial flora within the human gastrointestinal tract. The immune system within the gastrointestinal tract cannot have a pronounced reaction to members of this flora, as the resulting inflammatory activity would also destroy host cells and tissue function. Therefore, some mechanism(s) exist whereby the immune system can recognize commensal non-pathogenic members of the 10 gastrointestinal flora as being different to pathogenic organisms. This ensures that damage to host tissues is restricted and a defensive barrier is still maintained. A deposit of Bifidobacterium longum strain AH1714 was made at the National Collections of Industrial and Marine Bacteria Limited (NCIMB) Ferguson Building, Craibstone Estate, 15 Bucksbum, Aberdeen, AB21 9YA, Scotland, UK on November 5, 2009 and accorded the accession number NCIMB 41676. 
 The Bifidobacterium longum may be a genetically modified mutant or it may be a naturally occurring variant thereof. 20 
 Preferably the Bifidobacterium longum may be in the form of viable cells. 
 Alternatively the Bifidobacterium longum may be in the form of non-viable cells. 25 It will be appreciated that the specific Bifidobacterium strain of the invention may be administered to animals (including humans) in an orally ingestible form in a conventional preparation such as capsules, microcapsules, tablets, granules, powder, troches, pills, suppositories, suspensions and syrups. Suitable formulations may be prepared by methods commonly employed using conventional organic and inorganic additives. The amount of active 30 ingredient in the medical composition may be at a level that will exercise the desired therapeutic effect. 
 The formulation may also include a bacterial component, a drug entity or a biological compound. WO 2011/058535 PCT/IE2010/000066 8 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 
 In addition a vaccine comprising the strains of the invention may be prepared using any suitable known method and may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant. 
 Throughout the specification the terms mutant, variant and genetically modified mutant include a 5 strain of Bifidobacteria whose genetic and/or phenotypic properties are altered compared to the parent strain. Naturally occurring variant of Bifidobacterium longum includes the spontaneous alterations of targeted properties selectively isolated. Deliberate alteration of parent strain properties is accomplished by conventional (in vitro) genetic manipulation technologies, such as gene disruption, conjugative transfer, etc. Genetic modification includes introduction of 10 exogenous and/or endogenous DNA sequences into the genome of a Bifidobacteria strain, for example by insertion into the genome of the bacterial strain by vectors, including plasmid DNA, or bacteriophages. 
 Natural or induced mutations include at least single base alterations such as deletion, insertion, 15 transversion or other DNA modifications which may result in alteration of the amino acid sequence encoded by the DNA sequence. 
 The terms mutant, variant and genetically modified mutant also include a strain of Bifidobacteria that has undergone genetic alterations that accumulate in a genome at a rate which is consistent 20 in nature for all micro-organisms and/or genetic alterations which occur through spontaneous mutation and/or acquisition of genes and/or loss of genes which is not achieved by deliberate (in vitro) manipulation of the genome but is achieved through the natural selection of variants and/or mutants that provide a selective advantage to support the survival of the bacterium when exposed to environmental pressures such as antibiotics. A mutant can be created by the deliberate (in 25 vitro) insertion of specific genes into the genome which do not fundamentally alter the biochemical functionality of the organism but whose products can be used for identification or selection of the bacterium, for example antibiotic resistance. A person skilled in the art would appreciate that mutant or variant strains of Bifidobacteria can 30 be identified by DNA sequence homology analysis with the parent strain. Strains of Bifidobacteria having a close sequence identity with the parent strain are considered to be mutant or variant strains. A Bifidobacteria strain with a sequence identity (homology) of 96% or more, such as 97% or more, or 98% or more, or 99% or more with the parent DNA sequence may be considered to be a mutant or variant. Sequence homology may be determined using on-line PCME2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 9 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 homology algorithm “BLAST” program, publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih,gov/BLAST/. 
 Mutants of the parent strain also include derived Bifidobacteria strains having at least 85% 5 sequence homology, such as at least 90% sequence homology, or at least 95% sequence homology to the 16s - 23 s intergenic spacer polynucleotide sequence of the parent strain. These mutants may further comprise DNA mutations in other DNA sequences in the bacterial genome.

 The following examples further describe and demonstrate embodiments within the scope of the invention. The examples are given solely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be construed as limitations of the present invention, as many variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. 20 
 Example 1 - Isolation of Bifidobacterium loneum AH1714 
 Bifidobacterium longum strain AH1714 was isolated from colonic biopsy tissue from healthy human subjects. 25 Sections of the large of the human G.I.T, obtained during colorectal scoping, were screened for probiotic bacterial strains. Musocal tissue from the human gastrointestinal tract was transferred to a collection tube containing Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), supplemented with 0.05% cysteine-HCl). Triton X-100 (0.05%) was added to release the adherent microorganisms from the tissue sample. Tissue samples were then incubated for 10 min. The samples were vortexed 30 vigorously and adherent Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria isolated from the gastrointestinal tissue by plating on selective agar (De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar + Vancomycin and Wilkins-Chalgren Agar + Mupirocin, respectively). Isolated colonies were picked from the plates and re-streaked three times to ensure purity. Microscope examination, Gram staining, Catalase testing, Fructose-6-Phosphate Phosphoketolase assessment were used to determine PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 . 12 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 presumptive Bifidobacteria species and isolates were stocked in 40% glycerol and stored at -20o and -80oC. 16S intergenic spacer region sequencing were used to confirm the identity of the newly isolated strains. 5 Following isolation of a pure bifidobacteria strain, assigned the designation AH1714, microbiological characteristics were assessed and are summarized in Table 1 below. AH1714 is a gram positive, catalase negative pleomorphic shaped bacterium which is Fructose-6-Phoshate Phosphoketolase positive, confirming its identity as a bifidobacterium. 10 Table 1 - Phvsiochemical characteristics of B.loneum AH1714 
 Strain Characteristics B.longum AH1714 Gram Stain + Catalase - Motility - F6PPK* + 
 16s-23s intergenic spacer (IGS) sequencing was performed to identify the species of Bifidobacteria isolated. Briefly, DNA was isolated from AH1714 using 100 μΐ of Extraction Solution and 25 μΐ of Tissue Preparation solution (Sigma, XNAT2 Kit). The samples were 15 incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature followed by 2hrs at 95°C and then 100 μΐ of Neutralization Solution (Sigma, XNAT2 kit) was added. Genomic DNA solution was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and stored at 4°C. PCR was performed using the IGS primers. The primer pairs used were IGS R 5’-CTGGTGCCAAGGCATCCA-3’ (SEQ ID No. 4) and IGS L 5’-GCTGGATCACCTCCTTTCT-3’ (SEQ ID No. 3). The cycling conditions were 20 94°C for 4 min (1 cycle), 94°C for 45 sec, 53°C for 45 sec, 72°C for 45 sec (28 cycles). The PCR reaction contained 2 μΐ (lOOng) of DNA, PCR mix (Sigma, Red Taq), 0.025 nM IGS L and R primer (MWG Biotech, Germany). The PCR reactions were performed on a Biotherma thermocycler. The PCR products (10 μΐ) were ran alongside a molecular weight marker (100 bp Ladder, Roche) on a 2 % agarose EtBr stained gel in TAE, to determine the IGS profile. PCR 25 products of Bifidobacterium (single band) were purified using the Promega Wizard PCR purification kit. The purified PCR products were sequenced using the primer sequences (above) for the intergenic spacer region. Sequence data was then searched against the NCBI nucleotide database to determine the identity of the strain by nucleotide homology. The resultant DNA sequence data was subjected to the NCBI standard nucleotide-to-nucleotide homology BLAST PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 13 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 search engine (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The nearest match to the sequence was identified and then the sequences were aligned for comparison using DNASTAR MegAlign software. The sequences (SEQ ID NO. 1 [IGS forward sequence] and SEQ ID NO. 2 [IGS reverse sequence]) obtained can be viewed in the sequence listing. Searching the NCIMB 5 database revealed that AH1714 has a unique IGS (SEQ ID NO. 1 [forward sequence] and SEQ ID NO. 2 [reverse sequence]) sequence with its closest sequence homology to a Bifidobacterium longum. 
 In order to develop a barcode PCR profile for AH1714, PCR was performed using BOX primers 10 (8). The cycling conditions were 94°C for 7 min (1 cycle); 94°C for 1 minute, 53°C for 45secs, 65°C for 8 minutes, (30cycles) and 65°C for 16 minutes. The PCR reaction contained 50ng of DNA, PCR mix (Sigma, Red Taq) and 0.03 nM BOXA1R primer (5’-CTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGACG-3’) (SEQ ID NO. 5) (MWG Biotech, Germany). The PCR reactions were performed on a Biotherma thermocycler. The PCR products were run on a 15 3% agarose gel alongside a molecular weight marker (Roche, lOObp ladder) and imaged. 
 Antibiotic sensitivity profiles 
 The antibiotic sensitivity profiles for B. longum AH1714 was determined using the ‘disc susceptibility’ assay. The cultures were grown up in the appropriate broth medium for 48h and 20 spread-plated (ΙΟΟμΙ) onto agar media. Discs containing known concentrations of the antibiotics were placed onto the agar. Strains were examined for antibiotic sensitivity after 1-2 days incubation at 37°C under anaerobic conditions.

 To determine whether Bifidobacterium longum AH1714 could survive at low pH values equivalent to those found in the stomach, bacterial cells were harvested from fresh overnight cultures, washed twice in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and resuspended in TPY broth adjusted to pH 2.5 (with 1M HC1). Cells were incubated at 37°C and survival measured at intervals of 5, 30, 10 60 and 120 minutes using the plate count method. AH1714 survived well for 5 minutes at pH 2.5 while no viable cells were recovered after 30 minutes. 
 Upon exiting the stomach, putative probiotics are exposed to bile salts in the small intestine. In order to determine the ability of B. longum AH1714 to survive exposure to bile, cultures were 15 streaked on TPY agar plates supplemented with 0.3% (w/v), 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 7.5% or 10% porcine bile. B. longum AH1714 growth was observed on plates containing up to 0.5% bile. 
 Table 3 - Growth of AH 1714 in the presence of porcine bile (duplicate results) % (w/v) Porcine bile Strain 0.0 0.3 0.5 1.0 2.0 5.0 7.5 10.0 AH 1714 +++ ++ + - - - - - PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 15 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 +++ = very good growth -100% ++ = good growth -66% + = poor growth -33% - = no growth-0% 5 
 In a germ-free murine model, the ability of B. longum AH1714 to transit the gastrointestinal tract was assessed. Mice consumed lxlO9 AH1714 daily and faecal pellets were examined for the presence of the fed micro-organism. Detection of AH1714 was facilitated by isolating a spontaneous rifampicin resistant variant of the bifidobacteria - incorporation of rifampicin in the 10 RCA + cysteine plates used to assess transit ensured that only the fed rifampicin resistant bifiobacteria was cultured. Faecal samples were collected daily and B. longum AH1714 transit through the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed (See Fig. 1) 
 Anti-microbial activity 15 To assess the antimicrobial activities of B. longum AH1714 against indicator cultures and to determine if the antimicrobial activity was due to acid production, AH1714 was grown overnight in MRS (supplemented with 0.05% cysteine-HCl). 2 μΐ of AH1714 culture was spotted onto the agar and incubated for 24 h. The indicator organisms were grown in TSB (E.coli and Salmonella typhimurium), Brucella broth (Campylobacter jejuni) and Reinforced Clostridia 20 Media (RCM, Clostridium difficile). The indicator lawn was prepared by inoculating a molten overlay with 2% (v/v) of the overnight indicator culture, which was poured onto the surface of the spotted probiotic cultures following overnight growth on the agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37°C under suitable conditions for the indicator strain and the growth recorded after 24-48 hr. Zones of clearing greater than 1 mm diameter were considered sensitive to the 25 probiotic strain. This assay was also performed on media supplemented with 2% β-glycerophosphate as a buffering agent to limit antagonistic activity due to acid production.

 Generation of rifampicin ('Rif11! resistant strains of 1714 
 In order to track transit of AH1714 in faecal samples, a spontaneous rifampicin-resistant variant (rif+) was isolated as follows: a fresh broth culture of AH1714 was spread-plated (100pL) onto MRS + rifampicin + cysteine with the lowest concentration of rifampicin (range was 0.1%, 5 0.08%, 0.06%, 0.04%, 0.02% and 0.002%). Plate media without rifampicin was included as a positive control. Both sets of plates were incubated anaerobically at 37°C (48 hours). The removed plates were assessed for purity before picking one colony from the rifampicin supplemented agar plate and streaking onto the rifampicin supplemented plate of next highest concentration. In addition, a colony was streaked from the MRS agar plate onto a fresh MRS 10 agar plate and both sets of plates incubated anaerobically at 37°C (48 hours). This process was repeated for the full range of rifampicin supplemented plates. A single colony from a fully grown culture on a 50 pg/mL rifampicin supplemented MRS agar plate was used to inoculate into 20 ml MRS broth and the resultant culture used for subsequent stocking. The identity of the variant was confirmed by microscopic assessment, IGS sequence analysis and by specific PCR analysis. L5 
 Example 2 - Congo red agar screen A Congo red agar screen was used to phenotypically screen for EPS expressing bacterial strains. Briefly, 10ml Modified Rogosa broth media (+ 0.05% cysteine) was inoculated aseptically with a freshly grown colony of the bacterial strain and incubatd anaerobically at 37°C until turbid 20 (about 16 to about 24 hours). The broth cultures were aseptically streaked onto Congo Red Agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 48 hours. It is believed that EPS produced as a by-product of the growth and/or metabolism of certain strains prevents the uptake of the Congo red stain resulting in a cream/white colony morphology. Stains that produce less EPS take up the Congo red stain easily, resulting in a pink/red colony morphology. Strains that do not produce 25 an EPS stain red and look almost transparent in the red agar background. 
 Referring to Fig. 2 the colony morphology for B. longum AH1714 is convex, mucoid, bright white colonies 30 Example 3 - Bifidobacteria 1714 induces a significantly elevated IL-10:IL-12 ratio. 
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy human peripheral blood using BD Vacutainer CPT tubes (BD catalog 362761), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were washed and resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium-Glutamax ™ (Glutamax (Glutamine substitute) + pyruvate + 4.5 g/1 glucose (Gibco catalog WO 2011/058535 PCT/IE2010/000066 17 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 10569-010) 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma catalog F4135), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma catalog P0781). PBMCs were incubated (2 x 105 cells per well) in flat-bottomed 96-well plates and 20pL of a bacterial suspension (at a concentration of 1 x 107 CFU/mL) was added. PBMCs were co-incubated with bacteria for 48 hours at 37°C / 5% CO2 in an incubator. After 5 the 2 day incubation period, the plates were centrifuged at 300 x g, and the supernatants were removed and stored frozen at -80°C until analysis. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) levels in the culture supernatants were quantified using a 96-well assay kit from Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD; catalog K15008B-1) 
 Bacteria were prepared for co-culture experiments in two formats, (a) Freshly grown bacteria 10 were grown in Difco MRS media and harvested just after entering into stationary phase. All cells were grown under anaerobic conditions at 37°C. (b) Bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions at 37°C in Difco MRS media and harvested just after entering into stationary phase. Freeze dried powders were generated for each of these bacteria and stored at -80°C in pre-aliquoted lOOmg vials. Immediately prior to their use, one aliquot of each strain was removed 15 from the freezer and allowed to reach room temperature. Each strain was washed 3 times in 10ml ringers followed by centrifugation. A fresh vial was used on each occasion. Growth curves (OD vs number of live cells) were constructed for each growth condition, and washed cells were normalized by cell number before addition to the PBMCs. A no-bacteria control was also included in all experiments. All assays were done in triplicate. The results are presented in Fig. 20 3. 
 The control of inflammatory diseases is exerted at a number of levels. The controlling factors include hormones, prostaglandins, reactive oxygeii and nitrogen intermediates, leukotrienes and cytokines. Cytokines are low molecular weight biologically active proteins that are involved in the generation and control of immunological and inflammatory responses. A number of cell 25 types produce these cytokines, with neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes being the major sources during inflammatory reactions due to their large numbers at the injured site. 
 Multiple mechanisms exist by which cytokines generated at inflammatory sites influence the inflammatory response. Chemotaxis stimulates homing of inflammatory cells to the injured site, whilst certain cytokines promote infiltration of cells into tissue. Cytokines released within the 30 injured tissue result in activation of the inflammatory infiltrate. Most cytokines are pleiotropic and express multiple biologically overlapping activities. As uncontrolled inflammatory responses can result in diseases such as IBD, it is reasonable to expect that cytokine production has gone astray in individuals affected with these diseases. PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 18 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 
 Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which is produced by many cell types including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells and lymphocytes (in particular T regulatory cells). IL-10 down-regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory Thl cytokines, MHC class II antigens, and co-stimulatory molecules on antigen presenting cells. It also enhances B 5 cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production. This cytokine can block NF-κΒ activity, and is involved in the regulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Murine knock-out studies have demonstrated the essential role for IL-10 in immunoregulation as IL-10KO mice develop severe colitis. In addition, bacteria which are potent inducers of IL-10 have been shown to promote T regulatory cell differentiation in vivo thus contributing to immunological homeostasis 10 (7; 8). 
 Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with polarisation of Thl effector T cell responses and stimulates the production of other pro-inflammatory Thl cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), from T and natural killer (NK) cells. High levels of IL-12 expression is associated with autoimmunity. 15 Administration of IL-12 to people suffering from autoimmune diseases was shown to worsen disease symptoms. In contrast, IL-12 knock-out mice or treatment of mice with IL-12 neutralising antibodies ameliorated the disease. 
 Cytokine cascades and networks control the inflammatory response, rather than the action of a particular cytokine on a particular cell type. The relative levels of expression, or balance, of two 20 cytokines (such as IL-10 and IL-12) is more informative than the expression of a single cytokine. In these studies, we stimulated human PBMCs with a range of different bacterial strains. All strains induced IL-10 and all strains induced IL-12. However, examination of the ratio between IL-10 and IL-12 induction revealed that some bacterial strains induced a higher ratio (i.e. more IL-10 with less IL-12) compared to other strains. This is a meaningful observation as it is the 25 balance between each of these opposing signals that ultimately determines the immunological outcome. It is anticipated that a high IL-10:IL-12 ratio would promote an anti-inflammatory response associated with appropriate immunoregulatory activity while a low IL-10:IL-12 ratio would contribute to Thl polarisation of the immune response. Thus, the PBMC IL-10:IL-12 ratio is a important selection criterion for identification of bacterial strains with 30 immunoregulatory properties.

 Long term feeding of mice (115 days) with Bif. AH1714 is associated with an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 from stimulated ex vivo PBMCs, compared to placebo group PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 20 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 (fed PBS) for healthy mice (See Figure 4 (B)) or in a Sepsis/Inflammation model (mice challenged with LPS; See Figure 4 (C)).

 Bifidobacterium longum infantis strain UCC35624 (B624), two independent culture batches (1 &amp; 2) and Bifidobacterium longum strain 1714 are assayed for immuno-modulation using a PBMC cytokine induction assay with 1.0E+07 bacteria. Supernatants are assayed for a range of cytokines, including IL-Ιβ, -6, -8, -10 and -12, TNF- a and IFN-γ. 25 
 By comparison with 35624 (both cultures of which gave a similar pattern for all cytokines measured), strain 1714 exhibited a very similar pattern for many of the cytokines measured. Surprisingly however, 1714 gave quite a different pattern for IL-12, IFNy and IL-6. 30 IL-6: Incubation with 1714 induces a significantly lower level of IL-6 compared to 35624 at 1.0 x 107 bacteria per well (See Table 5)

The in vivo protection observed was strain specific. The cytokine profile 15 obtained for Bif. AH 1714 would suggest that this strain has the potential for improved efficacy in the in vivo ulcerative colitis model. IL-6 is a cytokine strongly implicated in the pathology of IBS. L-6 is relevant to many disease processes such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's Disease, systemic lupus 20 erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Hence there is an interest in developing anti-IL-6 agents as therapy against many of these diseases. 
 Example 6 - Bif. AH1714 reduces LPS-induced NFkB activity in an in-vivo murine Sepsis/Inflammation model 25 
 Materials &amp; Methods PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 23 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 NFkBlux transgenic mice on a C57BL/6J-CBA/J background are obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, USA) and bred in-house. Mice are housed under barrier maintained conditions. 5 Female animals are administered Bif. AH1714, as a freeze-dried powder reconstituted in water at approximately lxl09 colony forming units/day/animal, or a placebo control. Mice consume the commensal micro-organism in their drinking water ad libitum for 20 days prior to LPS challenge. 10 NFkB activity is measured following the administration of the substrate luciferin and imaged using the Xenogen IVIS 100. Baseline NFkB activity is measured prior to challenge with a single 0.5mg/kg dose of LPS. After 3 hours all animals are then reimaged. Whole body NFkB activity is assessed by subtracting baseline readings. 15 All animals are then culled and spleens, livers, small intestine and colon removed and placed in a culture dish for individual imaging. 
 Results 
 Bif. AH1714 reduces systemic LPS-induced NFkB activity in an in-vivo murine 20 Sepsis/Inflammation model as demonstrated by a decreased NFkB activity in spleens isolated 3 hours post challenge (See Fig. 9) and from whole animal imaging 1.5 hours post challenge (See Fig. 10) from 1714-fed animals compared to Placebo-fed animals. These results demonstrate that feeding with Bif. 1714 is associated with a decreased level of systemic inflammation associated with the transcription factor NFkB. 25 
 Example 7-1714 exhibits positive benefits in animal models of depression and anxiety 
 Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric disorders with a high prevalence rate in the community. Anxiety disorders are usually subdivided into panic disorder, generalised anxiety 30 disorder, post-traumatic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. 
 Modem antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) and selective noradrenergic and serotinergic reuptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine) are widely used to treat these disorders. However, the treatments are not always effective and are not acceptable to PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 24 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 patients. There is a need to develop alternative strategies. The possibility that probiotics might be effective in such conditions is suggested by previous data indicating that the probiotic Bifidobacterium Infantis reduces the stress hormone corticosterone in rodents (9). 5 We here examine the behavioural effects of Bifidobacterium AH1714 in models of stress in mice and compared with a widely used SSRI, namely, escitalopram, which is used to treat both anxiety and depression. Animals are treated with either escitalopram or AH1714 for three weeks. 10 Material &amp; Methods Tail suspension test A well characterized test for assessing depression-like and antidepressant like activity. Mice are individually suspended by the tail to a horizontal ring-stand bar (distance from floor = 30 cm) using adhesive tape (distance from tip of tail = 2 cm). Typically, mice demonstrate several 15 escape-oriented behaviours interspersed with temporally increasing bouts of immobility. A 6-minute test session is employed which is videotaped. Videotapes are subsequently scored by a highly trained observer who is unaware of the treatment. The parameter recorded is the number of seconds spent immobile. 20 Fear conditionins test 
 Widely used to assess the cognitive components of anxiety disorders. We use a three day protocol which allows for contextual and cue-associated fear learning to be observed. Following 3 minutes of exploring their environmental context mice receiving 6 pairings of 20 seconds of a specific cue (Tone of 10 KHz, 70dB combined with apparatus light on) coupled at the end with 2 25 seconds of a mild electrical footshock (0.4mA), this is followed by lmin exposure to the context only. The procedure is repeated for two subsequent days, however, no shock is given and freezing behaviour to the context or cue is observed throughout. The first day allows for assessment of the ability of the intervention to alter the strength of context and cue-induced fear conditioning, whereas the third day allows for extinction of fear learning to be observed. 30 Extinction is the formation of new memories and drugs that facilitate extinction may play a role in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 The marble-burvine test PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 25 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 
 Proposed as model of obsessive compulsive disorder. Animals who are more anxious must engage in active behaviours (defensive marble burying) to avoid anxiogenic stimuli in the light-dark box and elevated mazes. Mice are placed individually in small cages, in which 20 marbles had been equally distributed on top of a 5 cm - deep bed of sawdust, and a wire lid placed on 5 top of the cage. Mice are left undisturbed for 30 min, after which the number of buried marbles (i.e., those more than less than three-quarters covered by sawdust) are counted. 
 Results 
 In the tail suspension test AH1714 gives a positive result suggesting possible antidepressant 10 activity. Referring to Fig. 11, AH1714 induced lower immobility time than the vehicle (Veh) which suggests lower depression-like behavious in 1714-fed animals. This is similar to the impact of conventional antidepressants such as Lexapro®. 
 In terms of cognition, in the fear conditioning test, test animals treated with AH1714 showed a 15 positive learning effect. Referring to Fig. 12, in context (mainly hippocampus and amygdale-dependent memories) fear conditioning tests, 1714 induced higher freezing to the context (Cxt) than the vehicle (Veh) on day 1 and day 2, with the same freezing percentage as the vehicle on day 3, this suggests that 1714 promotes contextual fear learning and memory without impairing extinction, suggesting a positive role in contextual memory of fearful events. Referring to Fig. 20 13, in cue (amygdale-dependent) fear conditioning tests, 1714 induced higher freezing to the fearful cue (stimulus) than the vehicle (Veh) on day 1, with the same freezing percentage as the vehicle on days 2 and 3. This suggests that 1714 promoted amygdale-dependent (cue) fear learning and memory without impairing memory and extinction, suggesting a positive role in the memory of a fearful stimulus independently of the context. 25 
 Evidence of a possible effect in obsessive compulsive disorder emerges from studies with the marble burying test. Animals treated with AH1714 buried less marbles in the marble burying task which is indicative of lower anxiety in 1714-fed animals and suggests a possible effect in obsessive compulsive disorder (Fig. 14). As in the case of escitalopram, AH1714 induced a 30 lower body temperature increase induced by the stress of being handled (decreased stress induced hypothermia) this suggests lower anxiety in 1714-fed animals (Fig. 24). There were no differences between the results with either intervention. 
 Conclusion PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 26 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 AH1714 in animal models of depression and anxiety behaves in a similar way to a conventional antidepressant. The impact observed is similar to that reported in the literature for antidepressants such as SSRIs. 5 Overall, the data indicate that AH1714 may be of benefit in the treatment of the psychiatric syndromes of depression and anxiety. 
 Example 8: 1714 exhibits positive benefits on inflammatory markers in diet-induced obesity 10 In recent years, it has been well established that obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammation that contributes to the development of the pathologies associated with obesity which include type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Visceral fat produces a number of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (such as leptin, 15 tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-a), macrophage chemo-attractant protein-1 and interleukin-6, among others), whose production can be pathologically dysregulated in the obese state (reviewed by Shoelson et al., 2007). Indeed, while macrophages are thought to contribute in an important manner to insulin resistance, other studies have suggested that harnessing the anti-inflammatory properties of cells with a potentially regulatory phenotype may have therapeutic potential. A 20 recent study suggests that Treg cells reduce the inflammatory state of adipose tissue and, thus, insulin resistance in mice (Feurer et al., 2009). In addition, a seminal body of work has implicated abnormalities of the gut microbiota as a driving force of obesity-related metabolic dysregulation, suggesting that interventions which target gut health will have beneficial health effects in obesity related metabolic derangements. It has been suggested that the gut microbiota 25 may be involved in the development of obesity in the regulation of energy homeostasis, in insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and in energy, lipid and amino acid metabolism (reviewed by Ley et al., 2009) 
 The Diet-Induced Obesity (DIO) mouse model was chosen as the most appropriate mouse 30 model for assessing the impact of selected probiotic candidates on obesity and metabolic health and to look at the relationship between obesity and inflammatory markers. The DIO mouse model refers to healthy mice fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity over time. 
 Experimental Design WO 2011/058535 PCT/IE2010/000066 27 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 
 Seven-week old male C57BL/J6 mice were fed a low-fat diet (10% calories from fat; Research Diets, New Jersey; #D12450B), a high-fat diet (DIO; 45% calories from fat; Research Diets, New Jersey; #D 12451) or a high-fat diet with AH1714 (1 x 109 cfu/day) in drinking water for 14 weeks. All mice were housed in groups of 5 and fresh probiotic aliquots were administered daily. 5 Body weight and food intake were assessed weekly. At the end of 14 weeks the mice were sacrificed and internal organs were removed, weighed and stored at -80°C. The spleens removed and splenocyte cytokine assays were carried out as in example 4. 
 Results 10 As expected, DIO mice gained significantly more fat mass (p<0.001) compared to lean controls over the 14-week feeding period. In agreement with previous studies, DIO mice consumed significantly more calories than lean controls, as measured by the cumulative caloric intake over the 14 week period of the study (p<0.001). In LPS stimulated splenocytes (innate immunity stimulus) from DIO mice, AH1714 had the effect of lowering the TNFa and IL-12 15 cytokine response to LPS (FIG 16). In CD3/CD28 stimulated spenocytes (adaptive immunity stimulus), treatment with AH1714 had the effect of lowering the IL6 cytokine response. These results indicate a systemic anti-inflammatory effect in the DIO mouse model consistent with the PBMC data and in vivo mouse model data illustrated in other examples. 20 Immunomodulation 
 The human immune system plays a significant role in the aetiology and pathology of a vast range of human diseases. Hyper and hypo-immune responsiveness results in, or is a component of, the majority of disease states. One family of biological entities, termed cytokines, are particularly important to the control of immune processes. Pertubances of these 25 delicate cytokine networks are being increasingly associated with many diseases. These diseases include but are not limited to inflammatory disorders, immunodeficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, cancer (particularly those of the gastrointestinal and immune systems), diarrhoeal disease, antibiotic associated diarrhoea, paediatric diarrhoea, appendicitis, autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s 30 disease, rheumatoid arthritis, coeliac disease, diabetes mellitus, organ transplantation, bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, periodontal disease, urogenital disease, sexually transmitted disease, HIV infection, HIV replication, HIV associated diarrhoea, surgical associated trauma, surgical-induced metastatic disease, sepsis, weight loss, anorexia, fever control, cachexia, wound healing, ulcers, gut barrier function, allergy, asthma, respiratory WO 2011/058535 PCT/IE2010/000066 28 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 disorders, circulatory disorders, coronary heart disease, anaemia, disorders of the blood coagulation system, renal disease, disorders of the central nervous system, hepatic disease, ischaemia, nutritional disorders, osteoporosis, endocrine disorders, epidermal disorders, psoriasis and acne vulgaris. 5 
 The effects on cytokine production are specific for each of the probiotic strains examined. Thus specific probiotic strains may be selected for normalising an exclusive cytokine imbalance particular for a specific disease type. Customisation of disease specific therapies can be accomplished using either a single strain of AH1714 or mutants or variants thereof or a 10 selection of these strains. 
 Immune Education 
 The enteric flora is important to the development and proper function of the intestinal immune system. In the absence of an enteric flora, the intestinal immune system is underdeveloped, as 15 demonstrated in germ free animal models, and certain functional parameters are diminished, such as macrophage phagocytic ability and immunoglobulin production (10). The importance of the gut flora in stimulating non-damaging immune responses is becoming more evident. The increase in incidence and severity of allergies in the western world has been linked with an increase in hygiene and sanitation, concomitant with a decrease in the number and range of 20 infectious challenges encountered by the host. This lack of immune stimulation may allow the host to react to non-pathogenic, but antigenic, agents resulting in allergy or autoimmunity. Deliberate consumption of a series of non-pathogenic immunomodulatory bacteria would provide the host with the necessary and appropriate educational stimuli for proper development and control of immune function. 25 
 Inflammation 
 Inflammation is the term used to describe the local accumulation of fluid, plasma proteins and white blood cells at a site that has sustained physical damage, infection or where there is an ongoing immune response. Control of the inflammatory response is exerted on a number of 30 levels (11). The controlling factors include cytokines, hormones (e.g. hydrocortisone), prostaglandins, reactive intermediates and leukotrienes. Cytokines are low molecular weight biologically active proteins that are involved in the generation and control of immunological and inflammatory responses, while also regulating development, tissue repair and haematopoiesis. They provide a means of communication between leukocytes themselves and also with other cell PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 29 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 types. Most cytokines are pleiotrophic and express multiple biologically overlapping activities. Cytokine cascades and networks control the inflammatory response rather than the action of a particular cytokine on a particular cell type (12). Waning of the inflammatory response results in lower concentrations of the appropriate activating signals and other inflammatory mediators 5 leading to the cessation of the inflammatory response. TNFa is a pivotal proinflammatory cytokine as it initiates a cascade of cytokines and biological effects resulting in the inflammatory state. Therefore, agents which inhibit TNFa are currently being used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, e.g. infliximab. 10 Pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current therapies for treating IBD are aimed at reducing the levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8 and TNFa. Such therapies may also play a significant role in the treatment of systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. 15 
 The strains of the present invention may have potential application in the treatment of a range of inflammatory diseases, particularly if used in combination with other anti-inflammatory therapies, such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or Infliximab. 20 Cytokines and Cancer 
 The production of multifunctional cytokines across a wide spectrum of tumour types suggests that significant inflammatory responses are ongoing in patients with cancer. It is currently unclear what protective effect this response has against the growth and development of tumour cells in vivo. However, these inflammatory responses could adversely affect the tumour-bearing 25 host. Complex cytokine interactions are involved in the regulation of cytokine production and cell proliferation within tumour and normal tissues (13, 14). It has long been recognized that weight loss (cachexia) is the single most common cause of death in patients with cancer and initial malnutrition indicates a poor prognosis. For a tumour to grow and spread it must induce the formation of new blood vessels and degrade the extracellular matrix. The inflammatory 30 response may have significant roles to play in the above mechanisms, thus contributing to the decline of the host and progression of the tumour. Due to the anti-inflammatory properties of Bifidobacterium longum infantis these bacterial strains they may reduce the rate of malignant cell transformation. Furthermore, intestinal bacteria can produce, from dietary compounds, substances with genotoxic, carcinogenic and tumour-promoting activity and gut bacteria can PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 30 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 activate pro-carcinogens to DNA reactive agents (15). In general, species of Bifidobacterium have low activities of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes compared to other populations within the gut such as bacteroides, eubacteria and clostridia. Therefore, increasing the number of Bifidobacterium bacteria in the gut could beneficially modify the levels of these enzymes. 5 
 Vaccine/Drug Delivery 
 The majority of pathogenic organisms gain entry via mucosal surfaces. Efficient vaccination of these sites protects against invasion by a particular infectious agent. Oral vaccination strategies have concentrated, to date, on the use of attenuated live pathogenic organisms or purified 10 encapsulated antigens (16). Probiotic bacteria, engineered to produce antigens from an infectious agent, in vivo, may provide an attractive alternative as these bacteria are considered to be safe for human consumption (GRAS status). 
 Murine studies have demonstrated that consumption of probiotic bacteria expressing foreign 15 antigens can elicit protective immune responses. The gene encoding tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) was expressed in Lactococcus lactis and mice were immunized via the oral route. This system was able to induce antibody titers significantly high enough to protect the mice from lethal toxin challenge. In addition to antigen presentation, live bacterial vectors can produce bioactive compounds, such as immunostimulatory cytokines, in vivo. L. lactis secreting 20 bioactive human IL-2 or IL-6 and TTFC induced 10-15 fold higher serum IgG titres in mice immunized intranasally (17). However, with this particular bacterial strain, the total IgA level was not increased by coexpression with these cytokines. Other bacterial strains, such as Streptococcus gordonii, are also being examined for their usefulness as mucosal vaccines. Recombinant S. gordonii colonizing the murine oral and vaginal cavities induced both mucosal 25 and systemic antibody responses to antigens expressed by this bacterial (18). Thus oral immunization using probiotic bacteria as vectors would not only protect the host from infection, but may replace the immunological stimuli that the pathogen would normally elicit thus contributing to the immunological education of the host. 30 Prebiotics 
 The introduction of probiotic organisms is accomplished by the ingestion of the micro-organism in a suitable carrier. It would be advantageous to provide a medium that would promote the growth of these probiotic strains in the large bowel. The addition of one or more oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, or other prebiotics enhances the growth of lactic acid bacteria PCT/IE2010/000066 WO 2011/058535 31 2015200833 19 Feb 2015 in the gastrointestinal tract. Prebiotics refers to any non-viable food component that is specifically fermented in the colon by indigenous bacteria thought to be of positive value, e.g. bifidobacteria, lactobacilli. Types of prebiotics may include those that contain fructose, xylose, soya, galactose, glucose and mannose. The combined administration of a probiotic strain with 5 one or more prebiotic compounds may enhance the growth of the administered probiotic in vivo resulting in a more pronounced health benefit, and is termed synbiotic. 
 Other active ingredients 
 It will be appreciated that the probiotic strains may be administered prophylactically or as a 10 method of treatment either on its own or with other probiotic and/or prebiotic materials as described above. In addition, the bacteria may be used as part of a prophylactic or treatment regime using other active materials such as those used for treating inflammation or other disorders especially those with an immunological involvement. Such combinations may be administered in a single formulation or as separate formulations administered at the same or 15 different times and using the same or different routes of administration.
