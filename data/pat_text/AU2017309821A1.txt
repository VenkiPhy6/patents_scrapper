 The present invention relates to fungi, plants infected with fungi, products produced by fungi, and related methods. 
 Background of the invention 
 Microbes represent an invaluable source of novel genes and compounds that have the potential to be utilised in a range of industrial sectors. Scientific literature gives numerous accounts of microbes being the primary source of antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anticancer agents and cholesterol-lowering drugs, in addition to their use in environmental decontamination and in the production of food and cosmetics. A relatively unexplored group of microbes known as endophytes, which reside in the tissues of living plants, offer a particularly diverse source of novel compounds and genes that may provide important benefits to society, and in particular, agriculture. 
 Endophytes often form mutualistic relationships with their hosts, with the endophyte conferring increased fitness to the host, often through the production of defence compounds. At the same time, the host plant offers the benefits of a protected environment and nutriment to the endophyte. 
 Members of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex belong to the Poaceae family of grasses. Some species of Brachiaria-Urochloa are economically significant tropical forage grasses that have been released as commercial cultivars and include B. brizantha, B. decumbens, B. dictyoneura, B. humidicola, and B. ruziziensis, as well as corresponding interspecific and intraspecific hybrids. 
 Genetic diversity analysis based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence data indicates a strong affinity between Urochloa and Brachiaria, supporting morphological and anatomical studies that show a continuous gradation between these grass genera.

 -2Seed-transmitted endophytic fungi have been observed in B. brizantha. These endophytes may play a role in protecting Brachiaria-Urochloa from fungal pathogens, such as Drechslera spp., which cause leaf spots. 
 There is a general lack of information and knowledge of the fungal endophytes of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex as well as of methods for the identification and characterization of endophytes and their deployment in Brachiaria-Urochloa plant improvement programs. 
 Identification and characterization of endophytes is generally based on morphological characterisation and molecular taxonomy analyses. Morphological characterisation includes analyses of macroscopic and microscopic structures of an endophyte grown on culture media. Molecular taxonomy analysis is mainly based on gene sequence analysis of spacer regions in nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA), particularly in phylogenomics. However, traditional methods of phylogenomics based on nrDNA sequences may not reflect the divergence of closely related species. 
 It is an objection of the present application to overcome, or at least alleviate, one or more of the difficulties or deficiencies associates with the prior art. 
 Summary of the Invention 
 This invention describes methods for the identification, isolation, characterisation and inoculation of novel endophytes from and in Brachiaria-Urochloa, respectively, that may be used to establish novel endophyte-Brachiaria/Urochloa associations for improved pasture production for livestock industries. 
 The discovery, characterization, and inoculation of novel fungal endophytes in associations with Brachiaria-Urochloa pasture grasses may assist in the varietal development process of these pasture grasses for livestock production in warmer climates around the world.

 -3Many of the commercially developed Brachiaria-Urochloa pasture grasses are aposporous apomicts. These grasses reproduce asexually through seed without a requirement for gamete union, hence propagating the maternal genotype. 
 Apomictic reproduction has a number of key advantages for research on, and use of, fungal endophyte-grass host associations. The practical implication of seed transmission of endophytes in Brachiaria-Urochloa is significant; once associated with the plant, the fungus can perpetuate itself through seed, provided that seed storage conditions do not reduce the survival of the fungus. 
 In a first aspect, the present invention provides a substantially purified or isolated fungus purified or isolated from a plant of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species complex and wherein, when said fungus is inoculated into a plant, said plant has improved resistance to diseases and/or pests relative to an uninoculated control plant. 
 Preferably, the fungus is selected from the group consisting of strain (i.e. isolate) 1.1.A, strain 3.3.A, strain 3.3.B, strain 3.3.C, strain 4.9.A, strain 4.9.B, strain 5.1.A, strain 5.1.B, strain 5.1.D, strain 5.1.E, strain 7.1.A, strain 8.1.A, strain 8.1.B, strain 8.1.C, strain 9.2.A, strain 9.2.B, strain 9.2.C, strain 10.1.A, strain 11.1.A, strain 12.1.A, strain 12.1 .B, strain 
 12.1. C, strain 12.1.D strain 12.1.E, strain 14.1.B, strain 14.1.C, strain 15.2.C, strain 
 15.2. D, strain 15.2.E, as described herein. 
 The fungus may be an Acremonium species strain, a Phialemonium species strain, a Simplicillium species strain, an Emericellopsis species strain, or a strain of a related or closely related species. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that strain 1.1 A is an Acremonium sclerotigenum species strain, strain 3.3A is a Phialemonium atrogriseum species strain, strain 5.1B is a Phialemonium atrogriseum species strain, strain 9.2A is a Simplicillium species strain, strain 12.1 A is an Emericellopsis species strain, and strain 12.1 B is an Acremonium sclerotigenum species strain. Thus, in preferred embodiments, the fungus may be an Acremonium sclerotigenum species strain, a Phialemonium atrogriseum species strain (previously Acremonium atrogriseum), a Simplicillium species strain, an Emericellopsis species strain, or a strain of a closely related species.

 -8absence of polymorphic markers such as simple sequence repeats. 
 Applicant has found that specific detection of fungi in planta with markers such as SSR markers has provided the tools for efficient assessment of fungus genetic diversity in diverse grass populations and the potential discovery of novel fungal strains. 
 By a ‘plurality’ of samples of endophytes or plant samples is meant a number sufficient to enable a comparison of genetic and metabolic profiles of individual fungal endophytes. Preferably, between approximately 10 and 1,000,000 samples of endophytes or plant samples are provided, more preferably between approximately 100 and 1,000 samples of endophytes or plant samples. 
 By ‘genetic analysis’ is meant analysing the nuclear and/or mitochondrial DNA of the endophyte. 
 This analysis may involve detecting the presence or absence of polymorphic markers, such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or mating-type markers. SSRs, also called microsatellites, are based on a 1-7 nucleotide core element, more typically a 1-4 nucleotide core element, that is tandemly repeated. The SSR array is embedded in complex flanking DNA sequences. Microsatellites are thought to arise due to the property of replication slippage, in which the DNA polymerase enzyme pauses and briefly slips in terms of its template, so that short adjacent sequences are repeated. Some sequence motifs are more slip-prone than others, giving rise to variations in the relative numbers of SSR loci based on different motif types. Once duplicated, the SSR array may further expand (or contract) due to further slippage and/or unequal sister chromatid exchange. The total number of SSR sites is high, such that in principle such loci are capable of providing tags for any linked gene. 
 SSRs are highly polymorphic due to variation in repeat number and are co-dominantly inherited. Their detection is based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), requiring only small amounts of DNA and suitable for automation. They are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes and have been found to occur in fungal genomes and in plant genomes. Consequently, SSRs are ideal markers for a broad range of applications such as genetic diversity analysis, genome mapping, trait mapping and marker-assisted

 Alternatively, or in addition, the genetic analysis may involve sequencing genomic and/or mitochondrial DNA and performing sequence comparisons to assess genetic variation between fungi. In a preferred embodiment, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence may be used for genetic analysis. 
 By ‘metabolic analysis’ is meant analysing metabolites, in particular toxins, produced by the fungi. Preferably, this is done by preparation of inoculated plants for each of the fungi and measurement of toxin levels in planta. More preferably, this is done by preparation of isogenically inoculated plants for each of the fungi and measurement of toxin levels in planta. 
 By a ‘desired genetic and metabolic profile’ is meant that the fungus includes genetic and metabolic characteristics that result in a beneficial phenotype in a plant harbouring, or otherwise associated with, the fungus. 
 Such beneficial properties include improved tolerance to water and/or nutrient stress and improved resistance to pests and/or diseases in the plant with which the fungus is associated. In a preferred embodiment, the beneficial properties include insecticidal or insect repellent activity. In a further preferred embodiment, the improved resistance to pests and/or diseases includes antifungal activity. 
 For example, resistance to pests and/or diseases in the plant may be increased by at least approximately 5%, more preferably at least approximately 10%, more preferably at least approximately 25%, more preferably at least approximately 50%, more preferably at least approximately 100%, relative to an uninoculated plant that does not contain the fungal endophyte. Preferably, resistance to pests and/or diseases in the plant may be increased by between approximately 5% and approximately 50%, more preferably between approximately 10% and approximately 25%, relative to an uninoculated plant that does not contain the fungal endophyte. 
 Alternatively, or in addition, a fungus may be selected and/or characterised based primarily on genetic analysis.

 -10Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for selecting and/or characterising a fungus, said method including subjecting a fungus to genetic analysis, wherein genetic analysis includes: 
 sequencing one or more non-coding nrDNA regions; sequencing one or more regions of a protein-coding gene; assessing the genetic variation of the sequenced regions; and optionally selecting a fungus having a desired genetic variation. 
 By nrDNA is meant non-ribosomal DNA. Eukaryotic nrDNA includes genes encoding small subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), and 5.8S nrDNAs. The SSU and LSU nrDNAs are separated by two external transcribed spacer (ETS), and a non-transcribed spacer (NTS), non-coding regions. The 5.8S rDNA is embedded in two internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) non-coding regions. 
 Thus, the non-coding nrDNA may be an ETS, NTS or ITS spacer. In preferred embodiments, the non-coding nrDNA is an ITS spacer. 
 The protein-coding gene is not particularly limited, but is preferably one which is not highly conserved. This may aid the differentiation of closely related species which may be characterisable by substantial or total identity in conserved protein-coding gene regions. One or more, for example two or three or more, protein-coding genes may be sequenced for this method. 
 Suitable protein-coding gene candidates include the tub2 gene (for β-tubulin biosynthesis), the tefA gene (translation elongation factor 1) and the act1 gene (for actin biosynthesis). In preferred embodiments, the protein-coding gene is the tub2 gene. 
 Sequencing may be performed by known techniques, i.e. amplification by PCR and Sanger sequencing technology. The person skilled in the art can readily determine an appropriate method and conditions. Sequencing a non-coding nrDNA region and sequencing a region of a protein-coding gene may include sequencing additional DNA, including up to the entire genome. The nrDNA and/or protein-coding gene regions may then be extracted therefrom.

 PCT/AU2017/050848 
 -11 The region of the non-coding nrDNA and/or the protein-coding gene may be the entire non-coding nrDNA or protein-coding gene, or may be a fragment thereof. For example, for an ITS spacer, the region may be the entire spacer, or may be a fragment thereof. Similarly, for the tub2 gene, the region may be the entire gene, or may be a fragment thereof. A suitable fragment size is not particularly limited, and may depend on the noncoding nrDNA or the protein-coding gene, along with a number of factors, i.e. selection of primers for PCR etc. Preferably, a fragment has a size of at least 20 nucleotides, more preferably at least 50 nucleotides, more preferably at least 100 nucleotides, and more preferably at least 200 nucleotides. In preferred embodiments, the region of the noncoding nrDNA and the protein-coding gene is substantially the entire non-coding nrDNA and protein-coding gene, respectively. 
 Assessing the genetic variation of the sequenced regions will usually involve a comparison of the sequenced regions against sequences of the same regions or part thereof of another fungus. The other fungus may be the same or a different fungus, for example a closely-related fungus, or a fungus of the same or similar origin. The sequences of the same regions or part thereof of another fungus may be obtained the same way, i.e. by sequencing the regions. Alternatively, or in addition, the sequences of the same regions or part thereof of another fungus may be obtained from existing resources, for example a database of sequence data. The comparison may be by way of, for example, sequence alignments. 
 The extent of variation may be complete or none, or any amount there between. For example, when compared with sequences of the same regions or part thereof of another fungus, the variation may be little or none, such that the compared regions are substantially identical or identical, respectively. Conversely, the variation may be complete, such that there is no identity between the compared regions. The extent of variation of the non-coding nrDNA and the region of a protein-coding gene may be independently different. 
 The extent of variation may be used to characterise a fungus, for example assign a fungus to a clade or to designate it to a taxonomic group. The characterisation may also include assigning a new species.

 -12 A fungus having a desired genetic variation may also be selected, for example for further analysis or application. A desired genetic variation may be, for example, complete variation, little or no variation. For example, little or no variation may be desired to indicate a close relationship to another fungus, for example to a fungus that includes genetic and metabolic characteristics that result in a beneficial phenotype in a plant harbouring, or otherwise associated with, the fungus. 
 Thus, the fungus may be an endophyte of a plant, for example a grass. Preferably the plant is a forage, turf or bioenergy grass, more preferably a plant of the BrachiariaUrochloa complex as hereinbefore described.

By ‘metabolic analysis’ is meant analysing metabolites, in particular toxins, produced by the fungi. Preferably, this is done by preparation of inoculated plants for each of the fungi and measurement of toxin levels in planta. More preferably, this is done by preparation of inoculated plants for each of the fungi and measurement of toxin levels in planta. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the method of the present invention may include the further step of assessing geographic origin of the fungus. In a preferred embodiment, this may include the further step of assessing geographic origin of the fungi and selecting fungi having a desired genetic and metabolic profile and a desired geographic origin.

 -17 The present invention encompasses functionally active fragments and variants of the nucleic acids of the present invention. By ‘functionally active’ in relation to the nucleic acid is meant that the fragment or variant (such as an analogue, derivative or mutant) is capable of manipulating synthesis of an organic compound of the present invention, for example by being translated into an enzyme that is able to participate in the pathway that results in synthesis of the organic compound. Such variants include naturally occurring allelic variants and non-naturally occurring variants. Additions, deletions, substitutions and derivatizations of one or more of the nucleotides are contemplated so long as the modifications do not result in loss of functional activity of the fragment or variant. Preferably the functionally active fragment or variant has at least approximately 80% identity to the relevant part of the above mentioned sequence to which the fragment or variant corresponds, more preferably at least approximately 90% identity, even more preferably at least approximately 95% identity, most preferably at least approximately 98% identity. Such functionally active variants and fragments include, for example, those having conservative nucleic acid changes. 
 Preferably the fragment has a size of at least 20 nucleotides, more preferably at least 50 nucleotides, more preferably at least 100 nucleotides, more preferably at least 200 nucleotides, more preferably at least 500 nucleotides. 
 By ‘conservative nucleic acid changes’ is meant nucleic acid substitutions that result in conservation of the amino acid in the encoded protein, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Such functionally active variants and fragments also include, for example, those having nucleic acid changes which result in conservative amino acid substitutions of one or more residues in the corresponding amino acid sequence. 
 By ‘conservative amino acid substitutions’ is meant the substitution of an amino acid by another one of the same class, the classes being as follows: 
 Nonpolar: Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met Phe, Trp Uncharged polar: Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Tyr, Asn, Gln Acidic: Asp, Glu 
 Basic: Lys, Arg, His

 -18Other conservative amino acid substitutions may also be made as follows: 
 Aromatic: Phe, Tyr, His 
 Proton Donor: Asn, Gln, Lys, Arg, His, Trp 
 Proton Acceptor: Glu, Asp, Thr, Ser, Tyr, Asn, Gln 
 In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a genetic construct including a nucleic acid according to the present invention. 
 By ‘genetic construct’ is meant a recombinant nucleic acid molecule. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the genetic construct according to the present invention may be a vector. 
 By a ‘vector’ is meant a genetic construct used to transfer genetic material to a target cell. 
 The vector may be of any suitable type and may be viral or non-viral. The vector may be an expression vector. Such vectors include chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic nucleic acid sequences, eg. derivatives of plant viruses; bacterial plasmids; derivatives of the Ti plasmid from Agrobacterium tumefaciens; derivatives of the Ri plasmid from Agrobacterium rhizogenes; phage DNA; yeast artificial chromosomes; bacterial artificial chromosomes; binary bacterial artificial chromosomes; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA. However, any other vector may be used as long as it is replicable or integrative or viable in the target cell. 
 In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the genetic construct may further include a promoter and a terminator; said promoter, gene and terminator being operatively linked. 
 By a ‘promoter’ is meant a nucleic acid sequence sufficient to direct transcription of an operatively linked nucleic acid sequence. 
 By Operatively linked’ is meant that the nucleic acid(s) and a regulatory sequence, such as a promoter, are linked in such a way as to permit expression of said nucleic acid 
 Substitute Sheets 
 RO/AU (Rule 26) 
 WO 2018/027276 
 PCT/AU2017/050848 
 -19under appropriate conditions, for example when appropriate molecules such as transcriptional activator proteins are bound to the regulatory sequence. Preferably an operatively linked promoter is upstream of the associated nucleic acid. 
 By ‘upstream’ is meant in the 3’->5’ direction along the nucleic acid. 
 The promoter and terminator may be of any suitable type and may be endogenous to the target cell or may be exogenous, provided that they are functional in the target cell. 
 A variety of terminators which may be employed in the genetic constructs of the present invention are also well known to those skilled in the art. The terminator may be from the same gene as the promoter sequence or a different gene. Particularly suitable terminators are polyadenylation signals. 
 The genetic construct, in addition to the promoter, the gene and the terminator, may include further elements necessary for expression of the nucleic acid, in different combinations, for example vector backbone, origin of replication (ori), multiple cloning sites, spacer sequences, enhancers, introns, antibiotic resistance genes and other selectable marker genes [such as the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptll) gene, the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene], and reporter genes (such as betaglucuronidase (GUS) gene (gusA)]. The genetic construct may also contain a ribosome binding site for translation initiation. The genetic construct may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. 
 Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various components of the genetic construct are operably linked, so as to result in expression of said nucleic acid. Techniques for operably linking the components of the genetic construct of the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques include the use of linkers, such as synthetic linkers, for example including one or more restriction enzyme sites. 
 Preferably, the genetic construct is substantially purified or isolated. By ‘substantially purified’ is meant that the genetic construct is free of the genes, which, in the naturallyoccurring genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid or promoter of the 
 Substitute Sheets 
 RO/AU (Rule 26) 
 WO 2018/027276 
 PCT/AU2017/050848 
 -20invention is derived, flank the nucleic acid or promoter. The term therefore includes, for example, a genetic construct which is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote; or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g. a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion) independent of other sequences. It also includes a genetic construct which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence. Preferably, the substantially purified genetic construct is at least approximately 90% pure, more preferably at least approximately 95% pure, even more preferably at least approximately 98% pure, even more preferably at least approximately 99% pure. 
 The term “isolated” means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally occurring nucleic acid present in a living plant is not isolated, but the same nucleic acid separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such nucleic acids could be part of a vector and/or such nucleic acids could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that such a vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. 
 As an alternative to use of a selectable marker gene to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells, the presence of the genetic construct in transformed cells may be determined by other techniques well known in the art, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), Southern blot hybridisation analysis, histochemical assays (e.g. GUS assays), northern and western blot hybridisation analyses. 
 The genetic constructs of the present invention may be introduced into plants or fungi by any suitable technique. Techniques for incorporating the genetic constructs of the present invention into plant cells or fungal cells (for example by transduction, transfection, transformation or gene targeting) are well known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques include Agrobacterium-mediated introduction, Rhizobium-mediated introduction, electroporation to tissues, cells and protoplasts, protoplast fusion, injection into reproductive organs, injection into immature embryos and high velocity projectile introduction to cells, tissues, calli, immature and mature embryos, biolistic transformation, Whiskers transformation, and combinations thereof. The choice of 
 Substitute Sheets 
 RO/AU (Rule 26) 
 WO 2018/027276 
 PCT/AU2017/050848 
 -21 technique will depend largely on the type of plant or fungus to be transformed, and may be readily determined by an appropriately skilled person. For transformation of plant protoplasts, PEG-mediated transformation is particularly preferred. For transformation of fungal protoplasts, electroporation and PEG-mediated transformation are particularly preferred. For transformation of fungal hyphae, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is particularly preferred. 
 Cells incorporating the genetic constructs of the present invention may be selected, as described below, and then cultured in an appropriate medium to regenerate transformed plants or fungi, using techniques well known in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, will be apparent to the person skilled in the art. The resulting plants may be reproduced, either sexually or asexually, using methods well known in the art, to produce successive generations of transformed plants or fungi. 
 The present invention also provides a substantially purified or isolated polypeptide involved in the production of an organic compound of the present invention. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide may be involved in the production of peramine or an analogue, derivative or salt thereof. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide may be encoded by a nucleic acid according to the present invention. 
 The present invention encompasses functionally active fragments and variants of the polypeptides of the present invention. By ‘functionally active’ in this context is meant that the fragment or variant has one or more of the biological properties of the corresponding protein from which the fragment or variant is derived. Additions, deletions, substitutions and derivatizations of one or more of the amino acids are contemplated so long as the modifications do not result in loss of functional activity of the fragment or variant. Preferably the fragment or variant has at least approximately 80% identity to the relevant part of the above mentioned sequence to which the fragment or variant corresponds, more preferably at least approximately 90% identity, more preferably at least approximately 95% identity, most preferably at least approximately 98% identity. Such functionally active variants and fragments include, for example, those having

 -22 conservative amino acid substitutions of one or more residues in the corresponding amino acid sequence. 
 Preferably the fragment has a size of at least 10 amino acids, more preferably at least 20 amino acids, more preferably at least 50 amino acids, more preferably at least 100 amino acids, more preferably at least 200 amino acids. As used herein, except where the context requires otherwise, the term comprise and variations of the term, such as comprising, comprises and comprised, are not intended to exclude further additives, components, integers or steps.

 To characterise the diversity of the grass species and confirm their assignment to the Brachiaria-Urochloa complex, genetic diversity analysis was conducted using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from Brachiaria-Urochloa. The primer pairs BbUNICAMPOOl, BbUNICAMP002, BbUNICAMP003, BbUNICAMP004, BbUNICAMP005, BbUNICAMP006 and BbUNICAMP007 were selected (Jungmann et

 -28al. 1999) and used to amplify across species of Brachiaria-Urochloa. As the ploidy levels between different Brachiaria-Urochloa species varies, alleles for each SSR locus were scored dominantly (presence/absence) and principal components analysis (PCA) was performed (Figure 1). 
 Each of the Brachiaria-Urochloa species was effectively discriminated using these markers. No variation within populations was observed, as expected for apomictic species. B. brizantha and B. decumbens are more similar to each other than they are to B. humidicola and U. mosambicensis. There are two B. humidicola populations, with 
 Humidicolal being distinct from Humidicola2 and U. mosambicensis. The genetically distinct nature of the Humidicolal and Humidicola2 plants suggests that there are two different (sub)-species present in the B. humidicola seed batches analysed. 
 Example 2 - Isolation of Fungal Endophytes from Brachiaria-Urochloa Grasses 
 Fungal endophytes from Brachiaria-Urochloa grasses were isolated from surfacesterilised young tiller explants (Figure 2). A total of 31 fungal endophytes were isolated and subcultured. Twenty nine fungal endophyte isolates were identified by morphological examination in in vitro culture. Two fungal endophyte isolates (14.1.A and 
 14.1.D) were excluded from further analysis. Table 2 shows a summary of the fungal endophytes isolated from Brachiaria-Urochloa grasses.

 -30spacers ITS1 and ITS2 and the 5.8S subunit was PCR-amplified using primers ITS5 and 
 ITS4 (White et al. 1990). Purified PCR amplification products were sequenced using 
 Sanger sequencing technology. Isolated subcultured endophytes were then grouped based on ITS sequence identity. Sequence data was used in BLASTn analysis to identify matches in the NCBI database (Table 3). 
 Phylogenetic analysis of 29 fungal endophytes isolated from Brachiaria-Urochloa grasses identified 4 distinct clades based on nuclear rDNA ITS sequence (Figure 3). Morphological differences in the endophytes exist both between and within these ITS groups (Figure 4). Endophyte isolates within each clade matched (<99% identity) to a wide range of different Ascomycetes (Table 3). None of the endophyte isolates isolated from the Brachiaria-Urochloa grasses displayed 100% identity to the nuclear rDNA ITS sequence from other fungi within the public database, indicating unique fungal endophytes have been isolated. 
 Molecular analysis of the 29 endophyte isolates with nuclear rDNA ITS data identified presence of multiple endophyte strains within the same plant for plants 9.2 and 12.1 (Table 4). The presence of multiple endophyte strains within the one host plant is not usually observed in other grass species such as perennial ryegrass and tall fescue, suggesting a novel discovery in Brachiaria.

 Example 4 - Metabolic Profiling of Brachiaria-Urochloa Grass-Endophyte Associations 
 Mature plants of Brachiaria-Urochloa grass-endophyte associations that had been maintained in a controlled environment were subjected to metabolic profiling analysis. Three individual plants (biological replicates) from each seed batch were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), with two technical replicates per plant. Additional plants representing the Humidicolal and Humidicola2 sub-groups identified in the SSR-based genetic diversity analysis were selected from seed batches 2, 4 and 8. Freeze-dried pseudostem samples were prepared for LC-MS analysis using an 80% methanol extraction procedure. 
 Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based on the full LC-MS dataset reveals differences in metabolic profiles of each Brachiaria-Urochloa grass-endophyte association analysed (Figure 7). Each of the associations forms a distinct cluster, indicating that there is limited variation within a species/population. As for the SSRbased genetic analysis, there are two separate B. humidicola populations, with Humidicolal samples forming a separate cluster to the remaining populations. The 3D

 PCT/AU2017/050848 
 -33PCA plot indicates that B. decumbens and B. brizantha associations share similar metabolic profiles as do Humidicola2 and U. mosambicensis associations. 
 The fungal endophyte-derived compound peramine, known to have insecticidal activity, was produced in planta and was thus identified in the metabolic profiles of the Urochloa mosambicensis grass-fungal endophyte associations (Figure 3). The presence of peramine was confirmed through MS (ions extracted at the mass-to-charge ratio [m/z] of 248). All samples of the Urochloa mosambicensis grass-fungal endophyte associations tested produced the endophyte-derived insecticidal compound peramine (Table 5 and 
 Figure 8).

Samples of Brachiaria-Urochloa grass-fungal endophyte associations were selected for metabolic profiling analysis. Three plants (biological replicates) from each group were analysed. Samples of the Urochloa mosambicensis grass-fungal endophyte associations tested produced the endophyte-derived insecticidal compound peramine.

 -34Example 5 - Antifungal Activity of endophytes isolated from Brachiaria/Urochloa species complex 
 A previous publication reported antifungal activity in the Acremonium implicatum endophytic fungus isolated from Brachiaria brizantha (Kelemu et al. 2001). To investigate antifungal activity in the endophytes isolated here, all 29 endophytic fungi were tested against 8 model test fungi: Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum graminicola, Rhizoctonia cerealis, Trichoderma harzianum, Phoma sorghina, Botrytis cinerea, Bipolaris portulaceae and Drechslera brizae. Petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar were inoculated with a central colony of each endophyte isolate, and incubated 10 days at 24°C. Two inoculum of a model test fungus were then placed on opposite sides of each dish. Cultures were incubated at room temperature in the dark during 5 days and the size of the zone of inhibition was visually assessed on a scale of 0-5 (0 - no inhibition; 1 - very weak inhibition; 2 - weak inhibition; 3 - moderate inhibition; 4 - strong inhibition; 5 - very strong inhibition. For each endophyte-fungal pathogen combination five replicates were scored and the scores averaged. Endophyte isolate 9.2.A displayed strong, broad spectrum antifungal activity, inhibiting growth of all but Botrytis cinerea and Trichoderma harzianum (Table 6, Figure 9). There were distinct differences in the level of antifungal activity across ITS groups - with group 3 (isolate 9.2.A) displaying the strongest, followed by group 2 (isolates 12.1.A and 12.1.D) and group 2 (5 isolates). Endophyte isolates within the ITS group 1 showed minimal inhibition of growth of pathogenic fungi (Table 6).

The size of the zone of inhibition was visually assessed on a scale of 0-5 (0 - no inhibition; 1 - very weak inhibition; 2 - weak inhibition; 3 - moderate inhibition; 4 - strong inhibition; 5 - very strong inhibition).

 Example 6 - Whole Genome Sequencing of Fungal Endophytes Isolated from 
 Brachiaria-Urochloa Grasses 
 Methodologies for whole genome sequencing of fungal endophytes based on massive parallelisation of sequencing reactions have been established using sequencing platforms such as the lllumina HiSeq2000. High quality genomic DNA is prepared from mycelia samples from fungal endophytes isolated from Brachiaria-Urochloa grasses, sub-cultured in liquid media. DNA from each fungal endophyte strain is prepared for sequencing using established methodologies. Samples may be sequenced in multiplex using an indexing approach. The lllumina HiSeq2000 platform is based upon sequencing by synthesis approach, where millions of DNA fragments are bound to the surface of a glass flow cell and then amplified in situ to produce a discrete cluster of DNA strands. Sequencing is achieved by the addition of polymerase and 4 nucleotides differentially fluorescently labelled with an inactive 3’-OH group that ensures only a single nucleotide is incorporated with each cycle. Each base-incorporation is followed by image capture and then chemical cleavage to remove the fluorescent dye to enable base extension. The sequence is compiled by image overlay after sequence cycling is completed. Compiled sequences are checked for quality prior to genome assembly and analysis. 
 Five endophyte isolates (1.1.A, 3.3.A, 5.1.Β, 9.2.A and 12.1 .E) were sequenced using the lllumina HiSeq2000 platform. Paired end reads from each isolate were used as input for de novo genome sequence assembly. Analysis of assembled sequenced revealed isolates from within the same ITS group showed similar sequence assembly characteristics (Table 7).

 To investigate the level of diversity among the 5 endophyte strains (1.1.A, 3.3.A, 5.1.B, 9.2.A and 12.1.E), the GAPDH gene was identified by using the Neurospora crassa GAPDH

 WO 2018/027276 
 PCT/AU2017/050848 cDNA sequence as a query in a BLASTn search of a sequence database comprising contigs from the 5 endophyte isolates. The GAPDH gene sequences were polymorphic between ITS groups, but highly similar within groups (Figure 10), suggesting isolates 3.3.A, 5.1.B and 12.1 .E may be the same strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the GAPDH protein confirmed the 3 ITS groups to which isolates 1.1.A, 9.2.A and 12.1.E belong to are divergent from one another and all other fungi within an in-house fungal database (Figure 11). 
 To further interrogate the level of diversity among the 3 isolates belonging to ITS group 1, the Epichloe festucae peramine A gene (perA) (GenBank Accession # BAE06845) and homologous genes within ITS group 1 endophytes 3.3.A, 5.1.B and 12.1 .E were aligned. Sequence polymorphism was observed within ITS group 1 isolates possibly suggesting different strains (Figure 12). 
 Example 7 - Molecular Taxonomy and Morphological Analysis 
 Methods for Molecular Taxonomy 
 Genomic DNA was extracted from lyophilized fungal mycelia by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction method, and the quality and quantity of the DNA was assessed by both agarose gel electrophoresis and specific absorbance measurements using the NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The entire region of nuclear ribosomal DNA which comprises both internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 and the 5.8S subunit was PCR-amplified using primers ITS5 and ITS4. Purified PCR amplification products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing technology. Sequence data was used in BLASTN analysis to identify matches in the NCBI database. 
 For each fungal DNA sample, paired-end libraries with inserts c. 400 bp in size were prepared using the standard protocol (TruSeq DNA Sample Prep V2 Low Throughput: lllumina Inc., San Diego, USA) with paired-end adaptors. Library quantification was performed using the ΚΑΡΑ library quantification kit (ΚΑΡΑ Biosystems, Boston, USA). Paired-end libraries were pooled according to the nature of the attached adaptors and sequence analysed using the HiSeq2000 platform (lllumina Inc.), following the standard manufacturer’s protocol. All generated sequence reads were assured by filtering and

 WO 2018/027276 
 PCT/AU2017/050848 trimming of reads based on quality using a custom Python script, which calculates quality statistics and stores trimmed reads in several fastq files. 
 In order to assemble each of the interested gene sequence such as 18S, 28S, tub2, and tefA, matching reads for each gene were identified from the database of all trimmed reads for each fungal genome, through BLASTN using gene sequence from a closely related species as the reference, and defining the E value threshold as 0.1. From this BLAST output, all corresponding paired reads (both forward and reverse) were extracted from the database, and gene assembly was performed using the Linux based de novo assemblers Velvet ver.1.2.10. Different hash lengths (K-mer sizes) ranging from 21 to 61 were tested as appropriate for different sequence read sets, and the minimum contig length was always defined as 100 bp. Values for estimated coverage and coverage cut-off were set to auto. 
 Multiple alignments of the complete gene sequences for each gene were performed individually using ClustalW with default parameters. To reconstruct tree topology, maximum likelihood method was used as implemented in MEGA 5.2 with default parameters and 500 bootstrap replicates. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated during the analysis. 
 Methods for Morphological Analysis 
 For morphological characterisation, the isolates were examined on oatmeal agar (OA: 30 g oat flakes, 20 g agar, 1 L distilled water), potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco Laboratories) and malt extract agar (MEA). Cultures were incubated in the dark at 25°C. Colony diameters were measured at 9 days and again at 24 days (three replicates per isolate/medium combination). Colony colours were determined at 24 days growth. In descriptions (following), colour colony codes in parenthesis refer to Kornerup and Wanscher (1978): Methuen Handbook of Colour, 3 rd  Edition, Methuen London. The microscopic features were examined and measured in lactic acid under a light microscope (Olympus BX-50) using oil immersion (x1000).

 Phialides solitary, arising at right angles directly from aerial hyphae, very long and slender, 72-115 x 0.7-1.0 pm, no basal septum. Conidia formed in globose slimy heads. Conidia cylindrical, smooth-walled, 1-celled, 3.5-5.5 x 1.0-1.5(-2.0) pm (Figure 24). 
 Group 03 - Type specimen isolate 9.2A - Suggested taxonomy 
 Based on the above, the suggested taxonomy is Simplicillium sp. The phialides are much longer than other described species; 9.2A may also be a closely related species of Simplicillium. 
 Group 04-Type specimen isolate 12.1A- Molecular taxonomy 
 ITS sequence comparison for 12.1 A using sequences from TYPE material provided 99% match to Emericellopsis humicola [CBS 180.56, associated with the seaweed Fucus, TYPE, (AY632659.1)] with 93% coverage, 98% match to Acremonium exuviarum [a lizardassociated fungus with affinity to Emericellopsis', TYPE (NR 077167.1)] with 98% coverage and 97% match to Emericellopsis glabra [CBS 119.40, associated with the seaweed Fucus, TYPE (AY632657.1)] with 93% coverage. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed for 12.1 A fungal strain and Emericellopsis species based on partial sequences for ITS (Figure 25) and tub2 (Figure 26), gene using the Maximum Likelihood method as implemented in MEGA 5.2. Both phylograms revealed a similar topology indicating unique nature of the 12.1 A genome.

 Brachiaria host panel 
 A host panel comprising commercially relevant Brachiaria-Urochloa germplasm was established to enable inoculation of genetically novel and highly diverse endophyte isolates into a single host genotype. An optimised method for endophyte inoculation into host plants free of microbial organisms in axenic conditions was developed, facilitating a high frequency of successful inoculation (i.e. as above; Figure 6). 
 The host panel represents a wide variety of cultivars of commercial relevance, including 10 Brachiaria distachya, Brachiaria decumbens, Hybrid brachiaria, Urochloa mosambicensis, 
 Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria humidicola. 
 Endophyte inoculation into the Brachiaria-Urochloa host panel 
 Selected endophyte strains were inoculated into the host panel to create a matrix of Brachiaria-Urochloa species-endophyte associations. Approximately 50 inoculations were performed for each endophyte strain (Table 9). Commercial Brachiaria species and endophyte isolates with greatest commercial application (inoculation efficiency) were prioritised in developing this matrix.

 Endophyte inoculation frequency was determined for each candidate endophyte, approximately 6 months post inoculation, using a diagnostic (i.e. specific allele sizes at each SSR loci for each endophyte) set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for each endophyte isolate. 
 Successful inoculation was achieved for representative endophytes from ribosomal DNA sequence-defined clades 1, 2 and 4 (Table 10). Data for Table 10 is for stable BrachiariaUrochloa endophyte associations identified 3 to 6 months post inoculation. A diagnostic set of SSR markers specific for Brachiaria-Urochloa endophytes are used to test for endophyte presence and identity in planta. Shown is the percentage of endophyte positive plants identified from the total number of plants harvested. The Brachiaria-Urochloa species from which the endophyte was isolated is highlighted in light grey.

 Variation between endophyte isolates representing different ITS groups was observed. ITS2 (12.1.B) > ITS1 (5.1.B) > ITS2 (1.1.A) > ITS3 (12.1.A)> ITS4 (9.2.A). Cross species compatibility was also observed. In this study, isolates 5.1.B and 12.1 .B exhibit broader compatibility compared to the moderately compatible 1.1.A and 12.1.A. No associations were identified for candidate endophyte 9.2A (ITS3), most likely due to the observed detrimental effect of this endophyte on plant survival following inoculation.

 Example 9 - Methods for determining the physical nature of Brachiaria endophyte in planta 
 Distribution of inoculated endophyte in the brachiaria host plant 
 The distribution of Brachiaria-Urochloa endophytes in planta was determined for selected endophyte strains. To characterise the distribution of these endophytes without the confounding effects of the presence of other fungal endophytes, isolates were inoculated into the Brachiaria-Urochloa host panel (as described above in example 8). The distribution of endophyte strains 5.1.B (ITS1) and 12.1 .B (ITS2) was determined through molecular analysis for the presence of endophyte in different organs/tissues of endophyte inoculated mature Brachiaria plants. Tissues analysed represent the entire host plant: fine brown roots (FR), white roots (WR), lower pseudostem (LP), mid pseudostem (MP), upper pseudostem (UP), leaves (L), and, where available, inflorescence (I) (Figure 28). 
 For each host-endophyte combination 2-5 plants were tested independently. Samples were analysed in replicate and 50-60 mg of (dry weight) plant material was used for each sample. Harvested plant material was freeze-dried, and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy plant 96 kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s recommended method. Purified DNA was stored at -20°C. 
 For each sample, endophyte presence was detected by amplicon generation from total genomic DNA template with endophyte strain specific SSR markers. PCR amplification was performed in a 20 pL reaction containing 5 pL genomic DNA (5-10 ng), 1 X PCR buffer (Bioline, London, UK), 0.2 mM of each dNTP (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK), 0.5 U Immolase (Bioline), and 0.25 pM each primer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA; Invitrogen, Van Allen Way, Carlsbad, USA). Cycling conditions for each reaction consisted of 10 min at 95°C followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 60 s at the initial annealing temperature (65°C), (reducing the temperature at 1°C per cycle), and 1 min at 72°C followed by 20 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 60 s at the final annealing temperature (55°C), and 1 min at 72°C followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Templates from predetermined endophyte-positive and -negative plant genotypes were included as controls.

 Amplification products were diluted with sterile ultrapure water (Sartorius AG) at a ratio of 1:10, and 2 pL of the diluted product was mixed with 7.95 pL Hi-Di Formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.05 pL 500 LIZ (Applied Biosystems) size standard before analysing on the ABI 3730x1 automated capillary electrophoresis platform (Applied Biosystems). Products were detected using the GeneMapper version 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems, 2004), and endophyte-positive samples were identified by the presence of amplification peaks, specific to a minimum of two of the strain specific SSR markers. 
 The distribution of selected candidate endophytes is summarised in Table 11 (Codes for tissue/organ type are described in Figure 28). Endophyte strain 5.1.B appears to be predominately located in the roots of B. humidicola. Endophyte strain 12.1 .B appears to be distributed throughout the host plants tested, B. humidicola and B. decumbens. Further characterisation of the inflorescence is required to determine endophyte presence in this organ.

 The presence of endophyte strains was further confirmed by microscopic examination. Pseudostem samples prepared using a modified procedure described by Hignight et al. (1993). Briefly, samples were killed and fixed in Carnoy’s solution (6:3:1 ethyl alcohol: chloroform: 85% glacial acetic acid) for 24 hr, stained in aniline blue and cleared using a gradient of methyl salicylate:ethyl alcohol. Root samples were fixed and stained with aniline blue. Endophyte strain 12.1 .B was observed in root and pseudostem tissue of B. humidicola by microscopic examination (Figure 29).

 Re-isolation of inoculated fungal endophytes 
 Inoculated fungal endophytes 5.1.B and 12.1.B were directly isolated from pseudostem and root tissue. Five tillers as well as root material were removed from each endophyte inoculated Brachiaria plant and washed in running tap water to remove any visible dirt. The tissue pieces were surface-sterilised with 80% (v/v) ethanol for 2 minutes, followed by 5% (w/v) NaOCI (bleach) for 5 minutes in a laminar flow cabinet. Subsequently, tissue pieces were rinsed three times in sterile water to remove any residual bleach, and allowed to completely dry on sterile paper (Whatman Qualitative 3, 9 cm diameter), with the bottom of the tiller facing to the front of the laminar flow hood. Both the root and the tiller material was chopped into approximately 2 mm pieces and placed downwards on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 250 mg/l cefotaxime. Petri dishes were sealed and incubated at 25°C for up to 4 weeks, and monitored for contamination on each day. Outgrowing mycelium was sub-cultured onto new PDA medium and incubated at 22°C in the dark. 
 Strain identity will be confirmed by ITS sequence analysis and strain specific SSR analysis. 
 It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in this specification extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.
