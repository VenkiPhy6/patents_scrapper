 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 The present disclosure relates to a novel microorganism of the family Sporichthyaceae and use thereof. 
 A microorganism deposit was deposited on Jun. 8, 2016 in accordance with the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure. The deposit was identified as  Epidermidibacterium keratini  EPI-7 with an Accession number at the International Depository Authority of KCCM11843P.

 BACKGROUND ART 
 The skin ecosystem provides diverse habitats for microorganisms, and a wide range of microorganisms occupy the skin ecosystem. It is known that these microorganisms have a symbiotic relationship with their human hosts and have many positive effects on the hosts. The skin forms a variety of habitats, such as invaginations, specified niches, etc., which help a wide range of microorganisms grow. The primary role of the skin is to form a physical barrier and to offer protection against a potential threat from the external environment and toxic substances. The skin is an interface with the external environment and is colonized by a diverse collection of microorganisms (fungi, bacteria, viruses, and small larvae). The microorganisms that are adapted to the niche they inhabit are selected according to selection of physical and chemical functions. In general, the skin is cool, acidic, and maintained in a dry state. Structurally, the epidermis plays a role in forming a physical barrier and resisting penetration by microorganisms and toxins while retaining moisture. The outermost layer of the epidermis is composed of the stratum corneum. The epidermis forms a so-called “brick and mortar” structure, the skin tissue undergoes continuous self-renewal, and squames are constantly shed from the skin surface at the final stage of differentiation. 
 Probiotics, collectively refers to microorganisms which have beneficial effects on the human body, and are microorganisms that offer benefit to our bodies. Most probiotics known to date are lactic acid bacteria. Probiotics have been reported to show efficacy through various beneficial effects on the human body, but there are few studies on a correlation between skin flora and skin. 
 The skin barrier consists of dead keratinocytes and intercellular lipids. The skin barrier is a skin protection layer that protects the skin against external stimuli and prevents evaporation of water through the skin, and plays a key role in maintaining skin health. That is, the skin barrier prevents excessive loss of water from the body and entry of harmful substances such as chemicals or microorganisms. Keratinocyte envelopes constituting the surface of dead keratinocytes play an important role in the stability of intercellular lipids. Keratinocytes undergo differentiation to form skin barriers through cornification. Functions of the skin barrier may be destroyed with aging or by external factors, and damage of the skin barrier may cause water loss of the skin and wrinkles. 
 Accordingly, the present inventors examined what changes occur in the skin according to changes of skin flora, and moreover, they studied whether the skin environment may be potentially improved by inducing changes of skin flora. As a result, a novel microorganism of the family Sporichthyaceae was isolated and identified from the skin of a healthy adult, and it was found that the novel microorganism or a culture thereof may induce changes in a skin microbial community so as to improve the skin environment, and may be used in skin-related conditions, thereby completing the present invention.

In general, to produce foods or beverages, the composition of the present disclosure may be added in an amount of 15 parts by weight or less with respect to a raw material. There is no particular limitation in kinds of the health functional food. Of the kinds of the health functional food, a beverage composition may include various flavors or natural carbohydrates as an additional ingredient, like common beverages. The natural carbohydrates include monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose, disaccharides such as maltose and sucrose, polysaccharides such as dextrin and cyclodextrin, and sugar alcohols such as xylitol, sorbitol, and erythritol.

 BEST MODE 
 Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail with reference to Examples. However, these Examples are for illustrative purposes only, and the scope of the present disclosure is not intended to be limited by these Examples. 
 Example 1. Isolation of Microorganism 
 A sample (human epidermal keratinocyte) obtained by washing the skin of a healthy woman with sterile distilled water was seeded in a Reasoner's 2A (R2A) medium (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.). After seeding, the sample was incubated for 48 hours in an incubator at 28° C., and 100 colonies were isolated and cultured, followed by re-incubation for 48 hours in an incubator at 28° C. The completely cultured colonies were identified by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Primers (SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 3) used at this time were designed to react and amplify only in bacteria. PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles of at 95° C. for 1 min, at 55° C. for 1 min, and at 75° C. for 1 min and 30 sec, and lastly, at 72° C. for 8 min. A product was stored at 4° C. DNA sequences of species isolated and cultured after PCR reaction were determined by using an ABI-3730XL (ABI, USA). Nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA regions determined in the isolated and cultured colonies of the microorganisms were compared with those of other strains registered in the BLAST program provided through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s homepage. Only novel species with homology of 97% or less were selected and used, and of them, a novel microorganism with homology of 94% or less (hereinafter, referred to as “EPI-7”) was selected. EPI-7 has a 16s rRNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (complementary DNA). 
 Example 2. Phylogenetic and Mycological Characteristics of Novel Microorganism 
 2.1. Phylogenetic Characteristics 
 16S rRNA homology analysis was calculated using an ExTaxon-e server (Yoon S. H et al., (2017)). Sequence data were aligned using a software package BioEdit (Hall T. A. (1999)), and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA version 5.05 (Tamura, K et al. (2011)). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Neighbor-joining (Sitouand Nei (1987)), maximum-likelihood, and maximum-parsimony algorithms, and stability of the phylogenetic trees was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications) (Felsenstein 1985). 
 As a result, EPI-7 was found to have 93.4%, 93.2%, 93.0%, 93.0%, and 92.9% homology with  Modestobacter lapidis  MON 3.1 ,  Sporichthya polymorpha      DSM  43042 , Modestobacter marinus  42H12-1 , Modestobacter roseus  KLBMP1279, and  Modestobacter versicolor  CP153-2, respectively. As shown in  FIG.  1   , results of a constructed phylogenetic tree showed that EPI-7 is a novel microorganism belonging to the family Sporichthyaceae, which has not yet been reported. 
 2.2. Mycological Characteristics 
 2.2.1. Morphological Characteristics 
 Morphological characteristics of EPI-7 were analyzed as follows. 
 First, cell morphology of EPI-7 was observed under an Olympus microscope (GX71) at magnification of 1000× after culturing cells in R2A medium at 25° C. for 5 days. Gliding motility was investigated by subjecting a hanging-drop technique to fresh EPI-7 cells in R2A medium. 
 For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a sample was pretreated as follows. EPI-7 was seeded on R2A (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) solid medium and incubated for 3 days, and then a membrane filter was attached to formed colonies. 
 The membrane filter having colonies attached thereto was separated and fixed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 2 hours, and then washed with PBS for 5 minutes twice. 
 Thereafter, the membrane filter was treated with a 2% osmium tetroxide solution for 1 hour, and dehydrated with 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol. The dehydrated sample was treated with isoamylacetate to remove ethanol therefrom. The pre-treated sample was naturally dried, and sputtered with gold by using a sputter coater (SC502, Polaron). Thereafter, the sample was photographed using SEM (Hitachi S4300N, Hitachi, Japan) at magnification of 1000× and 100000×, and results are shown in  FIG.  2   . 
 To distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, experiments were performed as follows. 
 In detail, one colony of EPI-7 cultured well on the R2A solid medium was collected and fixed on a slide glass. The slide glass was completely dried, and then stained with crystal violet for 1 to 2 minutes, and washed with running water and dried again. 
 The dried slide was stained with iodine-potassium iodide for 1 minute. Thereafter, the slide was destained with ethyl alcohol, and washed with running water, followed by drying. To determine whether the sample was Gram-positive or -negative, secondary staining was performed using a red staining dye such as Safranin for 1 to 3 minutes, and the slide was washed with water and observed under a microscope (Olympus microscope, 12 GX71). 
 As a result, EPI-7 was found to have the following morphological characteristics: 
 (1) rod-shaped; 
 (2) non-motile; 
 (3) no flagella; 
 (4) Gram-positive; 
 (5) non-spore-forming; 
 (6) 0.5 μm to 0.3 μm in length, and 0.3 μm to 0.1 μm in diameter; and 
 (7) colonies are round, convex, and pale yellow. 
 2.2.2. Cultural and Physiological Characteristics 
 To investigate culture conditions of EPI-7, an optimum culture temperature was determined by setting an optimum growth temperature from 5° C. to 40° C. (5° C. intervals), and an optimum salt concentration was determined by adding NaCl of 0% (w/v) to 15% (w/v) (0.5% interval) to a medium and then culturing at 25° C. for 5 days. 
 pH was determined by using the following buffer system; sodium acetate/acetic acid (pH<6), Tris/HCl ( pH  6 to pH 9), and glycine/sodium hydroxide (pH>9). 
 Further, catalase activity was determined by analyzing bubble generation in 3% (v/v) H 2 O 2 , and oxidase activity was determined by using 1% (w/v) tetramethyl phenylenediamine. 
 Further, in order to test growth media, nutrient agar (NA), yeast extract malt extract agar (ISP 2), and trypticase soy agar medium (BD, USA) were used for culturing at 25° C. for 5 days. 
 Further, BioLog GP2, BioLog Gen III, API 20NE, and API ZYM (biomeriuex, France) were used to investigate substance utilization of EPI-7. A method of use was performed according to the manual provided by the manufacturer. When a positive reaction occurs, a violet color develops. After examination with the naked eye, the degree of growth was accurately determined using a microplate spectrophotometer. An API ZYM test was analyzed after incubation at 25° C. for 4 hours, and another API test was analyzed after incubation at 25° C. for at least 48 hours. Results of a comparison with other species are shown in the following Table 1. 
 Anaerobic growth was examined in serum bottles by adding sodium thioglycollate (1 g/l) to R2A medium, and replacing the upper air layer with nitrogen gas. 
 Tests for degradability of DNA, casein, starch,  tween  80, and carboxymethyl cellulose were performed after incubation at 25° C. for 7 days.

 2.2.3. Biochemical Characteristics 
 A DNA G+C content of EPI-7 was analyzed by HPLC. In detail, experimental methods and conditions for analyzing a cellular fatty acid composition, a G+C composition, and quinone are as follows. 
 First, the cellular fatty acid composition of the isolated microorganism was analyzed according to Miller's method. About 40 mg of cultured cells were transferred to a tube, and 1 ml of a solution prepared by adding 15% NaOH to 50% methanol was added thereto, and the tube was heated to 100° C. for 30 minutes and cooled at room temperature. 2 ml of methanolic-HCl (a mixture of 325 ml of 6.0 N HCl and 275 ml of methanol) was added to the tube, which was then heated at 80° C. for 10 minutes, and then rapidly cooled. 1.25 ml of hexane/methyl-tert-butylether (1:1, v/v) was added thereto, and mixed well for 10 minutes. After being left at room temperature, when the reaction solution was separated into 2 layers, a lower layer was removed, and 3 ml of dilute NaOH (10.8 g of NaOH/900 ml of D.W) was added and mixed well for 10 minutes and left at room temperature. About ⅔ of a supernatant was transferred to a screw-capped sample vial (12×32 mm, Agilent technologies), and capped, and then used as a sample. The sample was subjected to saponification, methylation, and extraction according to a standard protocol of Sherlock MIS Software. Fatty acids were analyzed by using an Agilent Technologies 6890 Gas Chromatograph, an A30 m×0.320 mm×0.25 μm methyl siloxane column (HP-1), and the TSBA40 database (MIDI, Version 4.5) of the MIS package was used to identify the fatty acids. 
 All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the results are shown in the following Table 2. 
 Further, G+C mol % was analyzed as follows. A DNA solution extracted from the microorganism was transferred to a microtube, and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes. 
 Thereafter, 100 μl of a supernatant was collected and transferred to a new tube, and DNA denaturation was performed at 100° C. for 5 minutes, and then cooled. 10 μl (0.1 mg/mL) of P1 nuclease was added thereto, and allowed to react at 50° C. for 3 hours. Alkaline phosphatase (10 μl of buffer, and 5 μl of phosphatase) was added thereto, followed by incubation at 37° C. overnight. After centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes, analysis was performed under the following conditions: 
 HPLC: YOUNG LIN YL9100 (YL9111 Binary pump) 
 Detector: YOUNG LIN YL9120 UV/Vis Detector 
 Chromatograph data system: YOUNG LIN Autochro-3000 
 Analysis column:  Waters Spherisorb  5  um ODS  2 4.6 mm×250 mm column 
 Eluent: 0.02M NH 4 H 2 PO 4  (pH non-adjusted)-acetonitrile (20:1, v/v) 
 Flow rate: 0.5 mL/min 
 Detection wavelength: 270 nm 
 Quinone was analyzed as follows: The microorganism was cultured at 25° C. for 96 hours in R2A medium and then only cells were collected therefrom and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried sample was extracted under the following conditions: Chloroform:methanol (2:1) solution was added and shaken for 3 to 4 hours. Cells were filtered out using a filter paper (whatman No. 2) and a filtrate was concentrated. Thereafter, the concentrate was dissolved in 100 μl of Chloroform:methanol (8.5:1.5), and then centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes to collect a supernatant, which was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC conditions were as follows: 
 HPLC: YOUNG LIN YL9100 (YL9111 Binary pump) 
 Detector: YOUNG LIN YL9120 UV/Vis Detector 
 Chromatograph data system: YOUNG LIN Autochro-3000 
 Analysis column:  Waters Spherisorb  5  um ODS  2 4.6 mm×150 mm column (column temp. 40° C.) 
 Analysis solvent: methanol:isopropyl ether (4:1) 
 Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min 
 Detection wavelength: 254 mm. 
 Polar lipid analysis was performed after culturing the microorganism at 25° C. for 96 hours in R2A medium. First, polar lipids were extracted from the microorganism according to a method described in Minnikin D. E. et al. (1984)( J Microbiol Methods  2, 233-241). Thereafter, polar lipids were identified by two-dimensional TLC (Komakata K et al., 1987,  Methods Microbiol  19, 161-206).

 As shown in Table 3, EPI-7 is different from the closest species in terms of major biochemical characteristics, and these chemotaxonomic results and the phylogenetic results of Example 2.1. demonstrate that EPI-7 is a new species. 
 Taken together, it was demonstrated that EPI-7 isolated from human epidermal keratinocytes is a microorganism of a novel genus belonging to the family Sporichthyaceae, and designated as  Epidermidibacterium  gen.nov. according to the phylogenetic nomenclature;  Epidermidibacterium  [E.pi.der.mi.di.bac.te'ri.um. N.L. n. epidermis, -idis skin; L. neut. n. bacterium, (a small rod or staff); N.L. neut. ( Epidermidibacterium  a small rod from the skin)]. 
 Further, as confirmed in Example 2 , Epidermidibacterium  gen.nov. has the following characteristics: 
 (1) rod-shaped; 
 (2) non-motile; 
 (3) Gram-positive; 
 (4) non-spore-forming; 
 (5) oxidase- and/or catalase-negative; 
 (7) MK-9(H4) is detectable therefrom; 
 (8) major polar lipids are PE, PI, PG, PC, and three UL; and 
 (9) a DNA G+C content of 68.9 mol %. 
 Subsequently, the above results demonstrated that the  Epidermidibacterium  gen.nov. strain isolated from human epidermal keratinocytes is one species, which was designated as  Epidermidibacterium keratini  sp. nov according to the phylogenetic nomenclature; 
   Epidermidibacterium keratini  (ke.ra.ti'ni. N.L. gen. neut. n.  keratini  pertaining to keratin). 
 Further, as confirmed in Example 2 , Epidermidibacterium keratini  has the following characteristics in addition to the characteristics of the  Epidermidibacterium  gen.nov: 
 (1) 0.5 μm to 0.3 μm in length, and 0.3 μm to 0.1 μm in diameter;

 The present inventors deposited the  Epidermidibacterium keratini  strain belonging to the genus  Epidermidibacterium  at the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (KCCM) in the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology on Jun. 8, 2016 with Accession NO: KCCM 11843P. 
 Example 3. Activity of Microorganism 
 3.1. Analysis of Skin-Microbiome Change 
 In order to measure the effect of EPI-7 on changes of skin flora, changes of the skin microbiome of a subject was analyzed. 
 In detail, EPI-7 culture was applied to the skin of the subject at 6-hr intervals, and skin samples were collected for a total of 72 hours and analyzed. Samples were collected before treatment of the culture (Epidermis A) and at 72 hours after treatment of the culture (Epidermis B). The samples were collected using sterile water and a scraper, and all procedures were performed on a clean bench. The samples collected from the skin were suspended in 0.85% NaCl, and supernatants were centrifuged (17,000 rpm/m) to collect cells therefrom. The cells were washed once with sterile physiological saline. Thereafter, DNA was extracted using a FastDNA SPIN KIT (MP Biomedical, France). For amplification of 16S ribosomal DNA genes of the extracted DNA, GC clamp (SEQ ID NO: 4)-attached 341F (SEQ ID NO: 5) and 518R (SEQ ID NO: 6) were used. For a PCR reaction, 0.4 mM dNTP, 0.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 10 μl of 4 mM Mg 2+ -containing Takara Perfect Premix (Takara, Japan) were mixed with 1 μl of a DNA template (20 μg/mL), and 1 μl each of 1.0 μM forward primer and 1.0 μM reverse primer. Sterile water was added to the mixture to a total volume of 20 μl. The PCR reaction was performed in a C1000-Dual (Bio-Rad, USA) by touchdown PCR in which temperature was decreased from 64° C. to 59° C. every 2 cycles, and the PCR mixture was finally treated at 72° C. for 8 minutes, and stored at 4° C. 
 Thereafter, the resulting PCR product was used in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. In the DGGE analysis, a D-code system (Bio-rad, USA) was used. A concentration of a polyacrylamide gel used was 8%, and 40% polyacrylamide bis-solution (29:1, 3.3% C) (Bio-Rad, USA) was used to prepare a gel with a vertical concentration gradient of 40-60%. At this time, 7 M urea and 40% (w/v) formamide (Sigma, USA) were used as a denaturant. The D-code system was filled with about 7 L of TAE buffer (20 mM Tris, 10 mM acetic acid, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and equal amounts of 2× loading dye (0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 70% glycerol) and the PCR product were mixed and electrophoresed at 50 V for 800 minutes. The electrophoresed polyacrylamide gel was stained with a Redsafe (Intron, Korea) solution for 15 minutes, and specific bands which appeared were analyzed. Results are shown in  FIG.  3   . Further, images of DGGE bands were quantified and analyzed using GelCompar2 (Bionumeric, Belgium) to generate a histogram. For sequencing analysis, the DGGE gel bands were sent to Macrogen Inc., and results are shown in  FIG.  4   . 
 As shown in  FIGS.  3  and  4   , a decreased number of bands and strong expression of particular bands were observed in Epidermis B (after treatment of the culture), as compared to Epidermis A (before treatment of the culture). 
 The increased expression of bands indicates an increase in population. Most of the DGGE bands with increased intensity indicated microorganisms of the genus  staphylococcus , which belong to skin flora symbiotic with the skin and effective in strengthening the skin barrier and moisturizing the skin. 
 These results suggest that EPI-7 influences strengthening of the skin barrier and moisturizing of the skin by increasing the microorganisms. 
 3.2. Analysis of Skin Wound Healing, Skin Barrier Strengthening, and Moisturizing Activities 
 In order to analyze skin wound healing, skin barrier strengthening, and moisturizing activities, expression levels of filaggrin, hyaluronic acid synthase3 (HAS3),  claudin  1,  claudin  4, αSMase, aquaporin 3 (AQP3)  transglutaminase  1, and CerS3, which are skin barrier strengthening and moisturizing activity-related factors, in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) were examined, according to EPI-7 treatment, by RT-PCR. 
 In detail, HaCaT cells, which are human keratinocytes, were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM (Dulbecco'smodified Eagle's Medium, Gibco 1210-0038), and culturing was carried out in an incubator at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The cultured cell line was treated with 1 mM retinol as a positive control group. As another positive control group, 20 ml of the cell culture was treated with cultures of  Bifidobacterium animalis  (UB) and  Lactobacillus acidophilus  (AB) at a concentration of 1%. Further, EPI-7 cultures were treated at a concentration of 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0%. 
 Thereafter, HaCaT cells were further incubated for 24 hours, and recovered, and 1 ml of trizol (RNAiso, DAKARA, Japan) was added thereto to isolate RNA. Further, for RT-PCR, RNA was quantified by using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo, USA), and reacted at 42° C. for 55 minutes and at 70° C. for 15 minutes to synthesize cDNA (Reverse Transcriptase Mix, ELPIS biotech, Korea). RT-PCR was performed by using Step One Plus (Applied Biosystems, USA), and SYBR Green supermix (Applied Biosystems, USA) was added together with primers and cDNA. Polymerase was activated at 94° C. for 5 minutes and then polymerization was performed at 95° C. for 30 seconds, at 54° C. for 1 minute, and at 72° C. for 1 minute, for 40 cycles. 
 Primers of SEQ ID NOS: 7 and 8 were used for filaggrin, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 9 and 10 for HAS3, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 11 and 12 for  claudin  1, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 13 and 14 for  claudin  4, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 15 and 16 for αSMase, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 17 and 18 for AQP3, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 19 and 20 for  transglutaminase  1, primers of SEQ ID NOS: 21 and 22 for CerS3, and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 23 and 24 for beta-actin.

   FIG.  16    is a graph showing the effects of different doses of EPI-7 on  aquaporin  3 expression in human keratinocytes. 
 As shown in  FIG.  5   , EPI-7 was found to significantly increase expression of filaggrin which is a keratinocyte differentiation marker and a precursor protein of a natural moisturizing factor responsible for moisturizing the skin surface. 
 As shown in  FIGS.  6 ,  7 , and  15   , EPI-7 was found to significantly increase expression of    claudin    1 and 4, which are tight junction structures responsible for protecting the internal organs from the external environment and maintaining homeostasis of the human body. 
 As shown in  FIGS.  8  and  11   , EPI-7 was found to significantly increase expression of CerS3 and αSMase, which are enzymes essential for ceramide synthesis. 
 As shown in  FIGS.  12  and  13   , EPI-7 was found to significantly increase expression of HAS3, which is responsible for synthesis of hyaluronic acid which is an extracellular matrix component maintaining skin moisture, and showed higher efficacy than the positive control, retinol. 
 As shown in  FIG.  14   , EPI-7 was found to significantly increase expression of  transglutaminase  1, which plays a critical role in forming cornified envelopes. 
 As shown in  FIG.  16   , EPI-7 was found to significantly increase expression of AQP3, which plays a role in providing water for the human skin, functions as a water channel to facilitate cell migration, and functions as a glycerol transporter to regulate keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, thereby treating wounds. 
 Taken together, it can be seen that EPI-7 enhances the flexibility and firmness of the skin, improves the skin's water retention ability so as to exhibit a skin moisturizing effect, strengthens the skin barrier function by more effectively controlling intercellular adhesion and migration of water-containing solutes and water through the periplasmic space, and increases proliferation, differentiation, and migration of keratinocytes to exhibit a significant effect on wound healing. 
 3.3. Analysis of Anti-Inflammatory Activity in Skin 
 In order to analyze anti-inflammatory activity of EPI-7, HaCaT cells were treated with  Staphylococcus aureus  ( S. aureus ), which is an inflammation inducer, and  S. epidermidis  and EPI-7 were co-cultured with human HaCaT cells, and then mRNA expression levels of inflammatory factors were assessed. 
 In detail, HaCaT cells were cultured and seeded on a 6-well plate. 24 hours later, a micromembrane well was placed on the top of a cell single layer, and then living cells (SA:  S. aureus , SA_SE:  S. aureus+S. epidermidis , SA_EPI-7:  S. aureus +EPI-7) were seeded at a cell density of 1.0×10 14 . 
 The cells were further co-cultured for 24 hours, and then the cells and medium were removed. RT-PCR was performed in the same manner as in Example 3.2., except that a combination of SEQ ID NOS: 25 and 26, a combination of SEQ ID NOS: 27 and 28, a combination of SEQ ID NOS: 29 and 30, and a combination of SEQ ID NOS: 31 and 32 were used as primers for TNF-α, IL-1a, TSLP, and DDIT3, respectively. Results are shown in  FIG.  17   . 
   FIG.  17    is a graph showing effects of EPI-7 on inflammatory factors. 
 As shown in  FIG.  7   , EPI-7 was found to significantly inhibit expression of TNF-α, IL-1a, TSLP, and DDIT3, which are skin inflammatory factors. This result suggests that EPI-7 and the culture thereof may be used for skin inflammation-related diseases. 
 3.4. Analysis of Antipruritic Activity in Skin 
 In order to analyze antipruritic activity of EPI-7, mRNA expression levels of TSLP (Thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and TARC (Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine), which are pruritic factors, were assessed. In detail, HaCaT cells were treated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which is a synthetic ribonucleic acid that induces interferon production, and then cultured for 24 hours to stimulate HaCaT cells. Aged cells by stimulation were treated with the EPI-7 culture at a concentration of 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0%, and further cultured for 24 hours. RT-PCR was performed in the same manner as in Example 3.3., except that a combination of SEQ ID NOS: 33 and 34 was used as TARC primers. 
 Results are shown in  FIGS.  18  and  19   . 
   FIG.  18    is a graph showing the effects of different doses of EPI-7 on TSLP expression in human keratinocytes. 
   FIG.  19    is a graph showing the effects of different doses of EPI-7 on TARC expression in human keratinocytes. 
 As shown in  FIGS.  18  and  19   , EPI-7 was found to significantly decrease expression of TSLP and TARC, which are pruritic factors. This result suggests that EPI-7 and the culture thereof may be used for skin inflammation-related diseases and pruritus. 
 3.5. Analysis of Cytotoxicity 
 In order to examine cytotoxicity of EPI-7, an MTT assay was performed. 
 In detail, HaCaT cells were prepared in the same manner as in Example 3.1., and dispensed in a 96-well plate at a density of 3×10 4  cells/well. 24 hours later, a FBS-free medium was replaced. An EPI-7 culture was diluted with the FBS-free medium at concentrations of 0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, 10%, and 50%, and used to treat the cells. After incubation for 24 hours, the medium was removed, and 0.5 μg/mL of MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) reagent was added to crystallize the cells, followed by further incubation for 4 hours. After removing the MTT reagent, crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). Absorbance at 540 nm was measured, and compared with a non-treatment group to measure cell viability. Results are shown in  FIG.  20   . 
   FIG.  20    is a graph showing the effect of EPI-7 on cell viability. 
 As shown in  FIG.  20   , EPI-7 was found to have no cytotoxicity even at high concentrations. 
   FIG.  21    is a copy of Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure.
