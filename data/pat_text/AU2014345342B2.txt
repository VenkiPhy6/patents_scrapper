 COMPOSITION COMPRISING LACTOBACILLUS PLANTARUM 
 Technical Field of the Invention 
 The invention relates to a probiotic composition which is useful in the management of cholesterol levels. 
 Background to the Invention 
 Probiotics are bacteria which confer health benefits to a host. Typically, cultures of probiotic bacterial strains are consumed or administered to individuals in order to supplement the naturally occurring bacteria population of the gut. A number of health benefits have been associated with probiotics, including reducing the incidence of cancer, diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome to name a few. Probiotics have the potential to help in the management in a number of physiological conditions and act to reduce the absorption of certain ingested substances, such as lipids. Preliminary studies also indicate that probiotics can be useful in reducing serum levels of cholesterol and blood pressure and help modulate diabetes and reduce weight. 
 The provision of new probiotic compositions which can reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the gut would be beneficial. It would also be beneficial if the probiotic composition(s) could also be used to treat other physiological conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity. 
 Summary of the Invention 
 In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composition comprising at least one of the strains selected from Lactobacillus plantarum 2828 (ECGC 13110403); Lactobacillus plantarum 2830 (ECGC 13110402); and Lactobacillus plantarum 2691 (ECGC 13110401), or mutant strains thereof.

 An initial high throughput screening (HTS) trial of 718 strains of Lactobacilli was conducted to assess the resistance to different types of bile salts. Further experiments were then conducted to investigate bile precipitation in 286 resistant strains in order to establish bile salt hydrolase activity. 
 The strains tested were: Lactobacilli acidophilus, Lactobacilli helveticus, Lactobacilli alimentarius, Lactobacilli brevis, Lactobacilli buchneri, Lactobacilli casei (including subspecies: rhamnosus, casei, tolerans, pseudoplantarum, paracasei, alactotsus and rhamnosus), Lactobacilli crispatus, Lactobacilli curvatus (including subspecies: curvatus), Lactobacilli delbrueckii (including subspecies: bulgaricus and lactis), Lactobacilli fermentum, Lactobacilli panis, Lactobacilli paracasei (including subspecies: paracasei), Lactobacilli pentosus, Lactobacilli planatarum, Lactobacilli plantarum, Lactobacilli rhamnosus, Lactobacilli sakei, Lactobacilli salivarius (including subspecies: salivarius). 
 Strains were grown overnight in MRS at 37°C. Of these cultures glycerol stocks were made and stored at -80 °C. A microtiterplate was inoculated and all strains were placed in quadriplicate into masterplates. 
 WO 2015/067947 
 PCT/GB2014/053301 
 The bile salts used in these experiments were purchased from Sigma® and were as follows: Sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) (Sigma product number G3258, CAS: 16409-34-0); sodium taurodeoxycholate hydrate (TDCA) (Sigma product number T0875, CAS: 207737-97-1) and Bile bovine (Oxgal) (Sigma product number B3883, CAS: 8008-63-7). The concentrations of the bile salts used in the experiments were as follows: 0.5% GDCA; 0.5% TDCA; 0.5% oxgal; and 2.0% oxgal. In vitro data using glycodeoxycholate is believed to be more likely to reflect the likelihood of product efficacy as it more closely mimics the in vivo human environment. 
 Overnight cultures were grown in 96 well plates in MRSA at 37°C. Then 5μΙ of the cultures spotted into wells containing 150μΙ MRSA agar with added bile salts in 96 well plates and incubated for 48 hours under aerobic/anaerobic conditions. pH conditions were monitored so as to ensure proper growth of the strains. 
 The results showed that certain strains do grow on the MRSA plates under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Table 1 below shows all of the positive results from the initial HTS where a particular strain is capable of growing (assessed by measurement of OD 600 ) on a range of bile salts under anaerobic conditions:

 Figure 1 illustrates that many strains grow well in MRSA under aerobic conditions. As shown in Figure 3, GDCA inhibits growth of the strains in all cases under aerobic conditions but as shown in Figure 2 under anaerobic conditions some strains do grow in GDCA. 2.0% Oxgal was found to inhibit the growth of some strains in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

 Table 2 
 A total of 41 strains were found to grow with the presence of all three bile salts present at 0.5%. 
 Bile salt hydrolase activity in resistant strains was then assessed by spotting 5 μΙ into “ 
 PCR tube plate” (150μΙ of agar in a thin walled microcentrifuge tubes). These tube plates were grown under the same conditions as the 96 well plates (MRS + 0.5% TDCA, MRS + 0.5% GDCA, MRS + 0.5% oxgal, MRS + 2.0% oxgal. MRS without bile (control)). 
 WO 2015/067947 
 PCT/GB2014/053301 
 The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C and bile precipitation (related to bile salt hydrolase activity) was assessed after 24 and 48h using the following scoring system: Record growth as + or - for BSH activity. The positives were then selected for subsequent streaking onto MRS plates containg 0.5% oxgal. 
 After 72 hours, a few positives had been identified. The positive cultures only showed precipitation in GDCA and TDCA. 
 Figure 4 shows the range of strains used in the initial high throughput screening assay. 
 After narrowing down the number of strains to 24 based on earler BSH activity, further screening of the cholesterol assimilation in MRS medium supplemented with 0.4% was io conducted. 
 Table 3 below shows the results of the selected strains and their average % cholesterol reduction.

 Table 6 (interesting candidates are underlined) 
 Strains 2828 (ECGC 13110403), 2830 (ECGC 13110402), 2691 (ECGC 13110401) and ATCC43121 show high cholesterol reduction and good BSH activity in both analysis above in tables 5 and 6. The in vitro tests conducted strongly suggest that these strains, whether in combination with one another or individually, would be suitable for use in modifying the absorption of cholesterol or in the treatment of heart disease, diabetes or obesity in an individual. These strains could be used in conjunction with growth specific prebiotics to encourage and support growth. 
 Experiments were then conducted to look at how well a number of strains coped with being freeze dried and also the subsequent BSH activity towards specific bile salts of three selected strains. 
 The first step was to ferment a number of strains. Strains were found to acidify all carriers and cryoprotectants chosen. It was assessed that formulations should be worked cold during production. The choice of carriers and their final concentrations were as follows: 82%MD + 14% Sorbitol (MD = maltodextrin) (rest medium, and bacteria) and 82% MD + 14% Sucrose. 
 All strains grew well on the Nitrogen sources selected with a mix of Yeast extract and Soy 
 WO 2015/067947 
 PCT/GB2014/053301 peptone. No animal ingredients were suggested for the validation, but it was assessed that the soy peptone may cause insoluble precipitate, which could hinder the downstream processing in the future. Ideally, it was assessed that the medium to be used in production is based on 100% YE, with no other Nitrogen sources. Table 7 below shows the summary of the results of the fermentation and viability rates for the three chosen strains (B4321, B2828 and B2830) in the media. In the following data, B4321 relates to the same strain as B2691 referred to earlier.

 Table 7 
 Figure 7 shows the powder counts for a number of strains, whereas Figure 8 shows the 10 freeze drying survival of those same strains. 
 Figure 9 shows the survival of the strains in the stomach. Strain B4321 (B2691) clearly survives better under the conditions tested -109 CFU/mL Stationary cells incubated for 60 min at pH 2.45 in a Na/K/HCI solution with Pepsin adn lipase. 
 Figures 10 and 11 show the Bile Salt Hydrolase activity on the chosen strains. B2828 15 and B2830 converted nearly 100% of the substrate in 3 hrs. Therefore no discrimination appeared to be possible between these strains.

 The forgoing embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the protection afforded by the claims, but rather to describe examples of how the invention may be put into practice. 
 Deposition of Biological Material 
 A deposition of biological material was made for the purposes of a United Kingdom 5 patent application at the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) in the UK. The NCTC is a recognised International Depository Authority (IDA) under the Budapest Treaty. 
 Each of the strains deposited at the NCTC in the UK have been assigned a number with the prefix ECGC. ECGC stands for European Culture General Collection. 
 It should be noted that B2691 (ECGC 13110401) was originally phenotypically classified 10 as a L. reteri upon deposition at the NCTC. It has subsequently been found to be a L. plantarum based upon genetic analysis and this strain is referred to in this application as B2691 and renamed B4321 in later experiments.
