 Seed treatment 
 In the present invention on the other hand, provide the seed by above-mentioned compositions-treated. 
 For a long time, be known and for improveing continuously experimental subjects by the seed that processes plant prevent and treat insect, mite, nematode and/or phytopathogen.But the process of seed relates to a series of problem, it does not always solve in a satisfactory manner.Thus, need exploitation for the protection of the method for seed with the crop emerged, the method is removed from, or is at least obviously reduced between the storage life, at the needs of the extra conveying crop production compositions after planting or after plant emergence.In addition, need the amount optimizing active component used, being seed and the plant that emerges provides most probable protection with the invasion and attack of protection against insect, mite, nematode and/or phytopathogen, but the active component used damage to plant itself.Especially, for using the amount of minimum crop protection composition to reach best seed and emerged plants protected effect, the method for seed treatment also should consider that the genetically modified plants endogenous of anti-insect or resistance to insect kills insect and/or kills nematode character. 
 Therefore, the invention particularly relates to a kind of for the protection of seed and germination plant in order to avoid the method for pest attacks, its for by seed through at least one biocontrol agent defined above and/or the mutant strain of all recognition features with each bacterial strain, and/or to be produced by each bacterial strain show anti-insect, mite, the metabolite of nematode and/or anti-phytopathogen activity, with at least one fungicide (I) of the present invention and optionally at least one fungicide (II) process seed, described fungicide (I) is selected from mitosis and fissional inhibitor and can has the compound of multidigit point effect.The present invention to comprise in the method by seed in one operation simultaneously through at least one biocontrol agent and at least one fungicide (I) from the method for pest attacks for the protection of seed and germination plant, and optionally at least one fungicide (II) process.It also comprises in the method, seed through at least one biocontrol agent and at least one fungicide (I), and optionally at least one fungicide (II) in different time process. 
 The invention still further relates to composition of the present invention for the treatment of seed to protect the plant of seed and formation from the purposes of insect, mite, nematode and/or phytopathogenic invasion. 
 The invention still further relates to seed simultaneously through at least one biocontrol agent and at least one fungicide (I), and optionally at least one fungicide (II) process.The invention still further relates to seed through at least one biocontrol agent and at least one fungicide (I) and optionally at least one fungicide (II) in different time process.When seed through at least one biocontrol agent and at least one fungicide (I) and optionally at least one fungicide (II) is in different time process, each active component in composition of the present invention can be present in the different layers of this seed. 
 In addition, the present invention relates to seed, this seed and---after compositions-treated of the present invention---need through film coating process, thus protect described seed to wear and tear from dust. 
 An advantage of the present invention is; due to the system performance of the uniqueness of the present composition, seed is not only through these compositions-treated plant that seed itself comes from seed (after it is emerged) in addition and provides protection from insect, acarid, nematode and/or phytopathogen invasion and attack.As can be seen here, may there is no need after planting directly to process crop at seeding time or immediately. 
 In fact can see that another advantage is, by through compositions-treated seed of the present invention, the germination of treated seeds can be promoted and emerge. 
 The present composition also can be used to, especially transgenic seed, and this is also considered to favourable. 
 It has been generally acknowledged that, composition of the present invention can be combined with signalling technique reagent (agents of thesignalling technology), consequently, such as, promote the growth with symbiont, such as, enhance rhizobium, mycorhiza (mycorrhiza) and/or endophytic bacterium (endophytic bacteria), and/or nitrogen fixation is optimized. 
 Composition of the present invention is also suitable for the seed of the plant protecting any kind, and it is applied to agricultural, greenhouse, woodland, gardening.More particularly, the seed mentioned is the seed of cereal (as wheat, barley, rye, oat and millet), corn, cotton, soybean, rice, potato, sunflower, coffee bean, tobacco, canola (canola), rape seed (oilseed rape), beet (as beet and fodder beet), peanut, vegetables (such as, tomato, cucumber, Kidney bean, Brassica plants, onion, romaine lettuce), fruit plant, meadow and ornamental plant.The particularly importantly process of the seed of cereal (wheat, barley, rye, oat), corn, soybean, cotton, rape and rice. 
 As mentioned above, transgenic seed is particularly important through compositions-treated of the present invention.Seed generally comprises the plant seed that at least one controls the heterologous gene (heterologous genes) of (especially have desinsection or kill nematode attribute) expression of polypeptides referred in this.These heterologous gene in transgenic seed can from microorganism, such as bacillus, rhizobium, pseudomonas (Pseudomonas), kill thunder Salmonella (Serratia), Trichoderma (Trichoderma), clavibacter belong to (Clavibacter), Paraglomus (Glomus) or Gliocladium (Gliocladium).Composition of the present invention is particularly suitable for processing transgenic seed (comprise at least one heterologous gene) from bacillus.Particularly preferably, the heterologous gene mentioned is from bacillus thuringiensis.

 Following examples illustrate the fabulous bactericidal activity of the bond of the present composition.Although single-activity compound only shows weak Fungicidally active, the drug effect that bond of the present invention shows exceed each compound drug effect simply adding and. 
 When the Fungicidally active of active compound combinations of the present invention exceed reactive compound separately individual application time the summation of activity time always there is the synergistic effect of fungicide.The expection activity of the given combination of described two kinds of reactive compounds can calculate (according to Colby formula) as follows (with reference to S.R.Colby, " Calculation of the synergistic and antagonistic responsesof herbicide combinations ", Weeds (1967), 15,20-22 page): 
 If 
 Drug effect when X is for using reactive compound A with the rate of application of m ppm (or g/ha), 
 Drug effect when Y is for using reactive compound B with the rate of application of n ppm (or g/ha), 
 Expection drug effect when E is for using reactive compound A and B with the rate of application of m and ng/ha (or g/ha), 
 Then

 Drug effect degree is in %.0% means the drug effect being equivalent to control group, and the drug effect of 100% means not observe disease. 
 If actual antifungal drug effect is greater than calculated value, the activity so combined is superadditivity, namely there is synergistic effect.In this case, the antifungal drug effect actually observed necessarily is greater than the expection drug effect value (E) with above-mentioned formulae discovery. 
 Another proves that the method for synergistic effect is Tammes method (reference " Isoboles, a graphicrepresentation of synergism in pesticides " in Neth.J.Plant Path., 1964,70,73-80 page).
