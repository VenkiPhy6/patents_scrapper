 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to plant (Ceratocystis spp.), particularly in sugarcane by strange by long beak shell category in plant
Different Ceratocystis fimbriata Strainses (Ceratocystis paradoxa) biological control of disease caused by (pineapple disease). 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Sugarcane is the grass for having Important Economic meaning.The cultivated area of sugarcane is continuously increased, and its purposes
Nome (Falernum), molasses, Rum, rum are strangled including production sugar, method (the Brazilian soul of a nation) and fuel
Ethanol.The bagasse remained after sugarcane is broken can be not only used for providing the heat energy used in factory, can provide and generally be sold to again
The electric energy of consumer networks, and it is used as the raw material for producing ethanol. 
 Sugarcane belongs to tussock section plant.Sugarcane is by planting whole cane stalk or containing the sweet of one or more buds
The cutting (cutting) of sugarcane stem is bred.These cuttings are sometimes referred to kind of block or plant section (billet).Business cane planting is related to
And manually or mechanically plant whole cane stalk or plant block. 
 Pineapple disease is economically important Sugarcane Disease, and it appears in nearly all country grown cane.The disease is
Caused by the unusual Ceratocystis fimbriata Strainses of fungi, this fungi causes kind of a block to rot after planting.The name of this disease is from kind of a block
Smell produced by putrefaction process, the smell is similar to the smell of mature pineapples. 
 The fungicide of synthesis is typically nonspecific, therefore may act on other lifes in addition to target organism
Thing, including other naturally occurring beneficial organisms.Global consumer increasingly pays close attention to related to chemical residue potential
Environment and health problem, especially in terms of food.This causes the more and more reduction from consumer is chemical (to close
Into) use of agricultural chemicals or at least reduce the pressure of its consumption.Accordingly, it would be desirable to the demand of food chain be controlled, while still can be effective
Ground pest control. 
 Another problem brought using synthesis of antifungal agents is to repeat and individually usual using a kind of fungicide
Cause to select resistant microorganism.Generally, this kind of bacterial strain also there is the active component of the identical mode of action to produce intersection other
Resistance.Then, just it is no longer possible effectively to prevent and treat pathogen using the reactive compound.However, with new effect
The research and development of the active component of mechanism are both difficult and expensive. 
 The risk of the resistance development of pathogen colony and concern to environment and human health are promoted to be used in identification
Control the interest in terms of the substitute of plant insect and the synthesis of antifungal agents of disease. 
 The use of biocontrol agent (BCA) is a kind of alternative solution.In some cases, most of BCA effect not yet reaches
To with traditional fungicide identical level, particularly in the case of severe infections pressure.Therefore, in some cases, it is raw
Thing control agent, its mutant and the metabolin being generated by it, particularly in the case of low rate of application, can not make us full completely
Meaning. 
 Therefore, lasting to need to develop plant protection product that is new, substituting, it at least contributes to meet above-mentioned in some fields
Demand.In particular, it is desirable to which more effective way prevents and treats the pineapple disease of sugarcane.

 The composition and bacterial strain of the present invention are applied to or handled plant propagation material, the method for particularly seed is ability
Known to domain, and including the method applied is coated, coats, granulated and soaked to propagating materials. 
 In some embodiments, application process part of the invention is used to protect plant propagation material invading from insect
Evil, according to the present invention, the plant propagation material is that can develop into complete plant after planting or being seeded into plantation or sowing site
Any vegetable material of thing, such as seedling, rhizome, nursery plants, particularly cutting or seed, such as fruit, stem tuber, grain or
Bulb, the application process is characterised by, for example, suitable composition is applied in this way, i.e., it is spatially close
Close to the propagating materials plant or be seeded in plantation or sowing site mode, or spatially with the propagating materials plant
Or it is seeded in the mode of plantation or sowing site together.According to the present invention, spatially to be planted close to the propagating materials
Or be seeded in the mode in plantation or sowing site and apply before these compositions preferably take place plantation or seed propagation material, it is logical
Cross soil application composition directly is applied into propagating materials plantation or sowing site and carried out, for example, preferably take place sowing extremely
Before in seed furrow or the region limited around the site of plantation or seed propagation material.Spatially can be with propagating materials
Plant or be applied to the administration of this composition that the site of plantation or sowing carries out together is understood to mean that can be according to expection
The propagating materials pre-processed using these compositions is planted or sowed in the site planted or sowed by purpose and current environment,
For the propagating materials pretreatment for example by by composition sprayed, spraying, dusting or be sown on propagating materials or will
Composition brush or be poured on propagating materials, or carried out in the case of seed also especially by seed dressing.Work as progress
, will before seed is sowed in dressing equipment during seed dressing (that is, doing kind, wet-mixing kind, liquid seed dressing or slurries seed dressing)
Bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumilus and/or its metabolin are added to seed and for example by by the content in dressing equipment
Thing is stirred and/or composition is distributed evenly on seed by rotating and/or vibrating whole dressing equipment.It is this
The special embodiment of Dressing includes, for example, seed is immersed in fluid composition, be coated with using solid composite
Seed (seed pelleting) or by adding composition in the water for pre-soaking seed and realizing makes active component penetrate into seed
(seed soaking). 
 Conventional treatment technology and machine (such as fluidization, roller press method, rotation static seed processing can be used
Device and drum-type seed-coating machine) composition and bacterial strain of the present invention are applied to seed.Other methods such as spouted bed can also be used.
Size can be pre-selected in seed before coating.After coating, generally by seed drying and diameter sizer (sizing is subsequently transferred to
Machine) to select size.This selection size and the method handled are as known in the art. 
 In one embodiment, plant can be applied to by not triggering the method for rudiment by the composition and bacterial strain of the present invention
Thing propagating materials is handled propagating materials๏ผGenerally immersion seed can cause rudiment, because the water content mistake of gained seed
It is high.Therefore, it is that seed dressing, seed pelleting or seed are made using the example of the appropriate method of (or processing) plant propagation material such as seed
Grain etc.. 
 In a typical embodiment, the plant propagation material is seed.Although this method is believed to apply
For the seed of any physiological status, but preferred seed is in the state that can be resistant to enough, so that in processing procedure not
Cause damage.Generally, seed can be that harvest is separated from field, from plant and any cob, stem, shell and surrounding
Pulp or the seed of other non-seed vegetable material separation.What seed preferably can also biologically be stablized so that processing is not
Biological damage can be caused to seed.Thinking can be between seed harvest and seed sowing or any during seeding process
Time-triggered protocol seed (administration for being directed to seed).The technology that can also be known according to those skilled in the art before treatment or it
