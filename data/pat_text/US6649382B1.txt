 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to polyhydroxyalkanoate (hereinafter referred to as “PHA”) biosynthesis-related genes for PHA synthase, β-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, derived from  Alcaligenes latus , their amino acid sequences, a recombinant plasmid carrying these genes, and a method for mass producing PHA using these genes. 
 2. Description of the Prior Art 
 Petroleum synthetic plastics are so durable that they are not degraded in usual conditions at all. Because the production amount of the petroleum synthetic plastics increases each year, the environmental pollution ascribed to petroleum synthetic plastics wastes are now a big social problem. To solve the problem of non-degradable plastics, active research and development efforts have been and continued to be directed to biodegradable polymers all over the world. 
 Biodegradable polymers are the high molecular weight materials that are completely degraded under natural conditions after a period of time. Many biodegradable polymers have been developed. Of them, PHA, a natural polyester which is synthesized and accumulated by microorganisms, is of particular interest because it is superior in biodegradability as well as shows physical properties similar to those of the synthetic plastics in current use (Anderson A. J. and Dawes, E. A.,  Microbiol. Rev ., 1990, 54, 450-472; Lee, S. Y.,  Biotechnol. Bioeng ., 49:1-14,1996; Lee, S. Y.,  Trends Biotechnol ., 14:431 -438, 1996). 
 In detail, PHA is an organic reserve material, which can provide an intracellular store of carbon or energy, usually found in Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Azotobacter, and Bacillus spp.,etc. It is detectable as granular cytoplasmic inclusions. As a general rule, the cellular content of the reserve material is relatively low in actively growing cells: They accumulate massively when cells are limited in nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, oxygen, etc., but still have carbon and energy available. This reserve material was first found in  Bacillus megaterium  by Lemoigne in 1925 (Lemoigne, M.,  Bull. Soc. Chem. Biol ., 8:770-782, 1926). Since then, its chemical and physical properties have been extensively researched. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is the most widely, and first known PHA. 
 According to the number of carbon atoms and the substituents in hydroxyalkanoate, many PHAs were reported. In general, PHAs are divided into two classes; short-chain-length PHAs(SCL PHAs) and medium-chain-length PHAs(MCL PHAs) 
 SCL PHAs include poly-β-hydroxypropionic acid, poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid, and poly-β-hydroxyvaleric acid, which are produced by  Alcaligenes eutrophus, Azotobacter vinelandii, methylotrophs , etc. SCL PHAs are widely used due to their similar properties to polypropylene, a kind of chemically synthesized plastics. 
 MCL PHAs, composed of 3 to 9 more carbon atoms than SCL PHAs, are produced by Pseudomonas spp., by using alkane, 1-alkene, C 6 ˜C 12  alkanoic acids as a carbon. 
 Since early the 1960s, it was recognized that PHA could work like thermoplastic polymers. Thereafter, attracting a great attention, many types of PHA copolymers were synthesized, which are superior in mechanical properties as well as in biodegradability. By virtue of these advantages and owing to the environmental pollution aggravated by petroleum synthetic polymer wastes, PHA is now actively researched and developed as an alternative for plastics over the world. In addition, biocompatibility and bioabsorptivity allow PHA to be used in a variety of fields, as materials for agriculture, medicinal care, drug transfer system, and package, and as precursors for fine chemical products (Holmes, P. A. in Developments in crystalline polymers. 1-65, 1988). 
 Taking advantage of various bacteria, molecular biological research has revealed that there are four different biosynthetic pathway for PHA (Steinbuchel, A. in Biomaterials: novel materials from biological sources, 215-262, 1991). For example, for  Alcaligenes eutrophus , the most widely known bacteria, β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (PHA synthase) are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of PHA (People, O. P. and Shinskey, A. J.,  J. Biol Chem ., 264: 15298-15303, 1989; Schubert, P., Steinbuchel, A. and Schlegel, H. G.,  J. Bacteriol ., 170:5837-5847, 1988; Slater, S. C., Voige, W. H. and Dennis, D. E.,  J. Bacteriol ., 170:4431-4436, 1988). 
 A concrete biosynthetic pathway of PHA in  Alcaligenes eutrophus , gram negative bacteria, is as follows. Between two molecules of acetyl-CoA, a carbon-carbon bond forms in the presence of β-ketothiolase, the product of gene phbA , according to a biological Claisen condensation. The acetoacetyl-CoA thus formed is converted into D(−)-β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by the stereoselective reduction of NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, the product of gene phbB. Finally, D(−)-β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is polymerized via ester bond by PHA synthase, the product of gene phbC. 
 In order to clone the genes which pertain to the biosynthesis of PHA in other bacteria than  Alcaligenes eutrophus , much effort has been made. That is, the comprehension of the biosynthesis of PHA in bacteria makes it possible efficient production of PHA, versatility of substrates, synthesis of new PHA, and development of biopolymers similar to PHA. Further, recombinant strains which are obtained by utilizing the PHA biosynthesis-related genes can synthesize various PHAs at high efficiencies, resulting in a scientific and industrial significance (Lee, S. Y.,  Trends Biotechnol ., 14:431-438, 1996). 
 Strain  Alcaligenes latus  is reported to be so superior in the production of PHA that it accumulates PHA in cells at a proportion of around 90%. Also,  Alcaligenes latus  as the advantage in that it grows fast and uses inexpensive substrates as carbon sources (Wang, F. and Lee, S. Y.,  Appl. Environ. Microbiol ., 63:3703-3706, 1997). Unlike  Alcaligenes eutrophus, Alcaligenes latus  accumulates PHAs while they are growing. Thus,  Alcaligenes latus  can mass-produce PHA by one-step culture although the amount is low relative to that upon  Alcaligenes eutrophus.    
 The use of  Alcaligenes latus  to produce PHA began in earnest in the mid-1980s by Chemie Linz AG, Austria. Biotechnologishe forchungesellschaft mbH, Austria, developed a process in which a one-step culture of strain btF-96, a mutant strain of  Alcaligenes latus ., produces PHA, asserting that one ton of PHA is obtained from a 15 m 3  ferinentor per week (Hrabak, O., FEMS  Microbial. Rev ., 103:251-256, 1992).  Alcaligenes latus  also produces poly(3-hydroxybutyrate/3-hydroxypropionate) as well as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate/4-hydroxypropionate) in a medium containing disaccharides as carbon source by addition of 3-hydroxypropionate and γ-butyrolactone (Hiramitsu, M., Koyama, N., and Doi, Y.,  Biotechnol. Leit ., 15:461-464, 1993). 
 PHA can be produced by chemical process as well as biological process. However, Commercially favorable production scale of PHA is possible only by biological process. Since the production cost of PHA is much higher than those of other commercially available synthetic polymers, new technologies are required to reduce the production cost of PHA. Particularly, recombinant DNA technology gives a great contribution to the development and modification of novel strains, showing the production of novel polymers, utility of low-priced substrate, high efficiency of production, and facility in separation and purification. In order to develop such recombinant strains, first of all, it is necessary to understand the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway for PHA. 
 In order to mass-produce biodegradable, natural PHA and its copolymers, the inventors have cloned genes for polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, β-ketothiolase, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase, and determined amino acid sequences and gene sequences. They have made expression vectors carrying the above genes and transformants, whereby polyhydroxyalkanoate can be produced and accumulated.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention provides polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis-related genes. 
 The present invention provides an expression vector containing the polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis-related genes and their transformant. 
 The present invention further provides methods for preparing polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase enzyme. Further still, the invention further provide methods for producing PHAs, including polyhybroxybutyrates, and preferably poly(3-hydroxybutyrate, using vectors and host cells described herein. 
 In the present invention, genes for the biosynthesis of PHA, are separated from  Alcaligenes latus , which accumulates PHA while growing, whereby biodegradable, natural and industrially useful PHA and its copolymers can be mass-produced. 
 In more detail, the total genomic DNA separated from  Alcaligenes latus  is partly digested by restriction enzymes and the resulting DNA fragments are inserted into vector pUC19 . E. coli  is transformed with vector pUC19, followed by the selection of the recombinant vectors with a PHA biosynthesis-related DNA. The bacteria harboring the interest DNA was observed to accumulate PHA on a solid medium and in a liquid medium, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively. 
 Isolation of the recombinant vector from the transformed bacteria capable of producing PHA is the first step in a process of identifying the DNA fragment of interest. Various analytic works show that the DNA fragment of interest is 6.4 kb in size, containing the genes coding for all of the β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and PHA synthase. 
 Therefore, in accordance with one aspect, the present invention pertains to a PHA biosynthesis-related DNA fragment containing a PHA synthase gene, a β-ketothiolase gene and an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase gene, in due order, which has a size of 1608 bp (corresponding to 536 aa), 1176 bp (392 aa) and 735 bp (245 aa), respectively. 
 Sequencing analyses reveal that the PHA synthase gene (phbC) has a base sequence of Sequence 2 with a corresponding amino acid sequence of  Sequence  5, as suggested in the accompanying Sequence Lists. The β-ketothiolase gene (phbA) has a base sequence of Sequence 3 and the β-ketothiolase expressed therefrom has an amino acid sequence of  Sequence  6. The analyses also give that the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase gene (phbB) has a base sequence of Sequence 4 which corresponds to an amino acid sequence of Sequence 7(see, FIG.  3  and Sequence Listing). 
 The recombinant vector anchoring the DNA for biosynthesis of PHA was named pJC1 (see, FIG. 4) and the transformant,  E. coli  XL-1 Blue/pJC1, was deposited in Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korean Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology on Nov. 5, 1997 and received a Deposition No. KCTC 0398 BP. 
 In accordance with another aspect, the present invention pertains to the preparation of the PHA biosynthesis-related enzymes by culturing host bacteria which harbor a recombinant expression vector containing the PHA biosynthesis-related genes. 
 In accordance with a further aspect, the present invention pertains to the production of PHA and its copolymers by use of the above host bacteria which can express the PHA biosynthesis-related genes. To this end,  E. coli  was transformed by the recombinant expression vector and after selecting, the transformed  E. coli  was cultured in a liquid medium containing glucose in suitable concentration to produce PHA. Where the  E. coli  was cultured in this manner, PHA was observed to accumulate until it represent as much as 40% or more of the dry cell weight. 
 In an alternative aspect of the invention, the total genomic DNA separated from  Alcaligenes latus  is partly digested by restriction enzyme, followed by selecting the DNA fragment showing a positive signal by use of a PHA gene derived from  Alcaligenes eutrophus  H16 as a probe. Plasmid vector pAL32 is obtained by inserting the above PHA gene into pSK(+). 
 The pAL32 is digested with EcoRI and NotI to obtain the PHA gene. The resulting gene is then inserted into plasmid pK230, that has a broad host range, to obtain the recombinant expression vector pKTC32. This pKTC32 can express the gene in various host cells. This is illustrated by FIG.  5 . 
 The transformant  Alcaligenes eutrophus  LAR5 was obtained by inserting pKTC32 into  Alcaligenes eutrophus  DSM541 which is lacking a PHA gene. This vector was deposited under the terms of the Budapest Treaty in the Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korean Research institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology on Jan. 18, 1999, with the deposit No. KCTC 0568 BP. 
 When the above transformant  Alcaligenes eutrophus  DSM541 (phb − )/pKTC32 is cultured, it is observed that PHA synthase is produced in the cell cytoplasm in the form of white particles. 
 The invention will now be illustrated by the following examples, but not be limited in scope by reason of any of the following examples. 
 EXAMPLE I 
 Separation of Genomic DNA from  Alcaligenes latus    
 The strain  Alcaligenes latus  (Wang, F and Lee. S. Y.,  Appl. Envirn. Microbiol ., 63:3707-3706, 1997) was cultured overnight in 500 ml of an NB medium (8 g/L nutrient broth). The bacteria in an initial stage of exponential growth were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with saline-EDTA (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0). The washed bacteria were suspended in 40 ml of 0.1 M salinc-Tris-Cl (0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 9.0) and 1 ml of lysozyme solution (20 mg/ml) prepared just before use was added to the suspension. This suspension was dropwise added at 37° C. with Tris-SDS buffer (0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, added with 5% SDS) with slow agitation. When the resulting solution became viscous, 5.5 ml of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added and the total solution was incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours to remove proteins. Next, equal volume of phenol was added to the solution and well mixed for 30 min at room temperature with caution. After the solution was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh beaker followed by volume-measurement, and slowly added with two times the volume of cold ethanol to precipitate the genomic DNA which was, then, rolled up with a glass bar. The DNA was dried at room temperature and dissolved in 10 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Thereafter RNase was added to the above solution until the final concentration became 50 μg/ml and the total solution was incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. Then the same following process, i.e. mixing with phenol, centrifugation, volume mearsurement, addition of cold ethanol, rolling up, drying, and resuspension in TE buffer, was repeated. The only difference was that the concentration of TE buffer was 2 ml. 
 EXAMPLE II 
 Cloning of PHA Biosynthesis-Related Genes 
 The genomic DNA of  Alcaligenes latus , obtained Example I, was partly digested by restriction enzyme Sau3AI. Because restriction enzyme Sau3AI recognizes a specific four-base sequence in double-stranded DNA and cleaves both strands of the duplex at a specific site, various DNA fragments ranging from a small size to a large size can be obtained. These DNA fragments were separated according to size by electrophoresis on a low-melting temperature agarose gel. 
 To obtain the whole PHA biosynthesis-related gene, only the genes which were as large as or larger than 4 kb in size, were selected and inserted in plasmid pUC19 2.68 kb in size. To this end, first, the plasmid was cut with restriction enzyme BamHI which leaves the same end sequence with restriction enzyme Sau3AI. Then, the genomic DNA fragments at least 4 kb long were ligated with the opened plasmid vector pUC19 by using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). 
 The recombinant vector thus obtained was used to transform  E. coli  XL1-Blue (Stratagene) with the aid of an electroporator. When the recombinant vector pUC19 which contained the whole PHA biosynthesis-related gene at a BamHI cloning site was taken up by  E. coli  XL1-Blue, white colonies were formed on a solid LB medium (tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L, NaCl 10 g/L) supplemented with ampicillin, X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) and IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside). On the other hand, where the bacteria contained plasmid vector pUC19 without a DNA insert, blue colonies were formed. Through this procedure, colonies containing plasmid vector pUC19 with a partial genomic DNA insert of  Alcaligenes latus , were selected. In order to determine whether these colonies were able to produce PHA, they each were inoculated in a broth capable of accumulating PHA. 
 As a result, recombinant  E. coli  were obtained that were able to accumulate PHA. Analysis of the recombinant plasmid vector that was separated from the recombinant  E. coli  confirmed that Vector pUC19 anchored a partial genomic DNA of  Alcaligenes latus , 6.4 kb long, and that this DNA fragment contained the PHA synthesis-related genes. In addition, base sequencing analysis revealed that the 6.4 kb DNA fragment coded for all of the PHA biosynthesis-related enzymes, that is, β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and PHA synthase. 
 In the present invention, the recombinant expression vector was named pJC1. The transformant which harbored plasmid pJC1 was deposited in Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korean Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology on Nov. 5, 1997, as Deposit No. KCTC 0398BP. 
 EXAMPLE III 
 Structure Analysis of PHA Genes Derived from  A. latus    
 The 6.4 kb DNA insert ligated to the plasmid vector pUC19 was analyzed, and the analysis confirmed that the vector contained all of the genes for β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and PHA synthase. These genes were located in the following order (5′ to 3′): PHA synthase, β-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. 
 Regarding the sizes of the PHA biosynthesis genes, the PHA synthase gene, β-ketothiolase gene and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase gene were 1608 bp (536 aa), 1176 bp (392 aa) and 735 bp (245 aa) long, respectively. 
 EXAMPLE IV 
 PHA-Producing Recombinant  E. coli  Containing PHA Biosynthesis-Related Genes Derived from  A. latus    
 The recombinant expression vector pJC1 anchoring the 6.4 kb genomic DNA fragment of  Alcaligenes latus  was used to transform  E. coli  XL1-Blue. Since the bacteria which took up the recombinant expression vector could grow in a medium containing ampicillin, selection of the  E. coli  transformants was made on a solid medium containing 100 g/ml ampicillin. The selected  E. coli  was cultured in a defined or complex liquid medium containing 20 g/l glucose to produce PHA. When the strain was cultured at a temperature of 30 or 37° C. in a flask, PHA was accumulated until it represented as much as 40% or more of the dry cell weight. 
 As described hereinbefore, the PHA biosynthesis-related genes of the present invention are derived from  Alcaligenes latus  and contains all of the genes for PHA synthase, β-ketothiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. When  E. coli  is transformed with the PHA biosynthesis-related genes of the present invention, a one-step culture of the transformant  E. coli  can mass-produce PHA. In addition, these enzymes and the genes are very helpful in understanding the biosynthesis of PHA in a molecular biological level. 
 The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation. 
 Many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore, it is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. 
 EXAMPLE V 
 Separation of the PHA Synthase Gene from  Alcaligenes latus  and Determination of its DNA and Amino Acid Sequence 
 In order to separate out the PHA synthase gene, total DNA was extracted from culture of  Alcaligenes latus  and digested with restriction enzymes such as BamHI, HindIII, SmaI, XhoI, and SalI and the DNA fragment was obtained. 
 The 3.2 kb DNA fragment showing a positive signal was separated from the fragments resulting from the BamHI digestion by using the 1 kb PHA synthase gene that was derived from  Alcaligenes eutrophus  as a probe. 
 Then the separated DNA was ligated to the BamHI restriction site of the vector pSK(+), whereby recombinant plasmid pAL32 was constructed. (see FIG. 4) 
 As the result of analyzing the pAL32 DNA sequence, by the Sanger Method (dideoxy-nucleotide chain termination method), it was revealed that the PHA synthase gene derived from  Alcaligenes latus  consists of 1,608 bp. The amino acid sequence of the PHA synthase encoded by the above PHA synthase gene, was analyzed by using PC/Gene software program. PHA synthase derived from  Alcaligenes latus  has the amino acid sequence composed by 536 amino acids. 
 EXAMPLE VI 
 Construction of Recombinant Expression vector pKTC32 Containing the PHA Synthase Gene 
 The PHA synthase gene is obtained by digesting pAL32 with EcoRI and NotI, and then the resulting DNA fragment was ligated to the restriction site by EcoRI and NotI. (see FIG. 4) 
 EXAMPLE VII 
 Preparation of PHA-producing Recombinant  Alcaligenes eutrophus  LAR5 
 The recombinant expression vector pKTC32 of Example VI was introduced into the strains of  A. eutrophus  DSM541 which is lacking in PHA synthase gene. When culturing the transformant, PHB particles in the cell were observed. 
 EXAMPLE VIII 
 Identification of Primer Region of a PHA Gene Derived From  A. latus    
 For the purpose of identifying the PHA gene primer region, the total DNA of  Alcaligenes latus  was separated. The location of the starting site for RNA transcription was determined by the primer extension method, and then the promoter region consisting of 210 bp DNA upstream was obtained. The gene sequence of promoter region of PHA was analyzed by the PC/Gene software program.
