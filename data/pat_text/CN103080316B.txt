Accumulation in oily level part of thing host, but this list is understood not to restrictive or completely. 
 Term " oily " refers to the lipid matter at 25 DEG C for liquid；Described oil is hydrophobic, but dissolves in organic molten
In agent.In the biology of oil-containing, oil constitutes the major part of TL." oily " is mainly made up of triacylglycerol [" TAG "],
But also can comprise other neutral lipid, phosphatide and free fatty.Aliphatic acid composition in oil and the aliphatic acid group of TL
Compound is similar in general.Therefore, the PUFA that the raising of the PUFA concentration in TL or reduction would correspond in oil is dense
The raising of degree or reduction, vice versa. 
 " neutral lipid " refers to those lipids being generally present in the liposome in cell with depot lipid form, they
So name is because under cellular pH, and described lipid is without charged group.They are usually the most nonpolar, to water without parent
And power.Neutral lipid refers generally to the monoglyceride of aliphatic acid, diester and/or three esters, also referred to as monoacylglycerol
[" MAG "], DG [" DAG "] or triacylglycerol, or it is referred to as acylglycerol.For release trip from acylglycerol
From aliphatic acid, it is necessary to hydrolysis occurs. 
 Term " triacylglycerol " [" TAG "] refers to the neutral fats being made up of three fatty acyl residues of acylated glycerol molecule
Matter.TAG can comprise long-chain PUFA and saturated fatty acid, and the saturated and undersaturated aliphatic acid that chain is shorter. 
 Term " TFA " [" TFA "] refers herein to the total amount of all cells aliphatic acid, and described aliphatic acid is to usual practice
Can be by alkali ester exchange method (methods known in the art) derived chemical conversion fatty acid methyl ester [" FAME "] in son, such as it can
To be living beings or oil.Therefore, TFA includes from neutral fats quality and grade part (including DAG, MAG and TAG) with from polarity
The aliphatic acid of lipid level part (including such as phosphatid ylcholine [" PC "] and phosphoric acid acyl monoethanolamine [" PE "] level part), but not including that
Free fatty. 
 " total lipid content " of term cell is measuring of TFA, although it is with the percentage of dry cell wt [" DCW "]
Form represents, but total lipid content can account for the percentage [" FAME%DCW "] of DCW with FAME approx measures.Therefore, total fat
Matter content [" TFA%DCW "] is equal to the TFA milligram number of the most every 100 milligrams of DCW. 
 Fatty acid concentration in TL is denoted herein as the percentage by weight [" %TFA "] of TFA, the most every 100 milligrams
The given aliphatic acid milligram number of TFA.Unless specifically stated otherwise in disclosure, given aliphatic acid is relative to TL
Percentage be equal to the fatty acid concentration (%EPA of such as TL is equal to EPA%TFA) based on %TFA. 
 In some cases, the content of aliphatic acid given in cell is expressed as it and accounts for weight the % [" % of dry cell wt

Property be probably critical, and therefore and get rid of as sudden change target spot.Some site only group I, II, III and IV in one
It is conservative (i.e., not absolute conservation) in a little sequences.These sites it is believed that for the extension enzyme in group I, II, III and IV
The substrate specificity shown is probably important.Some site is relatively conservative in group III (to be comprised known to whole 4 kinds
Δ 9 extends enzyme), but also show difference；See amino acid sites 22,47,54,101,107,111,115,161,182,192
Numbering based on EgD9eS with 242().These sites it is believed that extending the activity of enzyme for Δ 9 is likely to be important, and
Speculate that it regulates and controls Ea_d9e(SEQ ID NO:12), Eg_d9e(SEQ ID NO:8), E398_d9e(SEQ ID NO:4) and Ig_
D9e(SEQ ID NO:2) difference on substrate specificity. 
 Analysis to cross-film [" the TM "] domain in EgD9eS uses TMHMM program to carry out (" Prediction of
transmembrane helices in proteins”；TMHMM Server v.2.0, Center for Biological
Sequence Analysis, BioCentrum-DTU, Technical University of Denmark, DK-
2800Lyngby, Denmark).6 transbilayer helixs of described predictive display (corresponding to amino acid residue 32-51,66-88,
114-136,156-175,188-206,221-243), N and C end is respectively positioned on cytoplasm side.When using described TMHMM program pair
When Ot_elo2, Ig_elo1, Pav_elo2 and Tp_elo2 carry out similar analysis, the quantity of transbilayer helix is from 4 to 8.Cause
This, employ the function information with lower part for these different predictions unified. 
 1. rich histidine motif [Q/H] xxHH(" His-box " of high conservative) according to showing for Ig_d9e(SEQ ID
NO:2) optimal enzymatic activity is critical, but its be not directly responsible for substrate specificity (Qi et al., FEBS Letters,
547:137-139(2003)).Therefore this His-box(of its strong indication is corresponding to the amino acid residue 134-138 in EgD9eS)
Participate in avtive spot；And its should be positioned among the cytoplasm side of this folded protein or near so that substrate is entered
Enter described avtive spot. 
 The C end of 2.EgD9eS exists the site of multiple high conservatives of tool charged residues.They likely with activity
It is correlated with and therefore C end can be located at the cytoplasm side of this folded protein. 
 And the result of TMHMM (will be predicted as cross-film spiral shell between amino acid residue 114-136 and amino acid residue 156-175
Rotation) contrast, the sequence area between above-mentioned imagination display residue 114-136 is not across cell membrane, this is because this His-box
Not can be located at the outside of cell membrane.TM structure if C end is positioned cytoplasm side, then between the 156-175 predicted
The most non-leap in territory cell membrane.Because the substrate extending enzyme is very hydrophobic, therefore it should have possibly in double-layer of lipoid.Institute
State avtive spot (including this His-box) be likely to be present in or be in close proximity to surface of cell membrane. 
 Therefore, it is predicted that the two hydrophobic region is (that is, corresponding to amino acid residue 114-136 and amino acid residue 156-
175) it is located near or in inner membrane leaflets to guarantee that this avtive spot described is close to cell membrane.For EgD9eS predicted final
Film topological model illustrates in Figure 4 A.Specifically, each vertical cylindrical body represents transmembrane segment, and each Horizontal Cylinder represents
Hydrophobic stretching area at or approximately at inner membrane leaflets.The conservative glutamine [Q] being in this His-box and histidine [H]
(that is, corresponding to amino acid residue 134-138) marks with small circle.Finally, " interior " corresponds to cytoplasmic space, and " outward " is corresponding
In film periplasmic space. 
 Although conservative mode analysis extends enzyme (that is, Ea_d9e [SEQ ID NO:12], Eg_d9e [SEQ at group III Δ 9
ID NO:8], E398_d9e [SEQ ID NO:4] and Ig_d9e [SEQ ID NO:2]) identified and it is predicted and affect enzymatic activity
In 11 kinds of different aminoacids residues, but from prediction topological model result further limit Candidate Residues.Specifically
Ground, according to inferring site vital for enzymatic activity must be positioned at the cytoplasm side residing for avtive spot or its near.Amino
Acid residue 47,54 and 192 fails to meet this standard and it is therefore assumed that the activity that they extend enzyme for regulation and control Δ 9 does not weigh
Want. 
 According to above-mentioned logicality, it is possible to interfere significantly on the Candidate Residues of Δ 9 elongase activity of EgD9eS from SEQ
258 residues in the full-length proteins of ID NO:10 are down to only 8 residues, its corresponding to the 22nd, 101,107,111,115,
161,182 and 242.The substrate conversion efficiency for improving EgD9eS is recommended as direct mutagenesis target in these 8 sites.Reality hereafter

 The logicality that 50 kinds of different residues in targeting EgD9eS are assessed for offunctional site 
 
 Having identified Δ 9 extend enzyme and it is carried out function sign, it is from IsochrysisgalbauaParke [" IgD9e "] (SEQ
ID NO:2；PCT Publication WO2002/077213, WO2005/083093, WO2005/012316 and WO2004/057001；
GenBank accession number AAL37626), small-sized green alga belong to CCMP389 [" E389D9e "] (SEQ ID NO:4；United States Patent (USP) 7,
645,604), euglena gracilis [" EgD9e "] (SEQ ID NO:8；United States Patent (USP) 7,645,604) and E.anabaena [" EaD9e "]
(SEQ ID NO:12；United States Patent (USP) 7,794,701).The most all LA can be changed into EDA according to these extension enzymes of display.
EgD9e, EaD9e and E389D9e have the sequence similarity higher than 60% each other, and IgD9E Yu EgD9e, EaD9e and
Any one in E389D9e only has the sequence similarity (based on ClustalW(version 1.83) of about 35% and analyzes, and uses
Default parameters (that is, protein weight matrix=Gonnet250, gap opening penalty=10, gap
Extension penalty=0.2 and completely alignment algorithm). 
 Cause having (such as, the D98G [example 4] and L35G improving the mutant that Δ 9 extends enzymatic conversion efficiency according to observation
[example 6]) there is moderate sequence conservation.Set up the amino acid alignment of IgD9e, EgD9e, EaD9e and E389D9e with mirror
The residue that other moderate fixed is conservative, it uses The default parameters of AlignX program carry out
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) (Fig. 1).According to supposing that the residue that these moderates are guarded is probably work
For the good candidate of 49-Phe ,82-Ser,115-Arg,144-Met,145-Asn ,161-Arg,169-Met Human Connective tissue growth factor, it has improvement activity for producing the most described not mutated EgD9eS comparison potentially
Second generation mutant enzyme. 
 By comparing the sequence of these four homology enzyme, 58 in 258 amino acid positions prolong at whole four kinds after measured
Stretching in enzyme conservative, therefore these residues are not considered.Additionally, 92 positions are after measured between EgD9e, EaD9e and E389D9e
It is conservative；These positions are not considered yet.Finally, due to have the position normal condition of random amino acid between homologue
Under in protein function, do not play remarkable effect, extend at whole four kinds after measured, between enzymes, there are four kinds of different aminoacids
Other 22 positions of the residue target location therefore and not as functional assessment considers.
