 The present invention relates to N-Thio-anthranilamid compounds and the novelty teabag of mixture in soil and seed treatment application process with other selected agricultural chemicals thereof. 
 Invertebrate nuisance, arthropods and nematode, especially insect and arachnid (arachnid) are destroyed the crop of Growth and yield and attack wooden house and pattern of trade, cause the tremendous economic of food supply and property to be lost thus.Although known a large amount of agricultural chemicals reagent, but described reagent produced to the ability of resistance due to objective pests, continue to need to resist the pharmaceutical preparations of invertebrate nuisance as insect, arachnid and nematode. 
 Usually by the suitable agricultural chemical compound to soil application effective dose, such as by immersion liquid perfusion, drip and execute, soak and to execute or soil injects and control and resist especially soil raw nuisance, arthropods nuisance, comprise soil-borne insects and arachnid, especially spider mite and nematode.Agricultural chemical compound can be further used as solid or fluid composition is used, such as, comprise inert carrier as the pulvis of clay or granular formulation. 
 May some problem be there is in soil application method.Agricultural chemical compound is not always particularly suited for by different soils application process, such as by immersion liquid perfusion, drip execute, soak execute or soil inject use.In some cases, their pesticide activity may be affected. 
 Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide to a large amount of different invertebrate nuisance in soil treatment technology, especially the raw nuisance of the soil being difficult to prevent and treat is had to the compound of good pesticide activity and good applicability. 
 The composition pesticide of some soil applications also may have leaching potential quality.Therefore, must carefully surface water and groundwater pollution be down to minimum.In addition, depend on environmental condition, the effect of agricultural chemicals may change, and such as, in order to make chemicals successfully play a role in soil, need suitable timing rainfall, but excessive rainfall may reduce effect and may cause leaching. 
 Therefore, object of the present invention is also suitable for resisting the raw nuisance of soil and the composition overcoming the problem relevant with known technology for providing.Especially, described composition easily should be used and provide the long-acting to the raw nuisance of soil.In addition, environmental condition should not have adverse effect to the effect of described agricultural chemicals. 
 Therefore, object of the present invention is also for providing the application process being suitable for resisting the raw nuisance of soil. 
 Soil application method is regarded as different technologies agricultural chemical compound being directly or indirectly applied to soil and/or ground, such as, drip to execute or drip irrigation (on soil) or soil inject, the additive method of immersion liquid perfusion soil. 
 In addition, object of the present invention is for by dipping root, stem tuber or bulb (being called that leaching is executed), plant system or the application process also implemented by seed treatment via water. 
 Thus, the other problems that farmer faces is the constant threat that the root of seed and plant and tender shoots are subject to blade face and soil insect and other nuisances. 
 Therefore, with use such seed another difficulty of protecting agricultural chemicals relevant to be repeatedly and only use the quick selection that single agricultural chemical compound now also can cause having produced the nature of described reactive compound or the soil nuisance of adaptability resistance in many cases.Therefore the seed protectant helping prevent or overcome resistance is needed. 
 Therefore, another object of the present invention be to provide can solve seed and growing plant protection, depressant dose rate, increase the compound of the protection problem of activity profile and/or management and control pest resistance. 
 Therefore, present invention also offers protective plant propagating materials, especially seed is in case the root of plant of soil insect and protection gained and spray are in case the method for soil and foliar insect. 
 The invention still further relates to protected in case the plant propagation material of soil and foliar insect, especially seed. 
 Surprisingly, have now found that anthranilamides or its stereoisomer, salt, dynamic isomer or the N-oxide of formula (I), or the polymorphic of compound or its stereoisomer, salt, dynamic isomer or N-oxide, eutectic or solvate:

 (bromine cyanogen insect amide (Cyantraniliprole) and chlorantraniliprole are to the desolate activity of maize seed for test the compounds of this invention and other diamide compounds.Described compound is dissolved in acetone, then adds water to obtain the ultimate density of 0.5% acetone.Ratio is 1ppm and 10ppm.Four cucumber seeds (Cucumis sativus, " National Pickling ") are placed in and sprout bag, add 18mL solution.Bag is kept upright at couveuse (22 DEG C, 14L:10D).After treatment 2 days (DAT), in each sprouting bag, use about 50 the desolate ovum of maize seed be in 0.5mL distilled water.After infecting 7 days (DAI), measure the root length of each cucumber plant.To each process preparation 5 duplicate (bag).Carry out variance analysis, and use Student-Newman-Keul ' s HSD to be averaged variance analysis (α=0.05).To calculate control percentage relative to the average root length base infecting and do not infect the process of solvent blank example. 
 Table experiment-B.2.1: by compound treatment and desolate by maize seed (nuisance: lacquer putty kind desolate (Deliaplatura), ovum) infect after cucumber root length 
 
 
 
 Test compounds demonstrates the root length of raising, and therefore protection is in order to avoid the feeding damage of soil nuisance. 
 B.2.2 plant emergence, spray height and root quality in anti-western corn rootworm (Chrysomelidae (Chrysomelidae): corn root leaf A (Diabroticavirgifera virgifera)) process 
 Test in the compounds of this invention of formulation forms and other diamide compounds (chlorantraniliprole:
         with
         ) activity to western corn rootworm.Before process and plantation, filling soil mixture (1:1 loamy sand: sand) in basin also waters.Preparaton is diluted in distilled water, is then applied to the volume of 188 μ l on the 20g corn seed be in Hege 11 liquid seeds processor, and rotated for 30 seconds.1-3 days after treatment, plants 1 seed/basin.To each process preparation 5 duplicate (basin).Basin is placed in greenhouse in randomized complete block design mode, and every day is by top-watered.After planting 5-6 days (DAP), in every basin, infect 12 western corn rootworm larvas (2 age).After infecting, basin is remained on growth room's (26 DEG C, 10 h light: 14 h dark), and water from bottom if required.Evaluate plant emergence and the spray phytotoxicity of 5DAP.After infecting, 7 days (DAI) evaluates spray height and fresh quality.Carry out variance analysis, and use Student-Newman-Keul ' s HSD to be averaged variance analysis (α=0.05).
