 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to comprise streptococcus (Streptococcus), lactobacillus genus (Lactobacillus), propiono-bacterium (Propionibacterium), yeast (yeast), the culture supernatant of leuconos toc (Leuconostoc) and lactococcus (Lactococcus) promotes and/or reduces inhibitor as adiponectin (adiponectin) secretion of activeconstituents, give the adiponectin secretion to it and promote and/or reduce inhibiting new food and drink, and it is given adiponectin secretion promotion and/or reduces inhibiting new feed.Ingest described dose of the present invention and secretion from the adiponectin of fatty tissue is promoted and/or reduce and suppress.The reduction of adiponectin secretion causes morbidity and the deterioration by the compound metabolic syndrome that causes of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes etc., so the present invention is effective for its prevention and treatment. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Adipocyte excessive accumulation loose and interior fat triggers the morbidity of the plyability focus (complex lesion) of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, diabetes etc.These focuses are generically and collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome, and it has the big problem of human health recently, thereby its countermeasure becomes the task of top priority. 
 Visceral adipose tissue secretion internal secretion component as adiponectin, Type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and Leptin, and helps keeping of the interior homeostasis of life entity.Yet when adipocyte was loose, the secretion of these components became unusually, and it is excessive or not enough to secrete then.Recent studies have shown that the collapse dept ground of this balance participates in morbidity or the deterioration of metabolic syndrome.Wherein, think that the abnormal secretion of adiponectin has the influence (for example, referring to non-patent literature 1) of maximum. 
 Adiponectin is to have 244 amino acid whose molecules, and from the fatty tissue secretion, it not only shows the effect of improving insulin resistance, but also shows the effect of improving fat combustion in liver and the muscle.In addition, recognize that adiponectin has the glucose that promotes in the blood and lipid acid and takes in function in the cell.The accumulation of fat worsens the absorption of sugar in muscle and liver etc., causes diabetes.Yet, thereby as if adiponectin decomposes interim excess fats and the sugared nutritive equilibrium of keeping in the body usually.When obesity developed, the function reduction of adipocyte secretion adiponectin thought that the nutritive equilibrium in the body is damaged.By this way, expect the normalizing of adiponectin secretion, thereby have the effect of the symptom of general improvements metabolic syndrome such as hypertension, lipid metabolism obstacle and diabetes etc. 
 Sought and had medicine or the artificial compound who increases the adiponectin effect, but owing to exist and have the possibility of side effect, noted having picture suppresses the function of symptom development as far as possible by food habits the research of food ingredient.As many plant-derived extracts, disclosed comprising: Fructus Mali pumilae extract (for example, referring to patent documentation 1), hop residue (spent hop) extract (for example, referring to patent documentation 2), green tea catechins is (for example, referring to patent documentation 3), rice bran extract (for example, referring to patent documentation 4) and Rhizoma Curcumae Longae extract (for example, referring to patent documentation 5) etc.Yet the restriction that these have complicated extraction conditions and obtain the extract raw material demonstrates the reduction of local flavor when it is added into food.They are problematic as the applicability of prescription or food and beverage raw material. 
 On the other hand, the food (comprising cheese, yogurt and pickles) of having used lactobacillus-fermented is widely current, and supply that can be relatively cheap, in addition because its acceptable height mass production in the world just since ancient times.In addition, propiono-bacterium and yeast just are used for the production of cheese since ancient times, and help the fermentation (for example, referring to non-patent literature 2) of peculiar fragrance.These milk-acid bacterias, propiono-bacterium and yeast produce many degradation productions and meta-bolites.Wherein, though found many healthy functions compositions, think the component that also has Unknown Function. 
 The inventor has found to derive and come peptide to have the effect (for example, referring to patent documentation 6) that promotes that adiponectin produces from the milk-protein that the milk-acid bacteria ripened cheese separates.In addition, the increase that the applicant has found to use the culture of the lactic acid bacteria culture of degreasing milk medium, particularly lactobacillus gasseri (Lactobacillus gasseri) and Switzerland's lactobacillus (Lactobacillus helveticus) to have the adiponectin haemoconcentration promotes and/or reduces the effect (Japanese patent application 2006-244377) that suppresses. 
 Known milk-acid bacteria have the prevention pathogenic infection effect (for example, referring to patent documentation 7), the effect of prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome (irritable bowel syndrome) (for example, referring to patent documentation 8), (for example suppress bone resorption, referring to patent documentation 9), the effect of enhancing immunity system (for example, referring to patent documentation 10), the effect of prevent diabetes complication (for example, referring to patent documentation 11) and suppress the effect that serum cholesterol increases (referring to, patent documentation 12).Yet, do not know that culture supernatant (its for by removing the liquid ingredient that milk-protein throw out or cell component prepare the culture that also has propiono-bacterium and yeast from microorganism as milk-acid bacteria not only) has the effect that increases adiponectin separately. 
 The milk-protein throw out that solidifies by fermentation and cell component have a significant impact the local flavor tool of milk-product, and sometimes the deterioration quality, reduce value of the product.Also developed the technology (for example, referring to patent documentation 13) that is used for from milk fermentation raw material disgorging, the culture supernatant of giving the high milk fermentation raw material of food excellent flavor and acceptability has the industrial applicability of height as foodstuff raw material.
