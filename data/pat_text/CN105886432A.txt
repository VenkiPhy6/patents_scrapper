Pears rotten pathogenic bacteria (Valsa ambiens Pers), G red date alternaria (Alternaria sp.), H eggplant corruption reaping hook germ
(Fusarium solan), X melon and fruit corruption mould (Pythium aphanidermatum), Y Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn (Rhizoctonia
Solani): 
 (1) activation of bacterial strain: the ZF15 that picking one environmental protection is stored on nutrient agar panel lines on nutrient agar panel,
Cultivating 20h at 37 DEG C, picking one ring phytopathogen lines on PDA culture medium, cultivates 5d at 28 DEG C. 
 (2) ZF15 pure bacterium colony three ring obtained in picking step (1) is inoculated in 50mL beef extract-peptone fluid nutrient medium
In, 37 DEG C, 150r/min cultivate 72h, will fermentation after bacterium solution be centrifuged 10min through 5000r/min, take supernatant, through 0.22 μm
Membrane filtration, removes thalline, makes the aseptic ferment filtrate of ZF15. 
 (3) aseptic for endogenetic bacteria ZF15 ferment filtrate 200 μ L is coated on PDA plate, compare as being coated with 200 μ L aseptic
Water, the phytopathogen bacterium block taking a diameter of 1 × 1cm is put in PDA plate centre, cultivates 5d for 28 DEG C, measure colony diameter, meter
Calculate mycelial growth inhibition rate. 
 The computing formula of mycelial growth inhibition rate is as follows: 
 
 
 
 In formula, B is check plant pathogen colony growth diameter (mm)；T is phytopathy after painting endogenetic bacteria ferment filtrate
Former bacterium colony growth diameter (mm). 
 From measurement result, seeing accompanying drawing 5, ZF15 is to the operatic circle alternaria, walnut leaf spoting bacteria, red date black spot
Bacterium, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn have good inhibiting effect, mycelial growth inhibition rate to be respectively 73.44%, 78.90%, 65.64%,
76.90%, ZF15 are 22.85% to scraping and printing unit silk growth inhibition ratio. 
 By above-mentioned series embodiment, according to single by Hanshan Normal College phoenix from Fu Bin town, Chaozhou, Guangdong Province Raoping County
Sampling in clump tea root, sample is the root of tea tree, is collected in Fu Bin town, Chaozhou, Guangdong Province Raoping County, the age of tree 15,25 and 50 years, plants
Planting height above sea level 750m, tea tree breed is phoenix Dan Congcha narcissus, organic plantation, through using tissue mass cell culture to isolate root
Middle endogenetic bacteria, with different cultivation temperature, pH value, culture medium as enrichment condition, filters out a collection of well-grown Bacteria
Strain, the most preferably goes out the bacterial strain of a numbered ZF15 of strain.According to above morphological feature, with reference to " primary Jie Shi Bacteria Identification handbook " and
" common bacteria identification handbook " carries out taxonomic identification, and the order-checking of binding molecule biology to bacterial strain, and this bacterial strain of Preliminary Identification is bud
Spore bacillus (Bacillus sp.).Molecule sequencing result shows, bacillus (Bacillus sp.) ZF15GDMCC No:
The 16SrDNA gene order of 60016 is 1471bp, with ncbi database Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 (NR_
074540.1) homology is the highest, and the highest similitude is 94%, but the bacillus (Bacillus sp.) that the present invention provides
