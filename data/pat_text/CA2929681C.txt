Backoround to the Invention Probiotics are bacteria which confer health benefits to a host. Typically, cultures of probiotic bacterial strains are consumed or administered to individuals in order to supplement the naturally occurring bacteria population of the gut. A number of health benefits have been associated with probiotics, including reducing the incidence of cancer, .. diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome to name a few. Probiotics have the potential to help in the management in a number of physiological conditions and act to reduce the absorption of certain ingested substances, such as lipids. Preliminary studies also indicate that probiotics can be useful in reducing serum levels of cholesterol and blood pressure and help modulate diabetes and reduce weight. Lactobacilli are common probiotics in diary products and make up approximately 75% of probiotics currently sold. However, it has been estimated that only 2%  of Lactobacilli dose survives be effective in the gut. Prebiotics are dietary ingredients which can selectively enhance beneficial indigenous gut microbiota, such as lactobacilli or bifidobacteria, and are finding much increased application into the food sector. Prebiotics are non digestible food ingredients that are selectively metabolised by colonic bacteria which contribute to improved health. As such, their use can promote beneficial changes within the indigenous gut microbial milieu and they can therefore help survivability of probiotics. They are distinct from most dietary fibres like pectin, celluloses, xylan, which are not selectively metabolised in the gut.  Criteria for .. classification as a prebiotic is that it must resist gastric acidity, hydrolysis by mammalian Date Recue/Date Received 2020-10-08 enzymes and gastrointestinal absorption, it is fermented by intestinal microflora and selectively stimulates the growth and/or activity of intestinal bacteria associated with health and well-being. Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS, inulin and oligofructose) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) have been demonstrated to fulfil the criteria for prebiotic classification repeatedly in human intervention studies. Currently, no prebiotic for Lactobacilli exists. It is an object of the present invention to provide a combination of a Lactobacilli probiotic and specific prebiotic for the Lactobacilli which would be suitable for use in modifying the absorption of cholesterol in an individual. It would also be beneficial if the probiotic composition could also be used to treat other physiological conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity.

The basis of these experiments were to reversibly use p-galactosidases in microorganisms so as to produce a novel GOS. Ordinarily, 6-galactosidases would digest lactose. However, by changing the reaction conditions, in terms of substrate and temperature, the enzyme acts reversibly and generates an oligosaccharide version of the lactose (GOS). Lactobacilli are more frequently used as probiotics than are bifidobacteria, yet no prebiotic selective to lactobacilli exists. As these probiotics also harbour 6-galactosidase activity, the experiments induced the production of GOS which was specific to these probiotics. The metabolism of prebiotics like GOS are species specific (as evidenced by Bi-and Bifido bacteria), so a Lactobacilli GOS has the potentially enhance the growth, survivability, and health benefits of lactobacilli. The experiments undertaken were as follows: 1. Assemble and test a range of probiotic lactobacilli for their capacity to generate GOS and measuring 3-galactosidase activities;      2.    Generate a prebiotic GOS using the reverse enzyme procedure; 3.    Scale up of the novel molecule to allow in vitro testing; 4.    Compare survival and growth of lactobacilli in the absence and presence of the prebiotic in a series of 'gut model' experiments that test the probiotics and synbiotics; 5.    Assess the possibility for using GOS as encapsulation material for the lactobacilli; and 6.    Test delivery properties of the encapsulation material. The bacterial strains initially investigated during the first stage of the experiments are shown below in Table 1:

Bacterial count of several of the strains was assessed by using 0.1% lactose as the growth medium. Figures 1A ¨ 1F show that bacterial count over time using 0.1%  lactose as a growth medium for L. plantarum, L. casei, L. salivarius, L. fermentum, L.  rhanmosus, and L. delbrueckii all resulted in a steady growth curve from approximately 6.5 log10 CFU/ml to just over 9.5 log10 CFU/ml at around 13 hours and growth tailed off as it did not increase by 25 hours. Bacterial count of several of the strains was assessed by using 5% lactose as the growth medium. Figures 2A-2G show the bacterial count over time using 5%  lactose as a growth medium for L. plantarum, L. casei, L. salivarius, L. delbrueckii, L.  rhanmosus, L. acidophilus and L. helveticus.                                              Again, all resulted in a steady growth curve from  
 -10-approximately 6.5 10g10 CFU/ml to just over 9.5 10g10 CFU/ml at around 13 hours and growth was then flat as it did not increase by 25 hours. Cholesterol was then included in the culture medium of the bacterial strains and each strain tested for quantity of cholesterol after incubation.      The cholesterol assay used relies on the following formula: % cholesterol x dry weight (g)-1= (B-T/B x 100)/ W Where B= cholesterol content in the uninoculated control mg/I -1, T=  cholesterol in culture medium mg/I -1 and W= cells (dry weight g after 12h of inc). The pellet weight of the culture was measured independently of the supernanent and the spent broth (evaporated residues) also measured. The cholesterol assay was run in triplicate in several runs. Figure 3 shows the growth of different bacterial strains over 14 hours (0D600 measured every hour) in 0.4% oxgall and 100mg/L cholesterol concentration in MRS media and shows that some bacterial strains were much more effective at growing in this media. L. Planatarum showed the best growth profile, followed by L. delbrueckii, L.  casei and L. fermentum. Figure 3 shows the growth of different bacterial strains over 12 hours (01)600 measured every hour) in 0.4% oxgall and 100mg/L cholesterol concentration in MRS media and shows that some bacterial strains were much more effective at growing in this media. L. planatarum showed the best growth profile, followed by L. delbrueckii, L.  casei and L. fermentum. Figure 4 is a graph showing the results of different bacterial strains over 2 days prior to testing (0D600 measured every hour) in 0.4% oxgall and 100mg/L cholesterol  
 -11-concentration in MRS media. L. fermentum showed the best growth profile, followed by L.  rhanmosus, L. halveticus, L. halveticus and L. salivarius. Direct plate assay tests were then conducted on the strains to further measure cholesterol activity. Resting cell Bile Salt Hydrolase (BSH) activity was measured to assess the release of amino acids from hydrolysis of conjugated bile acids. Bile salt deconjugation (based upon the release of free cholic acid) was measured and finally co-precipitation of cholesterol with deconjugated bile assessed. Table 2 below shows the results of the direct plate assay. Bacteria                            18t run    2nd run    3rd run L. casei L. delbrueckii L. acidophilus L. fermentum                        X L. salivarius                       X          X          X L. halveticus                       Y          X          X L. rhamnosus                        X          X          X L. plantarum                        X L. salivarius*                      X          X          X L. fermentum*                       X          X Table 2 It can be seen that L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. acidophilus all had reliable BSH  activity. However, L. fermentum and L. plantarum also had successful growths (2 out of 3  
 -12-runs) and L. plantarum had previously proved particularly effective at growing on 0.4% oxgall and 100mg/L cholesterol as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. By comparing the results of the strains being able to grow in media containing cholesterol and those strains having BSH activity L. casei, L. delbrueckii, L.  fermentum and L. plantarum appeared to be suitable candidates for producing and identifying a specific prebiotic GOS. The GOS prebiotic generated by a specific strain has optimised metabolism not just to produce the GOS, but also to metabolise it (as it is generated from a reverse enzyme procedure). The GOS can therefore be incorporated with the probiotic into a synbiotic that would create a highly selective environment for the probiotic. As a probiotic can have a specific health benefits then a synbiotic formula which is tailored to a specific health benefit can be generated.   In parallel to Experiment 1, an initial high throughput screening (HTS) trial of 718 strains of Lactobacilli was conducted to assess the resistance to different types of bile salts. Further experiments were then conducted to investigate bile precipitation in 286 resistant strains in order to establish bile salt hydrolase activity. The strains tested were: Lactobacilli acidophilus, Lactobacilli helveticus, Lactobacilli alimentarius, Lactobacilli brevis, Lactobacilli buchneri, Lactobacilli casei (including subspecies: rhamnosus, casei, tolerans, pseudoplantarum, paracasei, alactotsus and rhamnosus), Lactobacilli crispatus, Lactobacilli curvatus (including subspecies: curvatus), Lactobacilli delbrueckii (including subspecies: bulgaricus and lactis), Lactobacilli fermentum, Lactobacilli panis, Lactobacilli paracasei (including subspecies: paracasei), Lactobacilli pentosus, Lactobacilli planatarum, Lactobacilli rhamnosus, Lactobacilli sakei, Lactobacilli salivarius (including subspecies: salivarius).  
 -13-Strains were grown overnight in MRS at 37 C. Of these cultures glycerol stocks were made and stored at -80 C. A microtiterplate was inoculated and all strains were placed in quadriplicate into masterplates. The bile salts used in these experiments were purchased from Sigma  and were as follows: Sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) (Sigma product number G3258, CAS:    34-0); sodium taurodeoxycholate hydrate (TDCA) (Sigma product number T0875, CAS:  207737-97-1) and Bile bovine (Oxgal) (Sigma product number B3883, CAS: 8008-63-7).  The concentrations of the bile salts used in the experiments were as follows:  0.5% GDCA;  0.5% TDCA; 0.5% oxgal; and 2.0% oxgal. In vitro data using glycodeoxycholate is believed to be more likely to reflect the likelihood of product efficacy as it more closely mimics the in vivo human environment. Overnight cultures were grown in 96 well plates in MRSA at 37 C. Then 5p1 of the cultures spotted into wells containing 150p1 MRSA agar with added bile salts in 96 well plates and incubated for 48 hours under aerobic/anaerobic conditions. pH  conditions were monitored so as to ensure proper growth of the strains. The results showed that certain strains do grow on the MRSA plates under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Table 3 below shows all of the positive results from the initial HIS where a particular strain is capable of growing (assessed by measurement of 0D600) on a range of bile salts under anaerobic conditions: .c                                      .c    .a    .c    .c    .c    .c    .c .1.

Y     Y    Y    Y    Y     Y     Y    Y Salivarius Table 3 Figure 5 illustrates that many strains grow well in MRSA under aerobic conditions.  As shown in Figure 7, GDCA inhibits growth of the strains in all cases under aerobic conditions but as shown in Figure 6 under anaerobic conditions some strains do grow in GDCA. 2.0% Oxgal was found to inhibit the growth of some strains in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The plates in Figures 6 and 7 show good growth for the following strains: (Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8026, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC  11976, Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826, Lactobacillus plantarum AbBio, Lactobacillus helveticus LBK-16H, Lactobacillus plantarum WCF51 ( 1836), Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 30187, Lactobacillus plantarum 299 (1837). When these results are compared with the growth data of comparative strains grown in a medium containing 100mg/L  cholesterol in Experiment 1 (and illustrated in Figures 3 and 4) it appears that Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum have excellent growth in the presence of cholesterol and are resistive to bile salts and have bile salt hydrolase activity. Table 4 below shows a brief summary of the growth results: Media                        Strains grown at 20 / 72 hours 0.5% TDCA                    163 / 208 0.5% GDCA                    38 / 45 0.5% Oxgal                   116 / 160 2.0% Oxgal                   84 / 103 Table 4 A total of 41 strains were found to grow in the presence of all three bile salts present at 0.5%. Bile salt hydrolase activity in resistant strains was then assessed by spotting 5  I into "PCR tube plate" (150p1 of agar in a thin walled microcentrifuge tubes). These tube plates were grown under the same conditions as the 96 well plates (MRS + 0.5% TDCA, MRS +  0.5% GDCA, MRS + 0.5% oxgal, MRS + 2.0% oxgal, MRS without bile (control)). The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37  C and bile precipitation (related to bile salt hydrolase activity) was assessed after 24 and 48h using the following scoring system: Record growth as + or ¨ for BSH activity. The positives were then selected for subsequent streaking onto MRS plates containg 0.5% oxgal. After 72 hours, positive strains had been identified. The positive cultures only showed precipitation in GDCA and TDCA. Figure 8 shows the range of strains used in the initial high throughput screening assay.     After narrowing down the number of strains to 24 based on earler BSH activity, further screening of the cholesterol assimilation in MRS medium supplemented with 0.4%  was conducted.    Table 3 below shows the results of the selected strains and their average % cholesterol reduction.

The in vitro tests conducted strongly suggest that these strains, whether in combination with one another or individually, would be suitable for use in modifying the absorption of cholesterol or in the treatment of heart disease, diabetes or obesity in an individual. These strains could be used in conjunction with growth specific prebiotics to encourage and support growth.     Experiments were then conducted to look at how well a number of strains coped with being freeze dried and also the subsequent BSH activity towards specific bile salts of three selected strains. The first step was to ferment a number of strains. Strains were found to acidify all carriers and cryoprotectants chosen. It was assessed that formulations should be worked cold during production. The choice of carriers and their final concentrations were as follows:  82 /oMD + 14% Sorbitol (MD = maltodextrin) (rest medium, and bacteria) and 82%  MD +  
 14% Sucrose. All strains grew well on the Nitrogen sources selected with a mix of Yeast extract and Soy peptone. No animal ingredients were suggested for the validation, but it was assessed that the soy peptone may cause insoluble precipitate, which could hinder the downstream processing in the future. Ideally, it was assessed that the medium to be used in production is based on 100% YE, with no other Nitrogen sources. Table 7 below shows the summary of the results of the fermentation and viability rates for the three chosen strains (B4321, B2828 and B2830) in the media. In the following data, B4321 relates to the same strain as B2691 referred to earlier. Strain                B4321 (B2691)    B2828               B2830 Media                 Sorbitol    Sucrose        Sorbitol    Sucrose Sorbitol    Sucrose Coagulation           YES              NO                  NO 0Dmax-fermentation    9.5              12.9                15.7 CFU-fermentation      7.5E+09          1.4E+10             1.6E+10 Cells/OD              8E+08            1E+09               1E+09 Conversion factor in 24%       24%     18%       17%       14%     14% Carrier CFU in Carrier solution 3.9E+09    4.1E+09       2.1E+09    2.5E+09    1.8E+09 2.2E+09 (30% DM) CFU in powder         3.24E+09 4.12E+09 2.35E+09    2.82E+09    1.38E+09 2.62E+09 Survival freeze drying    28%    34%    39%      39%       27%     41% Table 7 Figure 11 shows the powder counts for a number of strains, whereas Figure 12 shows the freeze drying survival of those same strains. Figure 13 shows the survival of the strains in the stomach. Strain B4321 (B2691) clearly survives better under the conditions tested H09 CFU/mL Stationary cells incubated for 60 min at pH 2.45 in a Na/K/HCI solution with Pepsin adn lipase. Figures 14 and 15 show the Bile Salt Hydrolase activity on the chosen strains.  B2828 and B2830 converted nearly 100% of the substrate in 3 hrs. Therefore no discrimination appeared to be possible between these strains. The forgoing embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the protection afforded by the claims, but rather to describe examples of how the invention may be put into practice. Deposition of Biological Material A deposition of biological material was made for the purposes of a United Kingdom patent application at the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC) in the UK. The NCTC is a recognised International Depository Authority (IDA) under the Budapest Treaty. Each of the strains deposited at the NCTC in the UK have been assigned a number with the prefix ECGC. ECGC stands for European Culture General Collection. It should be noted that B2691 (ECGC 13110401) was originally phenotypically classified as a L. reteri upon deposition at the NCTC. It has subsequently been found to be a L. plantarum based upon genetic analysis and this strain is referred to in this application as B2691 and renamed B4321 in later experiments.
