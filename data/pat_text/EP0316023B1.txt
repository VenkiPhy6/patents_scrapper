     This invention relates to novel plasmids, methods for their construction, transformed microorganisms carrying them and to methods for the extracellular production of xylanase by cultivation of the microorganisms. The novel plasmids carry DNA sequences encoding the enzyme xylanase and are capable of inducing the extracellular secretion of the high-molecular xylanase by corresponding transformed microorganisms. 
     
    
    [0002]
     Plasmids are non-chromosomal elements of circular DNA found in a microorganism cell. Plasmids are currently being used as a means for recombination of microorganism genes and are becoming more and more important in the field of fermentation industry. 
     
    
    [0003]
     Studies have recently been effected on plasmids carrying a foreign DNA which carries the genetic information for metabolic products of specific demand for the growth of microorganisms, as shown in the production of amino acids or peptides. Some plasmids have been introduced into host microorganisms to obtain transformants. Methods have been proposed for producing relatively low molecular compounds such as amino acids and peptides by cultivating the transformants. However, the degree of propagation of plasmids carrying genes for production of high-molecular substances depends on the nature of the host microorganisms and those plasmids have not effectively been expressed. Furthermore, no effective methods for the cultivation of such transformants have been established. 
     
    
    [0004]
     It has not been possible to selectively obtain a certain extracellular high-molecular product by cultivating a microorganism transformed with a plasmid carrying a foreign DNA fragment carrying the genetic information for the extracellular production of high-molecular substances which are metabolic products of other microorganisms. Such extracellular production has not successfully been done even when a transformant of  Escherichia  species, which is usually used as a host microorganism, is used. 
     
    
    [0005]
     US Patent 4,411,994 of W.Gilbert et al discloses a process for producing specific proteins in bacteria and having them excreted from the bacterial cell. This process comprises inserting the DNA coding for the desired non-bacterial protein or part of a protein by recombinant techniques into a plasmid or phage gene which codes for either a periplasmic or an extracellular protein, hereinafter called a "carrier protein", then transforming a bacterial host with the recombinant DNA and culturing the transformed host to excrete the protein. The process of this patent provides a means for producing a selected protein by employing a gene for a carrier protein which has a leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at its amino terminus. 
     
    
    [0006]
     The cell wall of  Escherichia coli  which has often been used for the production of useful physiologically active substances, consists of three kinds of membranes: an inner membrane, peptidoglycan and an outer membrane. The space between the inner and outer membrane is called the periplasmic space. The process of US Patent 4,411,994 permitted the excretion of the products into the periplasmic space but not into the culture medium through the outer membrane or outside of the bacterial host cell. The present invention permits the excretion of xylanase through the outer membrane of the host microorganism and its direct recovery from the culture medium by insertion of a DNA sequence carrying the genetic information for the extracellular production of the enzyme xylanase, a high-molecular substance, into a plasmid, whereby a hybrid plasmid is obtained and by culturing the host microorganism transformed with said hybrid plasmid. Thus, the present invention permits the mass production of the enzyme xylanase which has never been possible by prior art processes. 
     
    
    [0007]
     Therefore, the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide novel plasmids containing a DNA sequence carrying the genetic information for the extracellular production of xylanase, methods for their construction, transformed microorganisms carrying the plasmids and to provide methods for the cultivation of the microorganisms for the extracellular production of xylanase. The plasmids of the present invention are constructed from a vector plasmid and a DNA fragment carrying the genetic information for the extracellular production of xylanase. Such DNA fragments are obtained from microorganisms of the genus  Bacillus.  The term "extracellular production" means that the xylanase produced by the host microorganism is secreted into the culture medium. 
The recombinant plasmids of the present invention which are capable of inducing the extracellular secretion of xylanase in bacteria of the genus Escherichia are obtainable by carrying out the following steps:
       (a) preparing with a restriction enzyme, preferably with Hind III, a chromosomal DNA fragment of Bacillus sp. C 125 (FERM BP-469) which codes for the extracellular secretion of xylanase;   (b) preparing the recombinant plasmid DNA by ligating the chromosomal DNA fragment obtained in step (a) into a vector plasmid which was digested with a suitable restriction enzyme, preferably Hind III   (d) isolating the recombinant plasmid DNA from a transformed host cell which exhibits a xylanase-producing phenotype.   
   
    
    [0008]
     The transformed host microorganisms of the present invention belong to the genus  Escherichia.  They are capable of of secreting the xylanase encoded by the incorporated plasmid of the present invention. 
     
    
    [0009]
     The present invention also provides a method for cultivation of the transformed host microorganisms, which comprises inoculating the microorganism into a culture medium containing an inorganic salt necessary for the microorganism to grow, or in a culture medium containing a selected carbon source together with the inorganic salt, keeping on culturing the microorganism after the concentration of the microorganism cells has reached the maximum and until the production and accumulation of the xylanase in the media reached the maximum.

    [0015]
     The present invention will now be explained in detail. 
   (a) The Plasmids and their Construction 
   
    
    [0016]
     The novel plasmids of the present invention are constructed by inserting a foreign DNA into a plasmid (extrachromosomal DNA or vector DNA), such as Col E₁, found in  Escherichia  cells. 
     
    
    [0017]
     The vector DNA which can be used in the present invention may have been isolated from natural sources. 
     
    
    [0018]
     The DNA fragments unnecessary for self-reproduction may have been deleted. Specific examples for vectors which may be used are the plasmids ColE₁, pMB9, pBR322, pSC101, R6K and lambda phage. 
     
    
    [0019]
     Foreign DNA fragments or exogenates which can be inserted into the vector DNA are the genes having genetic information of extracellular production or secretion of high-molecular substances, such as enzyme proteins, for example, xylanase, penicillinase, alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, amylase, protease, β-glucanase, cellulase. 
     
    
    [0020]
     Exogenates or DNA fragments which can be used in the present invention include the genes having genetic information of extracellular production or secretion of high molecular substances. They are obtained from a microorganism which belongs to, for example, the genus  Bacillus . 
     
    
    [0021]
     An example of a microorganism containing DNA which has genetic information of extracellular xylanase production and which can be used in the present invention is  Bacillus  sp. C125. 
     
    
    [0022]
       Bacillus  sp. C125 was isolated from a soil sample collected in Tsurugashima, Saitama, Japan and shows the following characteristic microbiological properties. Examination and classification of this strain were done according to "Aerobic Spore-forming Bacteria" (United State Department of Agriculture, Nov. 1952 by N.R. Smith, R.E. Gordon & F.E. Clark) and "Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (1957)".

     Summarizing the properties above, it is clear that the microorganism belongs to the genus  Bacillus  because it is an aerobic, spore-forming bacterium. The microorganism  Bacillus  sp. C125 is a new strain of alkalophilic bacteria. It is clearly different from known bacteria in that it grows at a pH lower than 11.0 and at a temperature lower than 55°C. 
     
    
    [0028]
     For the purpose of the insertion of foreign DNA into a vector DNA, any conventional method can be used in the present invention. For instance, chromosomal DNA is digested with a suitable restriction enzyme or endonuclease to obtain a foreign DNA fragment or an exogenote which is then mixed with a vector DNA which has been treated with the same restriction enzyme, and the mixture is ligated by a suitable ligase. Thus, as described before, the novel plasmids of the present invention can be obtained by preparing, with a restriction enzyme, a DNA fragment coding for the extracellular production of xylanase, digesting a plasmid vector DNA with a restriction enzyme which does not interfere with the genetic information carried on the DNA fragment, treating the DNA fragment and the digested vector plasmid with DNA ligase to construct a recombinant plasmid and isolating the recombinant plasmid by a conventional manner [see Bolivar et. al., Gene, 2, 95 (1977)]. 
     
    
    [0029]
     The novel plasmid pCX311 can be constructed from a fragment of  Bacillus  sp. C125 chromosomal DNA and plasmid pBR322. The restriction enzyme map for plasmid pCX311 is shown in Fig. 4. As seen in Fig. 4, plasmid pCX311 is constructed from plasmid pBR322 into which the fragment of  Bacillus  sp. C125 chromosomal DNA coding for the extracellular xylanase production is inserted at the Hind III restriction site of plasmid pBR322. Thus, plasmid pCX311 is a cyclic DNA molecule of about 9.01 kb, consisting of pBR322 DNA and a fragment of  Bacillus  sp. C125 DNA of about 4.0 kb. 
   (b) Preparation of Microorganisms 
   
    
    [0030]
     The recombinant plasmids constructed from the chromosomal DNA fragments and the vector DNA plasmids are introduced into a host microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  by a conventional transformation technique. Cultivation is kept on until a stabilized genotype is established, to obtain a transformant carrying both genotypes on the selected chromosomal DNA and on the vector DNA. For this purpose, a conventional, so called shot gun method can be used. 
     
    
    [0031]
     A typical host microorganism which can be used in the present invention is  Escherichia coli  HB101 which is a hybrid strain of  Escherichia coli  K-12 and  Escherichia coli  B. 
     
    
    [0032]
     The transformant,  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) which is prepared by introducing plasmid pCX311 into    Escherichia coli      HB  101 has the same microbiological properties as the host,  Escherichia coli  HB101, except penicillin resistance and xylanase production [Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, p.504 (1982), Genotype: F⁻, hsd S 20(r           -       B             , m           -       B             ), rec A13, ara-14, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20(Sm'), xyl-5 mtl-1, supE44λ⁻].  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) is further characterized by the property of plasmid pCX311, that is, the capability of extracellular production of xylanase. 
     
    
    [0033]
     The extracellular production of xylanase by  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311), as shown in the Examples, reaches more than 80% of total production including the intracellular production and remains after long cultivation. By contrast, extracellular production or activity of xylanase of  Bacillus  sp. C125, as shown in Fig. 3, reaches the maximum slowly and then, it drops rapidly. Thus, the extracellular production of  Bacillus  sp. C125 can not be compared with that of  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) of the present invention. 
     
    
    [0034]
     The present invention which provides  Escherichia coli  HB 101 (pCX311) having the capability of extracellular production of enzyme proteins such as xylanase is not only novel but also inventive.  E. coli  HB101 (pCX311) can produce and secrete into the medium from the cells, in addition to large amounts of xylanase, large amounts of other enzyme proteins which can also be collected. More specifically, it has been discovered that  Escherichia coli  HB 101 (pCX311) produces and secretes into the medium from the cells, as shown in the Examples, large amounts of penicillinase, alkaline phosphatase, in addition to xylanase which have ever been observed only in the periplasmic space. 
     
    
    [0035]
     Such extracellular production by  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) demonstrates that the DNA of about 4000 nucleotide base pairs carried on plasmid pCX311 provides the host with the capability of extracellular production of the metabolic products. 
   (c) Cultivation of the microorganisms 
   
    
    [0036]
     For culturing the transformants prepared in step (b), any culture media can be used which are suitable for the production of specific substances for which specific genetic information codes and which are suitable for growth of the microorganisms of the genus  Escherichia . In the process of the present invention, it is necessary to culture the microorganism in a culture medium containing an inorganic salt necessary for the microorganism to grow, or a selected carbon source together with the inorganic salt, and to keep on culturing the microorganism, after the concentration of the microorganism cells reached the maximum, and until the production and accumulation of the high-molecular substances in the media reach the maximum. 
     
    
    [0037]
     Examples of the inorganic salt which can be used in the present invention include sodium and potassium salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride and the like, among which sodium chloride is preferred. The media containing the inorganic salt or the selected carbon source together with the inorganic salt can contain such carbon sources as glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, glycerol, bran, xylan and the like, such nitrogen sources as ammonia water, ammonium salts, inorganic ions and optionally such nutrients as amino acids, vitamins. In the culture of  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311), it is important and necessary to add to the medium the carbon source suitable for a selected product. The culture media which can be used in the present invention are those which use, as a basic medium, LB-broth (containing tryptone, yeast extract and NaCl), BPB-broth (Difco Laboratories; containing polypeptone, yeast extract and K₂HPO₄), nutrient broth (Difco 0001), tryptone-NaCl broth. 
     
    
    [0038]
     Since more than 80% of total products remain in the intracellular fraction in a medium containing no inorganic salt, it is necessary to use a medium containing an inorganic salt in order that most products are secreted into the culture medium out of the cells. The amount of inorganic salt used is in the range of 0.5 - 3.0% by weight on the basis of the culture medium. 
     
    
    [0039]
     In the culture of  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311), excellent results are obtained by the use of LB-broth to which bran and/or xylan have been added as carbon sources, preferably in the amount each of 0.5% by weight on the basis of the culture medium. 
     
    
    [0040]
     Although culture conditions such as pH, temperature or oxygen supply can be changed for the optimum growth of the microorganism of the genus  Escherichia , it is necessary, in the present invention, to keep on culturing the microorganism, after the concentration of the microorganism cells reached the maximum, that is to say, after the latter logarithmic phase and until the production and accumulation of the high-molecular substances in the medium reach the maximum. 
     
    
    [0041]
     After the inoculation of the microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  in the medium, the cell concentration reaches the maximum after 5 to 20 hours and the production and accumulation of the high-molecular substances reach the maximum after 12 to 48 hours. Although the pH of the culture medium is not critical, it is preferred in the range of pH5 - pH8, especially pH7. Thus, without further addition of inorganic salt necessary for the microorganism to grow, carbon sources and the like during cultivation, the microorganism produces large amounts of extracellular high-molecular substances which can conveniently be collected. 
     
    
    [0042]
     According to the culture method of the present invention, in addition to enzyme proteins, such high-molecular fermentation products as antibiotics, polysaccharides can be produced in a significant amount. This method can be applied to the cultivation of any microorganisms transformed with a plasmid carrying a foreign DNA coding for biologically active high-molecular substances such as hormone peptides (e.g. insulin) or interferon and the DNA coding for extracellular production or secretion of biologically active high-molecular substances, which leads to mass production of the high-molecular substances such as insulin, interferon and the like. 
     
    
    [0043]
     As explaind above, the present invention contributes to the industrial production of useful high-molecular substances.

   Example 1 
 (1) Preparation of a chromosomal DNA having genetic information for the production of xylanase. 
   
    
    [0051]
     Alkalophilic  Bacillus  sp. C125 (FERM BP-469) having the capability of extracellular production of xylanase was cultured with shaking at 30°C for 19 hours in the broth (containing 10.0g of bran, 5.0g of yeast extract, 5.0g of polypeptone, 0.2g of MgSO₄·7H₂O, and 10g of Na₂CO₃ in one liter of water and adjusted to pH 9.0). The cells in the latter logarithmic phase were collected, from which a chromosomal DNA was extracted by the phenol extraction method and purified to obtain 5mg of the chromosomal DNA. 
   (2) Insertion of chromosomal DNA fragment into vector DNA. 
   
    
    [0052]
     The chromosomal DNA (10µg) obtained in step (1) was digested with the restriction enzyme Hind III at 37°C for 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes to obtain DNA fragments. 
     
    
    [0053]
     Plasmid pBR322 [Bethesda Research Laboratories, U.S.A., tetracyclin resistant (Tet r ) and ampicillin resistant (Amp  r )] used as the vector was cut with Hind III, then heated at 65°C for 5 minutes, and then mixed with the DNA fragments. The mixture was treated with T₄ phage DNA ligase at 10°C for 24 hours and then heated at 65°C for 5 minutes. 
     
    
    [0054]
     Three times volume of ethanol was added to the mixture. Plasmids carrying the chromosomal DNA fragments were precipitated and collected. 
   (3) Transformation of the microorganism with plasmids having gene for extracellular production of xylanase. 
   
    
    [0055]
       Escherichia coli  HB101 which is a hybrid strain of  Escherichia coli  K-12 and  Escherichia coli  B, was inoculated in 10ml of LB-broth [containing 10g of tryptone (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 5g of yeast extract, 1g of glucose and 10g of NaCl in one liter of deionized water; pH was adjusted to 7.0] and cultured at 37°C with shaking until the latter logarithmic phase. The cells were collected and suspended in an ice-cold CaCl₂ solution of 0.03M (final concentration) to obtain competent cells. The cell suspension and the plasmid solution obtained in step (2) were combined and kept on ice for 60 minutes. The mixture was heated to 42°C for 1 to 2 minutes to introduce the plasmid DNA into the cells. This cell suspension was inoculated in fresh LB-broth and cultured at 37°C for 3 to 5 hours with shaking. The cells were collected and washed to obtain transformants, from which  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) (FERM BP-470) having extracellular producibility of xylanase and penicillinase was isolated. 
   Example 2 : see above 
 Example 3 
   
    
    [0056]
       Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) (FERM BP-470) obtained in step (3) of Example 1 was inoculated in 500ml-flasks containing 100ml of LB-broth (containing 10g of tryptone, 5g of yeast extract, 1g of glucose, 2g of glycerol, 10g of NaCl and 10mg of penicillin in one liter of water) containing 0.5% xylan and cultured at 37°C with shaking. Cell growth was measured by optical density at 660nm. Enzyme activity was assayed as follows: 0.05ml of the culture fluid, 0.1ml of xylan solution (Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan) and 0.1ml of 0.2M Tris-malate buffer of pH8.0 were mixed and heated at 40°C for 10 minutes. One ml of DNS (3.5-dinitrosalicylic acid) was added to the mixture, which was then heated at 100°C for 5 minutes. Four ml of water was added to the mixture. Absorbance at 510nm was measured. One unit of xylanase reduces one mg of xylose per one minute. 
     
    
    [0057]
     Fig. 1 shows extracellular production or secretion of xylanase by  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) cultured in the LB-broth containing 0.5% xylan. 
     
    
    [0058]
     As shown in fig. 1, cell growth of the transformant reached the maximum after 9 to 12 hours cultivation and extracellular xylanase activity began to increase after 6 hours and reached the maximum (about 0.35 unit/ml) after 13 hours cultivation. 
     
    
    [0059]
     Extracellular xylanase produced was very stable and, as shown in fig. 5, the production was kept high even after 48 hours cultivation and reached more than 80% of total enzyme production. In contrast, intracellular xylanase production was detected a little at an early phase (after 9 hours cultivation). But, the maximum was only 0.13 unit/ml or about 10% of total enzyme production and furthermore, the intracellular production decreased gradually. Fig. 2 shows xylanase production by  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) cultured in the LB-broth containing 0.5% bran instead of xylan. Fig. 2 shows the similar tendency as observed in Fig. 1. As a comparison,  Bacillus  sp. C125 (FERM BP-469) which is a DNA donor was cultured and xylanase activity was assayed. 
     
    
    [0060]
       Bacillus  sp. C125 was inoculated in 500ml-flasks containing 100ml of the medium (which contained 10.0g of xylan, 5.0g of yeast extract, 5.0g of polypeptone, 1.0g of K₂HPO₄, 0.2g of MgSO₄·7H₂O and 10g of Na₂CO₃ in one liter of water and was adjusted to pH 6.0) and cultured at 37°C with shaking. Extracellular xylanase activity in the culture fluid was observed every eight hours. It began to increase after eight hours cultivation and reached the maximum (about 0.5 unit/ml) after 48 hours, but it decreased quickly (Fig. 3). 
   [Identification of xylanase] 
   
    
    [0061]
     Ammonium sulfate was added to the culture fluid of the transformant obtained in step (3) of Example 1. The precipitate salted out was dissolved in water and the solution was dialyzed overnight against running water. The dialyzate was adsorbed on a CM-cellulose column equilibrated with 20mM phosphoric acid-monosodium phosphate buffer of pH 4.5. Elution was done by applying a linear gradient of 0.1-0.7M sodium chloride. Xylanase was eluted with about 0.4M sodium chloride. The fractions exhibited xylanase activity were combined and applied on a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration to obtain purified xylanase.

     For the identification of  Escherichia coli  HB101 (pCX311) xylanase with  Bacillus  sp. C125 xylanase, effects of pH on activity, ultracentrifugal analysis, electrophoresis and estimation of molecular weight of each xylanase were examined. As a result, both the enzymes were identical with each other as shown below.
       (a) Acetate (pH 4 - 5), Tris-malate (pH 5 - 8), Tris-HCl (pH 7 -9), and glycine-NaOH (pH 9 - 11) were prepared. Using these buffer solutions, effects of pH on activity was examined. Results are shown in Fig. 5 which exhibits the identification of both the enzymes on pH activity.   (b) Ultracentrifugal analysis showed that both the enzymes had single peak of about 3.5S of sedimentation coefficient.   (c) Desk electrophoresis at pH 8.3 showed that both the enzymes had single band. Electrofocusing by Ampholine showed single peak. Isoelectric point of both the enzymes was pH6.3.   (d) Estimation of molecular weight of the enzymes was done by SDS-polyacrylamide method. Estimated molecular weight of both the enzymes was about 40,000.
