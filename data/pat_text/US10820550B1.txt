 The present invention relates to a new, distinct and stable variety of  Buglossoides arvensis , hereinafter referred it as ‘Portland’. The present invention relates to seeds which are the  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘Portland’, as well as, plants and the plant parts produced by these seeds which have all the morphological and physiological characteristics of the  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘Portland’. The present invention also relates to methods for producing these seeds and plants of the  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘Portland’. Furthermore, the present invention relates to method of producing progeny  Buglossoides  plants by crossing  Buglossoides  ‘Portland’, as either the female or seed or male or pollen parent, with another  Buglossoides  plant and selecting progeny. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a new, distinct and stable variety of  Buglossoides arvensis , and hereinafter referred to by the variety denomination ‘Portland’. The new  Buglossoides  ‘Portland’ originated from the process of selection of wild collected seed, which was germinated, observed selected and subsequently self-pollinated. Germination, selection and self-crossing were made as part of a controlled breeding program by the inventor at a research greenhouse and outdoor field facility in Cambridge, England. The new variety was initially selected June 2013. The selected seed line was first multiplied in pots and an outdoor field during the summer of 2013 Cambridge, England. 
   Buglossoides  is a member of the Boraginaceae family.  Buglossoides  is a genus consisting of 15 species of annual or perennial herbs, native to Europe and Asia. They grow naturally in habitats ranging from sunny scrub to rocky slopes and woodland areas. 
   Buglossoides  has been identified as a potentially interesting commercial crop for seed production, with the seeds useful for oil production. The oil derived from  Buglossoides  trades under the commercial name Ahiflower oil. Research has shown that vegetable oils containing stearidonic acid (SDA) could be a dietary source of n-3 fatty acids that would be more effective in increasing tissue eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations than are current alpha linolenic acid (ALA) containing vegetable oils. The use of SDA-containing oils in food manufacture could provide a wide range of dietary alternatives for increasing tissue EPA concentrations. Ahiflower oil is indicated to be a more efficient omega-3 alternative to flax, chia, and other ALA-rich dietary oils. 
 Seeds of  Buglossoides  have been approved for the above mentioned use by the FDA. 
   Buglossoides  can be propagated by vegetative, asexual practices. However, this method is impractical for commercial field purposes. 
 Methods for cultivation and crossing of  Buglossoides  are not well known. However, it is known some varieties are suitable for Winter production, requiring vernalization, whereas some varieties will not require vernalization and produce seeds during the Summer season from Spring planting. 
   Buglossoides arvensis  plants are known to produce seeds prolifically. To produce a commercial crop, it has been necessary to address the issue of variety stability, as well as seed dormancy. The inventor has developed a new variety which can be self-pollinated and reproduced true to try from seed. Plants produced by this method are uniform with respect their morphological and physiological characteristics. 
 A need exists for a greater variety of  Buglossoides  cultivars for commercial seed production, under a variety of environmental conditions. Additionally, a need exists for additional  Buglossoides arvensis  cultivars that can be easily propagated by seed, with consistent results. The new  Buglossoides  Portland was developed through a controlled breeding program and exhibits unique, desirable and stable characteristics. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention provides  Buglossoides  plant selections that can be planted in the Winter, requiring vernalization to produce seeds during Summer. Additionally, plants of ‘Portland’ typically produce many side shoots, with these side shoots starting to emerge at a lower section of the main stem than typical of  Buglossoides . Plants begin flowering uniquely early. Germination rate of the new variety is typically around 80%, much higher than typical for  Buglossoides . Plants are cold hardy, with improved Autumnal survival rate, observed to tolerate temperatures as low as −5° C. Additionally, plants have a superior quality to retain seeds on the plant. Agronomic performance and oil content are consistent and desirable for commercial purposes. These qualities distinguish the new cultivar from typical  Buglossoides arvensis  varieties. 
 These and other objectives have been achieved in accordance with the present invention which provides ‘Portland’ as a new  Buglossoides  cultivar that is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor Philip Howell, in Cambridge, England. 
 The new variety ‘Portland’ can be produced by sexual reproduction by to produce a population of progeny plants, each of which has the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new variety ‘Portland’. 
 2500 seeds [which are the] of variety ‘Portland’ were deposited and accepted on Jan. 30, 2020 at the National Collection of Industrial Food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB), Ferguson Building, Bucksburn, Aberdeen, Scotland, a Budapest Treaty recognized depository which affords permanence of the deposit, and accorded International Depository Authority Accession No. NCIMB-43566.

 DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION 
 The present invention was developed by the inventor, Philip Howell in Cambridge, England. 
 This invention is directed to a  Buglossoides arvensis  plant having all the morphological and physiological characteristics of the variety ‘Portland’ produced from seeds 
 The new  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘Portland’ can also be produced by asexually reproducing progeny. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by vegetative means by cuttings was first performed in 2013, in Cambridge, England. The first ‘Portland’ plants propagated through the use of such cuttings are maintained in Cambridge, England and have reproduced at least 5 generations. Subsequent asexual reproduction has demonstrated that the new cultivar reproduces true-to-type and that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. 
 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘Portland’ which in combination distinguish this  Buglossoides  as a new and distinct cultivar:
         1. Many side shoots (starting from lower down the main stem).   2. Large seed (TSW typically 5.3 g).   3. Good germination rate—typically 80%.   4. Good seed retention on plant.   5. Good autumn survival (survives −5° C.).   6. Winter variety, requiring vernalization.       
 Of the few commercial cultivars known to the present inventor, the most similar in comparison to the new  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘Portland’ is the unnamed, unpatented  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘FitzRoy’, U.S. Pat. No. 9,648,831. ‘Portland’ differ from plants of ‘FitzRoy’ in the following:
         1. ‘Portland’ stands taller in the field.   2. ‘Portland’ produces more side shoots per plant.   3. ‘Portland’ flowers can show blue coloration as they fade; any coloration in ‘FitzRoy’ is through yellow/cream.   4. ‘Portland’ bears larger seed (TSW 5.3 g versus ‘FitzRoy’ 2.4 g).   5. ‘Portland’ shows better resistance to powdery mildew, especially later in the season.       
 ‘Portland’ can also be compared to a  Buglossoides arvensis  ‘Malin’, U.S. Pat. No. 9,439,379. Plants of ‘Malin’ differ from plants of ‘Portland’ in the following:
         1. ‘Portland’ is a Winter type and requires vernalisation to initiate flowering.   2. From equivalent autumn sowings, ‘Portland’ gives a higher plant population coming into spring.   3. ‘Portland’ shows much better seed retention at full crop maturity.       
 ‘Portland’ has not been tested and observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity, frequency of fertilization, composition of fertilizer, flowering treatment, day length and humidity, without any change in the genotype of the plant. 
 For example, substantial differences in plant height and diameter; quantity of seeds produced can occur, depending upon environmental conditions and planting density. 
 The aforementioned photograph, together with the following observations, measurements and values describe the new  Buglossoides  ‘Portland’ as grown outdoors in Hertfordshire, England. Plants of ‘Portland’ were grown outdoors in a research field with temperatures ranging from approximately 5° C. to 18° C. during the day and night temperatures ranging from −5° C. to 7° C. No artificial lighting or photoperiodic treatments were conducted. Plants were germinated at 8° C. in calcareous soil.
