 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Field 
 Provided is an anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody including a) an anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and b) an anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition including the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody. 
 2. Description of the Related Art 
 Angiopoietin2 (Ang2) is an antagonistic ligand of receptor Tie2 present in vascular endothelial cell (Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2009 March; 10(3):165-77), and competes with Angiopoietin1 (Ang1) which is an agonist of Tie2 for binding to Tie2, thereby inhibiting the signal transduction by Tie2 (Science. 1997 Jul. 4; 277(5322):55-60). Therefore, Ang2 inhibits Ang1-Tie2 signal transduction for maintaining stability of vascular endothelial cells, leading to stimulation of angiogenesis by dynamic rearrangement of blood vessels (Science. 1997 Jul. 4; 277(5322):48-50). Preclinical studies suggest that the inhibition of the Tie2-dependent Ang2 functions can lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis, thereby preventing additional growth of cancer (J Natl Cancer Inst. 2012 Mar. 21; 104(6):461-75). However, the recent studies suggested that when a cancer cell is treated with an angiogenesis inhibitor, a mechanism for avoiding the sudden oxygen deficiency condition is activated in the cancer cell, which can stimulate cancer metastasis (Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar. 1; 8(4):210-21). Therefore, to avoid such serious side effects of angiogenesis inhibitors, it is necessary to inhibit functions of cancer metastasis-related proteins as well. 
 C-Met is a representative receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) present on cell surface. c-Met binds to its ligand, HGF/SF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scattering Factor), to promote intracellular signal transduction, thereby stimulating cell growth, and it is overexpressed in many cancer cells, thereby widely relating to cancer occurrence, cancer metastasis, cancer cell migration, cancer cell invasion, and angiogenesis. In addition, c-Met a representative early protein of cancer metastasis, because c-Met signaling through HGF/SF weakens cell-cell contact in almost all types of epithelial tumors, leading to scattering. (Nat Rev Cancer. 2012 Jan. 24; 12(2):89-103). In particular, hypoxia-response elements are present at the upstream of c-Met gene, and the expression of the gene is increased under oxygen deficiency condition (Oral Oncol. 2006 July; 42(6):593-8). 
 Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of Ang2 and c-Met may lead to more effective inhibition of cancer cell growth and metastasis; however, no single therapeutic for simultaneous inhibition is currently available. This invention provides such a therapeutic.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 In one embodiment the invention provides an anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody including (a) an anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and (b) an anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. The bispecific antibody can simultaneously recognize and bind to c-Met and Ang2, and inhibit the functions thereof, thereby exhibiting synergistic anti-cancer effects. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or mechanism of action, it is believed that the bispecific antibody simultaneously recognizing c-Met and Ang2 can block a signal transduction by c-Met in a cancer cell, thereby preventing the generation of a drug resistance in a subject, and thus, it can exhibit an excellent cancer cell inhibitory effect even in a cancer cell having a drug resistance. 
 As used herein, the term “antibody” refers to all substances generated by antigen stimulation of an immune system, which may be produced naturally (e.g., in a living body) or artificially (e.g., by any recombinant or synthetic event), and has no specific limitation in its type. The antibody may include animal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, or human antibodies. In addition, the antibody may cover any antigen-binding fragment possessing antigen binding capacity. 
 “c-Met” or “c-Met protein”, a target of a bispecific antibody to be provided in one embodiment, refers to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) which binds hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). c-Met may be derived (obtained) from any species, particularly a mammal, for instance, primates such as human c-Met (e.g., NP_000236), monkey c-Met (e.g.,  Macaca mulatta , NP_001162100), or rodents such as mouse c-Met (e.g., NP_032617.2), rat c-Met (e.g., NP_113705.1), or the like. The c-Met protein may include a polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence identified as GenBank Accession Number NM_000245, a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence identified as GenBank Accession Number NP_000236 or extracellular domains thereof. The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met participates in various biological processes, such as cancer incidence, metastasis, migration of cancer cell, invasion of cancer cell, angiogenesis, and the like. 
 Ang2, another target of a bispecific antibody to be provided in one embodiment, is closely related to angiogenesis. It is a soluble ligand present in blood, and it is widely involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, and cancer cell invasion. The Ang2 may be derived (obtained) from, but not limited to, mammals including primates such as humans and monkeys and rodents such as rats and mice and for example, it may be a human Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession #O15123), a monkey Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession No. Q8MIK6 etc.), a mouse Ang2 (NCBI Accession # NP_031452, Accession #O35608, etc.), a rat Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession No. O35462, etc.), and any combination thereof. 
 The anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof is characterized in that the antibody specifically binds to Ang2 but does not inhibit binding between Ang2 and Tie2 receptor, and forms a complex (antibody/Ang2/Tie2 complex) by binding to Tie2 receptor via Ang2. The anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof has ability to dimerize; through dimerization, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof can induce the activation of the Tie2 receptor and its downstream signaling by effectively clustering the Tie2 receptor in the complex. By virtue of this mechanism, the antibody and the antigen-binding fragment thereof inhibits Ang2 function by binding to Ang2 to induce the intracellular internalization and degradation thereof, and thus lowers the level of circulating Ang2. At the same time, it induces Tie2 downstream signaling by binding to the Tie2 receptor via Ang2 to activate the Tie2 receptor, like Ang1, and induces the stabilization of vascular endothelial cells. By having such dual functions, the antibody and the antigen-binding fragment thereof can be usefully employed to treat not only symptoms (disorders) due to the overexpression of Ang2 but also symptoms (disorders) due to the decrease in the stabilization of vascular endothelial cells, that is, the increase of vascular penetration. 
 Thus, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof is a therapeutic antibody targeting an angiogenesis-inducing factor, Ang2, which not only inhibits the functions of Ang2 by specifically binding to Ang2 but also induces the activation of Tie2 by allowing Ang2 to bind Tie2 receptor. The anti-Ang2 antibody may bind Ang2 in such a way that Ang2 may still bind with Tie2. The anti-Ang2 antibody may not directly bind to Tie2 receptor, but it can form a complex with Tie2 by binding Ang2 which, in turn, binds Tie2 receptor. The anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof has the effect of treating disease by binding to a Tie2 receptor together with Ang2 to activate the Tie2 receptor and thus induce the structural/functional normalization of blood vessels, along with the down-regulation of Ang2, wherein the disease may any one related to the dysfunction and/or the abnormal activation of blood vessels including cancer, sepsis, eye disorders, and the like. 
 One embodiment provides an anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, specifically binding to (recognizing) an angiogenesis-inducing factor Ang2 (Angiopoietin-2) and binding to a Tie2 receptor together with Ang2 (e.g., via Ang2). Thus, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may specifically recognize and/or bind to Ang2 and bind to Tie2 receptor via Ang2. Also, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may induce the activation of the Tie2 receptor. Such activation of Tie2 receptor may be induced by an increase in the phosphorylation of Tie2 receptor and/or the phosphorylation of proteins related to the downstream signal pathway thereof, for example, at least one selected from the group consisting of Akt (e.g., encoded by NM_005163), eNOS (e.g., encoded by NM_000603), 42/44 (e.g., encoded by NM_002745), etc. Also, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may induce the intracellular internalization of a Tie2 receptor. In other words, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may bind to Ang2 and the Tie2 receptor via Ang2 to form a complex (antibody/Ang2/Tie2) and induce the activation of the Tie2 receptor, by not inhibiting binding between Ang2 and the Tie2 receptor while specifically binding to Ang2, unlike the pre-existing anti-Ang2 antibodies. Therefore, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may increase the phosphorylation of a protein related to the downstream signal pathway of Tie2 receptor, such as at least one selected from the group consisting of Akt, eNOS, and 42/44, compared to the case using (treating) no antibody or any anti-Ang2 antibody inhibiting the binding between Ang2 and Tie2 receptor, such as antibody 4H10 (SEQ ID NO: 120 (heavy chain variable region) & 121 (light chain variable region)), RG antibody (Regeneron Co.), etc. 
 The Ang2 protein, which functions as an antigen for the anti-Ang2 antibody or antibody fragment is a soluble ligand present in blood and widely involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, cancer cell invasion, etc. Ang2 may be from mammals including primates such as humans and monkeys and rodents such as rats and mice and for example, it may be human Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession No. O15123, etc.), monkey Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession No. Q8MIK6, etc.), mouse Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession No. O35608, etc.), and rat Ang2 (e.g., NCBI Accession No. O35462, etc.), but is not limited thereto. 
 The Tie2 receptor (TEK tyrosine kinase), which is an Angiopoietin-1 receptor, is expressed in vascular endothelial cells in various mammals, such as mouse (NM_013690; NP_038718), rat, and human (NM_000459; NP_000450), and is involved in various downstream signaling. 
 The anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may recognize (specifically bind) all or part of  loop  1 of human Ang2 (hAng2; SEQ ID NO: 119; Accession #O15123). For example, the antibody or antibody fragment may specifically bind at least one amino acid residue at a site exposed to the outside of  loop  1 of hAng2 (e.g., in SEQ ID NO: 119, a site from the 417 th  amino acid to the 434 th  amino acid) of human Ang2 or an amino acid sequence including about 2 to about 20, about 2 to about 15, about 2 to about 10, or about 2 to about 5 contiguous amino acids including at least one amino acid residue exposed to the outside of  loop  1 of SEQ ID NO: 119 as an epitope.

 For example, the anti-Ang2 antibody may recognize Q418, P419, a combination of Q418 and P419 positioned at  loop  1 of SEQ ID NO: 119, or an amino acid sequence site including about 2 to about 20, about 2 to about 15, about 2 to about 10, or about 2 to about 5 contiguous amino acids including the amino acid residue of Q418, P419, or combination of Q418 and P419 of SEQ ID NO: 119, as an epitope, or specifically bind to this site. In one embodiment, the anti-Ang2 antibody may recognize the amino acid residues of Q418 and P419 of SEQ ID NO: 119 as an epitope, or specifically bind to this portion. 
 Q418, P419, or an amino acid region including these residues, to which the anti-Ang2 antibody specifically binds, is an exposed amino acid region positioned at  loop  1 of the three dimensional structure of Ang2, and it is considered to directly participate in binding between Ang2 and Tie2 receptor or to be a site regulating it. 
 In Q418, P419, or an amino acid region including them, to which the anti-Ang2 antibody specifically binds, the term “contiguous amino acids” may refer to amino acids which are adjacent to one another on the primary, secondary, or tertiary structure of a protein (i.e., Ang2). 
 Also provided is an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof which competes with the above-described anti-Ang2 antibody for binding, and can inhibit Ang2 and at the same time form a complex with Ang2 and Tie2 receptor (i.e., by binding of antibody-Ang2 to the Tie2 receptor) to activate Tie2. This competitively-binding antibody may be an antibody recognizing a site adjacent to the aforementioned site on its three dimensional structure as an epitope and/or a specific binding site. The competitively-binding antibody may have a binding affinity with Ang2 of 0.1 pM to 50 nM, for example, 1 pM to 30 nM, 2 pM to 20 nM or 1 nM to 10 nM. 
 Therefore, the competitively-binding anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may be an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binding a site contiguous to the aforementioned epitope. 
 In a specific embodiment, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise or consist essentially of: 
 at least one heavy chain complementarity determining region (CDR) selected from the group consisting of a polypeptide (CDR-H1) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 109, a polypeptide (CDR-H2) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 110, and a polypeptide (CDR-H3) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 111, or a heavy chain variable region comprising the at least one heavy chain complementarity determining region; 
 at least one light chain complementarity determining region selected from the group consisting of a polypeptide (CDR-L1) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 112, a polypeptide (CDR-L2) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 113, and a polypeptide (CDR-L3) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 114, or a light chain variable region comprising the at least one light chain complementarity determining region; 
 a combination of said at least one heavy chain complementarity determining region and said at least one light chain complementarity determining region; or 
 a combination of the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region. 
 More particularly, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise or consist essentially of: 
 a heavy chain variable region comprising a polypeptide (CDR-H1) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 109, a polypeptide (CDR-H2) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 110, and a polypeptide (CDR-H3) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 111; and 
 a light chain variable region comprising a polypeptide (CDR-L1) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 112, a polypeptide (CDR-L2) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 113, and a polypeptide (CDR-L3) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 114.

 In an embodiment, a heavy chain variable region of the humanized anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise or consist essentially of: 
 a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 132 to 136, for example, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 133 to 136, as a framework region adjacent to N-terminus of CDR-H1, 
 a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 137 to 141, for example, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 138 to 141, as a framework region between CDR-H1 and CDR-H2,

 A light chain variable region of the humanized anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise or consist essentially of: 
 a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 152 or 153, for example, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 153, as a framework region adjacent to N-terminus of CDR-L1, 
 a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 154 or 155, for example, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 155, as a framework region between CDR-L1 and CDR-L2, 
 a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 156 or 157, for example, an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 157, as a framework region between CDR-L2 and CDR-L3, and

 In one embodiment, the anti-Ang2 antibody or antibody fragment does not comprise a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 132 as a framework region adjacent to N-terminus of CDR-H1, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 137 as a framework region between CDR-H1 and CDR-H2, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 142 as a framework region between CDR-H2 and CDR-H3, and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 147 as a framework region adjacent to C-terminus of CDR-H3; and/or a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 152 as a framework region adjacent to N-terminus of CDR-L1, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 154 as a framework region between CDR-L1 and CDR-L2, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 156 as a framework region between CDR-L2 and CDR-L3, and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 158 as a framework region adjacent to C-terminus of CDR-L3. 
 In an embodiment, the humanized anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise a heavy chain variable region comprising or consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 160, SEQ ID NO: 161, SEQ ID NO: 162, SEQ ID NO: 163, or SEQ ID NO:164, a light chain variable region comprising or consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 165, SEQ ID NO: 166, SEQ ID NO: 167, SEQ ID NO: 168, SEQ ID NO: 169, SEQ ID NO: 170, or SEQ ID NO: 171, or any combination thereof. 
 The anti-c-Met antibody may recognize a specific region of c-Met, e.g., a specific region in the SEMA domain, as an epitope. It may be any antibody or antigen-binding fragment that acts on c-Met to induce intracellular internalization and degradation of c-Met. 
 c-Met, a receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), may be divided into three portions: extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular. The extracellular portion is composed of an α-subunit and a β-subunit which are linked to each other through a disulfide bond, and includes a SEMA domain responsible for binding HGF, a plexin-semaphorins-integrin identity/homology domain (PSI domain) and an immunoglobulin-like fold shared by plexins and transcriptional factors domain (IPT domain). The SEMA domain of c-Met protein may have the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 79, and is an extracellular domain that functions to bind HGF. A specific region of the SEMA domain, that is, a region having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 71, which corresponds to a range from amino acid residues 106 to 124 of the amino acid sequence of the SEMA domain (SEQ ID NO: 79), is a loop region between the second and the third beta propellers within the epitopes of the SEMA domain. This region acts as an epitope for the anti-c-Met antibody provided in the present description. 
 The term “epitope,” as used herein, refers to an antigenic determinant, a part of an antigen recognized by an antibody. In one embodiment, the epitope may be a region including 5 or more contiguous (consecutive on primary, secondary (two-dimensional), or tertiary (three-dimensional) structure) amino acid residues within the SEMA domain (SEQ ID NO: 79) of c-Met protein, for instance, 5 to 19 contiguous amino acid residues within the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 71. For example, the epitope may be a polypeptide having 5 to 19 contiguous amino acids selected from among partial combinations of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 71, wherein the polypeptide includes the amino sequence of SEQ ID NO: 73 (EEPSQ) serving as an essential element for the epitope. For example, the epitope may be a polypeptide including, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 71, SEQ ID NO: 72, or SEQ ID NO: 73. 
 The epitope having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 72 corresponds to the outermost part of the loop between the second and third beta propellers within the SEMA domain of a c-Met protein. The epitope having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 73 is a site to which the antibody or antigen-binding fragment according to one embodiment most specifically binds. 
 Thus, the anti-c-Met antibody may specifically bind to an epitope which includes 5 to 19 contiguous amino acids selected from among partial combinations of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 71, including SEQ ID NO: 73 as an essential element. For example, the anti-c-Met antibody may specifically bind to an epitope including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 71, SEQ ID NO: 72, or SEQ ID NO: 73. 
 In one embodiment, the anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may comprise or consist essentially of: 
 at least one heavy chain complementarity determining region (CDR) selected from the group consisting of (a) a CDR-H1 including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4; (b) a CDR-H2 including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 2, or an amino acid sequence including 8-19 consecutive amino acids within SEQ ID NO: 2 including amino acid residues from the 3 rd  to 10 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 2; and (c) a CDR-H3 including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 85, or an amino acid sequence including 6-13 consecutive amino acids within SEQ ID NO: 85 including amino acid residues from the 1 st  to 6 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 85, or a heavy chain variable region including the at least one heavy chain complementarity determining region; 
 at least one light chain complementarity determining region (CDR) selected from the group consisting of (a) a CDR-L1 including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, (b) a CDR-L2 including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8, and (c) a CDR-L3 including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 86, or an amino acid sequence including 9-17 consecutive amino acids within SEQ ID NO: 89 including amino acid residues from the 1 st  to 9 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 89, or a light chain variable region including the at least one light chain complementarity determining region; 
 a combination of the at least one heavy chain complementarity determining region and at least one light chain complementarity determining region; or 
 a combination of the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region.

For example, the antibody may include a hinge region having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 100 (U7-HC6), SEQ ID NO: 101 (U6-HC7), SEQ ID NO: 102 (U3-HC9), SEQ ID NO: 103 (U6-HC8), or SEQ ID NO: 104 (U8-HC5), or a hinge region having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 105 (non-modified human hinge). In particular, the hinge region includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 100 or SEQ ID NO: 101. 
 In one embodiment, the anti-c-Met antibody or antigen-binding fragment may comprise a heavy chain variable region comprising or consisting essentially of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 74, SEQ ID NO: 87, SEQ ID NO: 90, SEQ ID NO: 91, SEQ ID NO: 92, SEQ ID NO: 93, or SEQ ID NO: 94; a light chain variable region comprising or consisting essentially of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 196, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 75, SEQ ID NO: 88, SEQ ID NO: 95, SEQ ID NO: 96, SEQ ID NO: 97, SEQ ID NO: 98, SEQ ID NO: 99, or SEQ ID NO: 107; or a combination of the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region. 
 In one embodiment, the anti-c-Met antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody may be produced by the hybridoma cell line deposited with the Korean Cell Line Research Foundation, an international depository authority located at Yungun-Dong, Jongno-Gu, Seoul, Korea, on Oct. 6, 2009, under Accession No. KCLRF-BP-00220, which binds specifically to the extracellular region of c-Met protein (refer to Korean Patent Publication No. 2011-0047698, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference). The anti-c-Met antibody may include any of the antibodies described in Korean Patent Publication No. 2011-0047698. 
 By way of further example, the anti-c-Met antibody or the antibody fragment may comprise or consist essentially of: 
 a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62 (wherein the amino acid sequence from amino acid residues from the 1 st  to 17 th  positions is a signal peptide), or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 462 nd  positions of SEQ ID NO: 62, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64 (wherein the amino acid sequence from the 1 st  to 17 th  positions is a signal peptide), the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 461 st  positions of SEQ ID NO: 64, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 66 (wherein the amino acid sequence from the 1 st  to 17 th  positions is a signal peptide), and the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 460 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 66; and 
 a light chain including the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 (wherein the amino acid sequence from the 1 st  to 20 th  positions is a signal peptide), the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 68, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70 (wherein the amino acid sequence from the 1 st  to 20 th  positions is a signal peptide), the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 70, and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 108. 
 For example, the anti-c-Met antibody may be selected from the group consisting of: 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 462 nd  positions of SEQ ID NO: 62 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 or the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 68; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 461 st  positions of SEQ ID NO: 64 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 or the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 68; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 66 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 460 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 66 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 or the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 68; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 462 nd  positions of SEQ ID NO: 62 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70 or the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 70; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 461 st  positions of SEQ ID NO: 64 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70 or the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 70; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 66 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 460 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 66 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70 or the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 70; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 462 nd  positions of SEQ ID NO: 62 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 108; 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 461 st  positions of SEQ ID NO: 64 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 108; and 
 an antibody including a heavy chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 66 or the amino acid sequence from the 18 th  to 460 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 66 and a light chain including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 108. 
 The polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 70 is a light chain including human kappa (κ) constant region, and the polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 is a polypeptide obtained by replacing histidine at position 62 (corresponding to position 36 of SEQ ID NO: 68 according to kabat numbering) of the polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70 with tyrosine. The production yield of the antibodies may be increased by the replacement. The polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 108 is a polypeptide obtained by replacing serine at position 32 (position 27e according to kabat numbering in the amino acid sequence from amino acid residues 21 to 240 of SEQ ID NO: 68; positioned within CDR-L1) with tryptophan. By such replacement, antibodies and antibody fragments including such sequences exhibits increased activities, such as c-Met biding affinity, c-Met degradation activity, Akt phosphorylation inhibition, and the like. 
 The following descriptions may be applied to both the anti-c-Met antibodies or fragments thereof and the anti-Ang2 antibodies or fragments thereof described herein. 
 In the anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, the portion of the light chain and the heavy chain portion, other than the CDRs, the light chain variable region, and the heavy chain variable region as defined above, for example, the light chain constant region and the heavy chain constant region, may be those from any subtype of immunoglobulin (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgM, etc.). 
 Animal-derived antibodies produced by immunizing non-immune animals with a desired antigen generally invoke immunogenicity when injected to humans for the purpose of medical treatment, and thus chimeric antibodies have been developed to inhibit such immunogenicity. Chimeric antibodies are prepared by replacing constant regions of animal-derived antibodies that cause an anti-isotype response with constant regions of human antibodies by genetic engineering. Chimeric antibodies are considerably improved in an anti-isotype response compared to animal-derived antibodies, but animal-derived amino acids still have variable regions, so that chimeric antibodies have side effects with respect to a potential anti-idiotype response. Humanized antibodies have been developed to reduce such side effects. Humanized antibodies are produced by grafting complementarity determining regions (CDR) which serve an important role in antigen binding in variable regions of chimeric antibodies into a human antibody framework. 
 The most important thing in CDR grafting to produce humanized antibodies is choosing the optimized human antibodies for accepting CDRs of animal-derived antibodies. Antibody databases, analysis of a crystal structure, and technology for molecule modeling are used. However, even when the CDRs of animal-derived antibodies are grafted to the most optimized human antibody framework, amino acids positioned in a framework of the animal-derived CDRs affecting antigen binding are present. Therefore, in many cases, antigen binding affinity is not maintained, and thus application of additional antibody engineering technology for recovering the antigen binding affinity is necessary. 
 The anti c-Met antibodies and the anti-Ang2 antibodies may be animal antibodies (e.g., mouse-derived antibodies), chimeric antibodies (e.g., mouse-human chimeric antibodies), humanized antibodies, or human antibodies. The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be isolated from a living body or non-naturally occurring. The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof may be synthetic or recombinant. The antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. 
 An intact antibody includes two full-length light chains and two full-length heavy chains, in which each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by disulfide bonds. The antibody has a heavy chain constant region and a light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is of a gamma (γ), mu (μ), alpha (α), delta (δ), or epsilon (ε) type, which may be further categorized as gamma 1 (γ1), gamma 2 (γ2), gamma 3 (γ3), gamma 4 (γ4), alpha 1 (α1), or alpha 2 (α2). The light chain constant region is of either a kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) type. 
 As used herein, the term “heavy chain” refers to full-length heavy chain, and fragments thereof, including a variable region V H  that includes amino acid sequences sufficient to provide specificity to antigens, and three constant regions, C H1 , C H2 , and C H3 , and a hinge. The term “light chain” refers to a full-length light chain and fragments thereof, including a variable region V L  that includes amino acid sequences sufficient to provide specificity to antigens, and a constant region C L . 
 The term “complementarity determining region (CDR)” refers to a part of a variable region of an antibody, which allows a binding specificity to a specific antigen and an amino acid sequence found in a hyper variable region of a heavy chain or a light chain of immunoglobulin. The heavy and light chains may respectively include three CDRs (CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3; and CDRL1, CDRL2, and CDRL3). The CDR may provide contact residues that play an important role in the binding of antibodies to antigens or epitopes. The terms “specifically binding” and “specifically recognized” are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and indicate that an antibody and an antigen specifically interact with each other to lead to an immunological activity. 
 The term “antigen-binding fragment” used herein refers to fragments of an intact immunoglobulin including portions of a polypeptide including antigen-binding regions (e.g., at least one CDR) having the ability to specifically bind to the antigen. In a particular embodiment, the antigen-binding fragment may be scFv, (scFv) 2 , scFvFc, Fab, Fab′, or F(ab′) 2 , but is not limited thereto. 
 Among the antigen-binding fragments, Fab that includes light chain and heavy chain variable regions, a light chain constant region, and a first heavy chain constant region C H1 , has one antigen-binding site. 
 The Fab′ fragment is different from the Fab fragment, in that Fab′ includes a hinge region with at least one cysteine residue at the C-terminal of C H1 . 
 The F(ab′) 2  antibody is formed through disulfide bridging of the cysteine residues in the hinge region of the Fab′ fragment. 
 Fv is the smallest antibody fragment with only a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region. Recombination techniques of generating the Fv fragment are widely known in the art. 
 Two-chain Fv includes a heavy chain variable region and a light chain region which are linked by a non-covalent bond. Single-chain Fv generally includes a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region which are linked by a covalent bond via a peptide linker or linked at the C-terminals to have a dimer structure like the two-chain Fv. The peptide linker may be the same as described in the above, for example, those including the amino acid length of about 1 to about 100, about 2 to about 50, particularly about 5 to about 25, and any kinds of amino acids may be included without any restrictions. 
 The antigen-binding fragments may be attainable using protease (for example, the Fab fragment may be obtained by restricted cleavage of a whole antibody with papain, and the F(ab′) 2  fragment may be obtained by cleavage with pepsin), or may be prepared by using a genetic recombination technique. 
 The term “hinge region,” as used herein, refers to a region between CH1 and CH2 domains within the heavy chain of an antibody which functions to provide flexibility for the antigen-binding site. 
 When an animal antibody undergoes a chimerization process, the IgG1 hinge of animal origin is replaced with a human IgG1 hinge or IgG2 hinge while the disulfide bridges between two heavy chains are reduced from three to two in number. In addition, an animal-derived IgG1 hinge is shorter than a human IgG1 hinge. Accordingly, the rigidity of the hinge is changed. Thus, a modification of the hinge region may bring about an improvement in the antigen binding efficiency of the humanized antibody. The modification of the hinge region through amino acid deletion, addition, or substitution is well-known to those skilled in the art. 
 The antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody may be prepared by methods well known in the art. For example, it may be prepared using a phage display technique. 
 Meanwhile, individual monoclonal antibodies may be screened using a typical ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) format, based on the binding potential with Ang2 or c-Met. Inhibitory activities can be verified through functional analysis such as competitive ELISA for verifying the molecular interaction of binding assemblies or functional analysis such as a cell-based assay. Then, with regard to monoclonal antibody members selected on the basis of their strong inhibitory activities, their affinities (Kd values) to Ang2 or c-Met may be each verified. 
 In an embodiment, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may include an anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, and an anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, wherein the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof is linked to C-terminus or N-terminus, e.g., C-terminus, of the anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. 
 In the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody, in order to fully perform the anti-c-Met antibody's activity to mediate intracellular migration and degradation of c-Met proteins, it may be advantageous that the anti-c-Met antibody has its own intact antibody structure. In addition, in case of the anti-Ang2 antibody, its specific recognition and binding to Ang2 is important, and thus it will be fine that just an antigen-binding fragment recognizing Ang2 is included in the bispecific antibody. Therefore, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may comprise a complete anti-c-Met antibody (e.g., IgG type antibody) and an antigen binding fragment (e.g., scFv or scFv-Fc) of the anti-Ang2 antibody linked to the C terminus of the anti-c-Met antibody (e.g., the C terminus a heavy chain), but not be limited thereto. In this case, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may comprise a first polypeptide (corresponding to a heavy chain of the bispecific antibody) comprising a heavy chain of an anti-c-Met antibody and an antigen binding fragment (e.g., scFv or scFv-Fc) of the anti-Ang2 antibody linked to the C terminus of the heavy chain of the anti-c-Met antibody (optionally, via a peptide linker described below), and a second polypeptide (corresponding to a light chain of the bispecific antibody) comprising a light chain of the anti-c-Met antibody. 
 In the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody, the anti-c-Met antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof, and the anti-Ang2 antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof, may be linked via a peptide linker. Furthermore, a heavy chain portion and a light chain portion within the antigen binding fragment, for example, a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region within the scFv fragment, may be linked via a peptide linker. The peptide linker which links the anti-c-Met antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof, and the anti-Ang2 antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof, and the peptide linker which links the heavy chain portion and the light chain portion within the antigen binding fragment may be identical or different. The peptide linker may be about 1 to about 100, particularly about 2 to about 50, amino acids in length and include any kinds of amino acids. The peptide linker may include for example, Gly, Asn and/or Ser residues, and also include neutral amino acids such as Thr and/or Ala. Amino acid sequences suitable for the peptide linker are known in the relevant art. The length of the peptide linker may be determined within such a limit that the functions of the fusion protein (bispecific antibody) will not be affected. For instance, the peptide linker may be formed by including a total of about 1 to about 100, about 2 to about 50, or about 5 to about 25 of one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of Gly, Asn, Ser, Thr, and Ala. In one embodiment, the peptide linker may be represented as ((GGGGS) (SEQ ID NO: 197))n, wherein n is a repeat number of (GGGGS) (SEQ ID NO: 197), which is an integer of about 1 to about 10, particularly an integer of about 2 to about 5. 
 In a particular embodiment, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may include an anti-c-Met antibody, and an scFv, scFv-Fc, (scFv) 2 , Fab, Fab′ or F(ab′) 2 , for example, scFv, of an anti-Ang2 antibody linked to the C terminus of the anti-c-Met antibody. For instance, scFv, scFv-Fc, (scFv) 2 , Fab, Fab′ or F(ab′) 2  of the anti-Ang2 antibody may include a heavy chain variable region including the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO: 160, SEQ ID NO: 161, SEQ ID NO: 162, SEQ ID NO: 163, and SEQ ID NO: 164, and a light chain variable region including the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO: 165, SEQ ID NO: 166, SEQ ID NO: 167, SEQ ID NO: 168, SEQ ID NO: 169, SEQ ID NO: 170, and SEQ ID NO: 171. 
 Hence, in a particular embodiment, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may include an anti-c-Met antibody, and an scFv, scFv-Fc, (scFv) 2 , Fab, Fab′ or F(ab′) 2  of an anti-Ang2 antibody including a heavy chain variable region including the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO: 160 to SEQ ID NO: 164, and a light chain variable region the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO: 165 to SEQ ID NO: 171, which is linked to the C terminal of the anti-c-Met antibody. 
 In an embodiment, the heavy chain of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may comprise a heavy chain of an anti-c-Met antibody at N-terminal portion, and an scFv, (scFv) 2 , scFv-Fc, Fab, Fab′ or F(ab′) 2  of an anti-Ang2 antibody at C-terminal portion, which are linked to each other directly (i.e., through no linker) or indirectly (i.e., through a linker), and for example, comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 194. 
 The light chain of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may be the same with that of the above described anti-c-Met antibody, and for example, light chain may include an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 (wherein the amino acid sequence from the 1 st  to 20 th  positions is a signal peptide), the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70 (wherein the amino acid sequence from the 1 st  to 20 th  positions is a signal peptide), the amino acid sequence from the 21 st  to 240 th  positions of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70, and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 108. 
 Due to internalization and degradation activities of the anti-c-Met antibody, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody is capable of not only inhibiting the activities of c-Met and Ang2, but also decreasing the total amount of c-Met and Ang2 by degrading them, thereby leading to more fundamental blocking of activity of the c-Met and Ang2. Therefore, the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody can exhibit therapeutic effects even when it is applied to a subject who has a resistance against a preexisting Ang2-targeting drug, such as an anti-Ang2, or an anti-c-Met antibody. 
 As described above, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds to Ang2, and does not inhibit but induces the binding of Ang2 and Tie2 receptor. In addition, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof binds to Ang2, to form an anti-Ang2 antibody/Ang2 conjugate. The conjugate acts as Ang1, that is, binds to Tie2 receptor (wherein Ang2 part of the conjugate participates in the binding), and leads to Tie2 receptor activation. In particular, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof inhibits the functions of Ang2, thereby inhibiting an abnormal angiogenesis, and thus, it can be applicable to prevent, alleviate, improve, and/or treat various diseases (e.g., cancer) related to abnormal angiogenesis. In addition, since the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof does not inhibit the binding between Ang2 and Tie2, it can activate Tie2 receptor, thereby activating a Tie2 signaling, and it can accelerate the formation of vascular endothelium or lymphatic endothelium and increase mobility, thereby suppressing vascular permeability increase. Therefore, it can be applicable to prevent, alleviate, improve, and/or treat various diseases related to vascular permeability (for example, sepsis, eye disorders, etc.). Moreover, since the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof accelerates the formation of vascular endothelium or lymphatic endothelium to increase the formation of healthy blood vessels and normalize the blood vessels, it can be also applicable to prevent, alleviate, improve, and/or treat various diseases or symptoms requiring the formation of healthy blood vessels, such as wound healing or ischemic disorders. Also, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof reduces cancer growth and metastasis possibly by changing the abnormally formed cancer blood vessels into structurally and functionally normal forms. In addition, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof has an effect of suppressing inflammatory response, whereby it is applicable to prevent, alleviate, improve, and/or treat various inflammatory disorders. In addition, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof has an effect of vascular normalization, thereby increasing transporting efficiency of an anticancer agent into cancer tissues through the normalized blood vessel and increasing sensitivity to the anticancer agent. Therefore, the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof can be applicable as an adjuvant to be co-administered with an anticancer agent for enhancing the efficacy of the anticancer agent. The adjuvant may refer to a supplementary pharmaceutical composition used for enhancing the efficacy of an anticancer agent.

 Since the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof comprised in the active ingredient of the pharmaceutical composition, i.e., the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody, can be further activated by binding to Ang2, the pharmaceutical composition may also comprise Ang2 in addition to the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody, to increase the function of the anti-Ang2 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. In addition, the method may further comprise a step of administering Ang2 to the subject, for example, in a pharmaceutically effective amount, simultaneously with the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody or sequentially in any order. 
 In addition, the pharmaceutical composition or the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may be administered as an individual drug, or together with other drugs, and may be administered sequentially or simultaneously with pre-existing drugs. 
 In particular, the pharmaceutical composition including an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may be formulated into an immunoliposome since it contains an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment. A liposome containing an antibody may be prepared using any methods widely known in the art. The immunoliposome may be a lipid composition including phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and polyethyleneglycol-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine, and may be prepared by a reverse phase evaporation method. For example, Fab′ fragments of an antibody may be conjugated to the liposome through a disulfide-exchange reaction. 
 The subject to whom the pharmaceutical composition of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody is administered may be mammals, for example, primates such as humans and monkeys, or rodents such as rats and mice, or a cell or a tissue isolated from the mammal or a culture thereof, but are not be limited thereto. The subject may be a cancer patient having resistance against pre-existing anticancer drugs, for example, antagonists (e.g., an antibody) against a cancer-related target (e.g., c-Met, Ang2, etc.). 
 The anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 antibody possesses both characteristics as an inhibitor against Ang2/Tie2 signal transduction and c-Met/HGF signal transduction, and may exhibit the following effects of: 
 1. Increasing the therapeutic efficacy compared to administration of Ang2/Tie2 inhibitor alone, HGF/c-Met inhibitor alone, or a combination thereof, thereby decreasing the administration amount thereof. 
 2. having an effect of inhibiting cancer metastasis as well as an effect of inhibiting cancer cell growth. 
 3. exhibiting an anticancer effect even on a cancer having a resistance to a pre-exiting anti-c-Met antibody and/or anti-Ang2 antibody. 
 4. being capable of being applied to a disease associated with Ang2/Tie2 signal transduction and HGF/c-Met signal transduction, other than cancers. 
 Also provided herein is a nucleic acid encoding the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody described herein, optionally in a vector. The nucleic acid or vector can be in a cell. 
 The term “vector” used herein refers to a means for expressing a target gene in a host cell. For example, it includes a plasmid vector, a cosmid vector, and a virus vector such as a bacteriophage vector, an adenovirus vector, a retrovirus vector and an adeno-associated virus vector. Suitable recombinant vectors may be constructed by manipulating plasmids often used in the art (for example, pSC101, pGV1106, pACYC177, ColE1, pKT230, pME290, pBR322, pUC8/9, pUC6, pBD9, pHC79, pIJ61, pLAFR1, pHV14, pGEX series, pET series, and pUC19), a phage (for example, λgt4λB, λ-Charon, λΔz1, and M13), or a virus (for example, SV40). 
 The recombinant vector including the nucleic acid encoding the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody may include the polynucleotides encoding the protein complex and an expression regulating factor (sequence) such as promoter, which are operatively linked to each other. The term “operatively linked” used herein refers to a functional linkage between a nucleotide expression regulating sequence (for example, a promoter sequence) and other nucleotide sequences. Thus, the expression regulating sequence may regulate the transcription and/or translation of the other nucleotide sequences by being operatively linked. 
 The recombinant (or expression) vector may be constructed typically for either cloning or expression. The recombinant vector may be made from any vector known in the pertinent art for expressing an exogenous protein in plants, animals, or microorganisms. The recombinant vector may be constructed using various methods generally known in the art. 
 The recombinant vector may be transformed or transfected into s host cell, such as, a prokaryotic cell or a eukaryotic cell. For example, when a prokaryotic cell is used as a host cell, the recombinant vector used generally includes a strong promoter capable of initiating transcription (for example, pL λ  promoter, CMV promoter, trp promoter, lac promoter, tac promoter, T7 promoter, etc.), a ribosome binding site for initiating translation, and a transcription/translation termination sequence. When a eukaryotic cell is used as a host cell, the vector used generally includes the origin of replication acting in the eukaryotic cell, for example, a f1 replication origin, a SV40 replication origin, a pMB1 replication origin, an adeno replication origin, an AAV replication origin, or a BBV replication origin, but is not limited thereto. A promoter in an expression vector for a eukaryotic host cell may be a promoter derived from the genomes of mammalian cells (for example, a metallothionein promoter) or a promoter derived from mammalian viruses (for example, an adenovirus late promoter, a vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter, a SV40 promoter, a cytomegalovirus promoter, and a tk promoter of HSV). A transcription termination sequence in an expression vector for a eukaryotic host cell may be, in general, a polyadenylation sequence. 
 A recombinant cell may obtained by transfecting (or transforming) the recombinant vector into a suitable host cell. Any host cells known in the pertinent art that enable stable and continuous cloning or expression of the recombinant vector may be used as the hose cell. Suitable prokaryotic host cells may include  E. coli  JM109,  E. coli  BL21,  E. coli  RR1,  E. coli  LE392,  E. coli  B,  E. coli  X 1776,  E. coli  W3110,  Bacillus  species strains such as  Bacillus subtillis  or  Bacillus thuringiensis , intestinal bacteria and strains such as  Salmonella typhymurum, Serratia marcescens , and various  Pseudomonas  species. Suitable eukaryotic host cells to be transformed may include yeasts, such as  Saccharomyce cerevisiae , insect cells, plant cells, and animal cells, for example, Sp2/0, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1, CHO, CHO-s, HEK293, HEK293f, DG44, PER.C6, W138, BHK, COS-7, 293, HepG2, Huh7, 3T3, RIN, and MDCK cell lines, but are not limited thereto. 
 The polynucleotide or the recombinant vector including the same may be transferred (transfected or transformed) into a host cell by using known transfer methods. Suitable transfer methods for prokaryotic host cells may include a method using CaCl 2  and electroporation. Suitable transfer methods for eukaryotic host cells may include microinjection, calcium phosphate precipitation, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection, and gene bombardment, but are not limited thereto. 
 A transformed or transfected host cell may be selected using a phenotype expressed by a selected marker by any methods known in the art. For example, if the selected marker is a gene that is resistant to a specific antibiotic, a transformant may be easily selected by being cultured in a medium including the antibiotic. 
 Further provided is a method of preparing an anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody as described herein by expressing a nucleic acid encoding the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody in a cell. The anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody can be isolated from the cell and purified to any desired degree. The step of expressing a gene may be performed in vitro. The step of expressing a gene may comprise culturing the recombinant cell in a medium for the cell and under conditions allowing expression of the gene in the cell, wherein the medium and conditions can be any known in the art for similar purposes. In addition, the method may further comprise harvesting (obtaining or separating) the polypeptide of interest from the expressing or culturing product, after the step of expressing or culturing. The step of harvesting the polypeptide of interest may be performed by separating the polypeptide from the recombinant cell, a lysate thereof, and/or a culture media (in case the polypeptide is secreted to a medium). The method of producing may further comprise an additional step, such as a step of purification and/or modification, so that the harvested polypeptide can have a desired quality and/or purity. 
 EXAMPLES 
 Hereafter, the present invention will be described in detail by examples. 
 The following examples are intended merely to illustrate the invention and are not construed to restrict the invention. 
 Reference Example 1: Construction of an Anti-c-Met Antibody 
 1.1. Production of “AbF46”, a Mouse Antibody to c-Met 
 1.1.1. Immunization of a Mouse 
 To obtain immunized mice necessary for the development of a hybridoma cell line, each of five BALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Inc.), 4 to 6 weeks old, was intraperitoneally injected with a mixture of 100 μg of human c-Met/Fc fusion protein (R&D Systems) and one volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. Two weeks after the injection, a second intraperitoneal injection was conducted on the same mice with a mixture of 50 μg of human c-Met/Fc protein and one volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. One week after the second immunization, the immune response was finally boosted. Three days later, blood was taken from the tails of the mice and the sera were 1/1000 diluted in PBS and used to examine a titer of antibody to c-Met by ELISA. Mice found to have a sufficient antibody titer were selected for use in the cell fusion process. 
 1.1.2. Cell Fusion and Production of a Hybridoma 
 Three days before cell fusion, BALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Inc.) were immunized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 50 μg of human c-Met/Fc fusion protein and one volume of PBS. The immunized mice were anesthetized before excising the spleen from the left half of the body. The spleen was meshed to separate splenocytes which were then suspended in a culture medium (DMEM, GIBCO, Invitrogen). The cell suspension was centrifuged to recover the cell layer. The splenocytes thus obtained (1×10 8  cells) were mixed with myeloma cells (Sp2/0) (1×10 8  cells), followed by spinning to give a cell pellet. The cell pellet was slowly suspended, treated with 45% polyethylene glycol (PEG) (1 mL) in DMEM for 1 min at 37° C., and supplemented with 1 mL of DMEM. To the cells was added 10 mL of DMEM over 10 min, after which incubation was conducted in a water bath at 37° C. for 5 min. Then the cell volume was adjusted to 50 mL before centrifugation. The cell pellet thus formed was resuspended at a density of 1˜2×10 5  cells/mL in a selection medium (HAT medium) and 0.1 mL of the cell suspension was allocated to each well of 96-well plates which were then incubated at 37° C. in a CO 2  incubator to establish a hybridoma cell population. 
 1.1.3. Selection of Hybridoma Cells Producing Monoclonal Antibodies to c-Met Protein 
 From the hybridoma cell population established in Reference Example 1.1.2, hybridoma cells which showed a specific response to c-Met protein were screened by ELISA using human c-Met/Fc fusion protein and human Fc protein as antigens. 
 Human c-Met/Fc fusion protein was seeded in an amount of 50 μL (2 μg/mL)/well to microtiter plates and allowed to adhere to the surface of each well. The antibody that remained unbound was removed by washing. For use in selecting the antibodies that do not bind c-Met but recognize Fc, human Fc protein was attached to the plate surface in the same manner. 
 The hybridoma cell culture obtained in Reference Example 1.1.2 was added in an amount of 50 μL to each well of the plates and incubated for 1 hour. The cells remaining unreacted were washed out with a sufficient amount of Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST). Goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added to the plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed with a sufficient amount of TBST, followed by reacting the peroxidase with a substrate (OPD). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on an ELISA reader. 
 Hybridoma cell lines which secrete antibodies that specifically and strongly bind to human c-Met but not human Fc were selected repeatedly. From the hybridoma cell lines obtained by repeated selection, a single clone producing a monoclonal antibody was finally separated by limiting dilution. The single clone of the hybridoma cell line producing the monoclonal antibody was deposited with the Korean Cell Line Research Foundation, an international depository authority located at Yungun-Dong, Jongno-Gu, Seoul, Korea, on Oct. 6, 2009, under Accession No. KCLRF-BP-00220 according to the Budapest Treaty (see Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2011-0047698). 
 1.1.4. Production and Purification of a Monoclonal Antibody 
 The hybridoma cell line obtained in Reference Example 1.1.3 was cultured in a serum-free medium, and the monoclonal antibody (AbF46) was produced and purified from the cell culture. 
 First, the hybridoma cells cultured in 50 mL of a medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) were centrifuged and the cell pellet was washed twice or more with 20 mL of PBS to remove the FBS therefrom. Then, the cells were resuspended in 50 mL of DMEM and incubated for 3 days at 37° C. in a CO 2  incubator. 
 After the cells were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at 4° C. before use or immediately used for the separation and purification of the antibody. An AKTA system (GE Healthcare) equipped with an affinity column (Protein G agarose column; Pharmacia, USA) was used to purify the antibody from 50 to 300 mL of the supernatant, followed by concentration with an filter (Amicon). The antibody was stored in PBS before use in the following examples. 
 1.2. Construction of chAbF46, a Chimeric Antibody to c-Met 
 A mouse antibody is apt to elicit immunogenicity in humans. To solve this problem, chAbF46, a chimeric antibody, was constructed from the mouse antibody AbF46 produced in Reference Example 1.1.4 by replacing the constant region, but not the variable region responsible for antibody specificity, with an amino sequence of the human IgG1 antibody. 
 In this regard, a gene was designed to include the nucleotide sequence of “EcoRI-signal sequence-VH-NheI-CH-TGA-XhoI” (SEQ ID NO: 38) for a heavy chain and the nucleotide sequence of “EcoRI-signal sequence-VL-BsiWI-CL-TGA-XhoI” (SEQ ID NO: 39) for a light chain and synthesized. Then, a DNA fragment having the heavy chain nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 38) and a DNA fragment having the light chain nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 39) were digested with EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and XhoI (NEB, R0146S) before cloning into a vector from the pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit enclosed in an OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019, Invitrogen), and a vector from the pcDNA™3.3-TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01), respectively. 
 Each of the constructed vectors was amplified using Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat no. 12662), and a transient expression was performed using Freestyle™ MAX 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). 293 F cells were used for the expression and cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium in a suspension culture manner. At one day before the transient expression, the cells were provided in the concentration of 5×10 5  cells/ml, and after 24 hours, when the cell number reached to 1×10 6  cells/ml, the transient expression was performed. A transfection was performed by a liposomal reagent method using Freestyle™ MAX reagent (Invitrogen), wherein in a 15 ml tube, the DNA was provided in the mixture ratio of 1:1 (heavy chain DNA:light chain DNA) and mixed with 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM (Invitrogen) (A), and in another 15 ml tube, 100 ul (microliter) of Freestyle™ MAX reagent and 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM were mixed (B), followed by mixing (A) and (B) and incubating for 15 minutes. The obtained mixture was slowly mixed with the cells provided one day before the transient expression. After completing the transfection, the cells were incubated in 130 rpm incubator for 5 days under the conditions of 37° C., 80% humidity, and 8% CO 2 . 
 Afterwards, the cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS for 5 hours at 37° C. under a 5% CO 2  condition and then in FBS-free DMEM for 48 hours at 37° C. under a 5% CO 2  condition. 
 After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to AKTA prime (GE Healthcare) to purify the antibody. In this regard, 100 mL of the supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to AKTA Prime equipped with a Protein A column (GE Healthcare, 17-0405-03), followed by elution with an IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004). The buffer was exchanged with PBS to purify a chimeric antibody AbF46 (hereinafter referred to as “chAbF46”). 
 1.3. Construction of Humanized Antibody huAbF46 from Chimeric Antibody chAbF46 
 1.3.1. Heavy Chain Humanization 
 To design two domains H1-heavy and H3-heavy, human germline genes which share the highest identity/homology with the VH gene of the mouse antibody AbF46 purified in Reference Example 1.2 were analyzed. An Ig BLAST (IgBLAST online database tool, maintained by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, Md.) result revealed that VH3-71 has an identity/identity/homology of 83% at the amino acid level. CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of the mouse antibody AbF46 were defined according to Kabat numbering. A design was made to introduce the CDR of the mouse antibody AbF46 into the framework of VH3-71. Hereupon, back mutations to the amino acid sequence of the mouse AbF46 were conducted at positions 30 (S→T), 48 (V→L), 73 (D→N), and 78 (T→L). Then, H1 was further mutated at positions 83 (R→K) and 84 (A→T) to finally establish H1-heavy (SEQ ID NO: 40) and H3-heavy (SEQ ID NO: 41). 
 For use in designing H4-heavy, human antibody frameworks were analyzed by a BLAST search. The result revealed that the VH3 subtype, known to be most stable, is very similar in framework and sequence to the mouse antibody AbF46. CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of the mouse antibody AbF46 were defined according to Kabat numbering and introduced into the VH3 subtype to construct H4-heavy (SEQ ID NO: 42). 
 1.3.2. Light Chain Humanization 
 To design two domains H1-light (SEQ ID NO: 43) and H2-light (SEQ ID NO: 44), human germline genes which share the highest identity/homology with the VH gene of the mouse antibody AbF46 were analyzed. An Ig BLAST search result revealed that VK4-1 has a identity/homology of 75% at the amino acid level. CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of the mouse antibody AbF46 were defined according to Kabat numbering. A design was made to introduce the CDR of the mouse antibody AbF46 into the framework of VK4-1. Hereupon, back mutations to the amino acid sequence of the mouse AbF46 were conducted at positions 36 (Y→H), 46 (L→M), and 49 (Y→I). Only one back mutation was conducted at position 49 (Y→I) on H2-light. 
 To design H3-light (SEQ ID NO: 45), human germline genes which share the highest identity/homology with the VL gene of the mouse antibody AbF46 were analyzed by a BLAST search. As a result, VK2-40 was selected. VL and VK2-40 of the mouse antibody AbF46 were found to have a identity/homology of 61% at an amino acid level. CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of the mouse antibody were defined according to Kabat numbering and introduced into the framework of VK4-1. Back mutations were conducted at positions 36 (Y→H), 46 (L→M), and 49 (Y→I) on H3-light. 
 For use in designing H4-light (SEQ ID NO: 46), human antibody frameworks were analyzed. A Blast search revealed that the Vk1 subtype, known to be the most stable, is very similar in framework and sequence to the mouse antibody AbF46. CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of the mouse antibody AbF46 were defined according to Kabat numbering and introduced into the Vk1 subtype. Hereupon, back mutations were conducted at positions 36 (Y→H), 46 (L→M), and 49 (Y→I) on H4-light. 
 Thereafter, DNA fragments having the heavy chain nucleotide sequences (H1-heavy: SEQ ID NO: 47, H3-heavy: SEQ ID NO: 48, H4-heavy: SEQ ID NO: 49) and DNA fragments having the light chain nucleotide sequences (H1-light: SEQ ID NO: 50, H2-light: SEQ ID NO: 51, H3-light: SEQ ID NO: 52, H4-light: SEQ ID NO: 53) were digested with EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and XhoI (NEB, R0146S) before cloning into a vector from the pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit enclosed in an OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019, Invitrogen) and a vector from the pcDNA™3.3-TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01), respectively, so as to construct recombinant vectors for expressing a humanized antibody. 
 Each of the constructed vectors was amplified using Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat no. 12662), and a transient expression was performed using Freestyle™ MAX 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). 293 F cells were used for the expression and cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium in a suspension culture manner. At one day before the transient expression, the cells were provided in the concentration of 5×10 5  cells/ml. After 24 hours, when the cell number reached 1×10 6  cells/ml, the transient expression was performed. A transfection was performed by a liposomal reagent method using Freestyle™ MAX reagent (Invitrogen), wherein in a 15 ml tube, the DNA was provided in the mixture ratio of 1:1 (heavy chain DNA:light chain DNA) and mixed with 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM (Invitrogen) (A), and in another 15 ml tube, 100 ul (microliter) of Freestyle™ MAX reagent and 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM were mixed (B), followed by mixing (A) and (B) and incubating for 15 minutes. The obtained mixture was slowly mixed with the cells provided one day before the transient expression. After completing the transfection, the cells were incubated in 130 rpm incubator for 5 days under the conditions of 37° C., 80% humidity, and 8% CO 2 . 
 After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to AKTA prime (GE Healthcare) to purify the antibody. In this regard, 100 mL of the supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to AKTA Prime equipped with a Protein A column (GE Healthcare, 17-0405-03), followed by elution with an IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004).

 For use in the introduction of random sequences into the CDRs of the antibody, primers were designed as follows. Conventionally, N codons were utilized to introduce bases at the same ratio (25% A, 25% G, 25% C, 25% T) into desired sites of mutation. In this experiment, the introduction of random bases into the CDRs of huAbF46 was conducted in such a manner that, of the three nucleotides per codon in the wild-type polynucleotide encoding each CDR, the first and second nucleotides conserved over 85% of the entire sequence while the other three nucleotides were introduced at the same percentage (each 5%) and that the same possibility was imparted to the third nucleotide (33% G, 33% C, 33% T). 
 1.5.2. Construction of a Library of huAbF46 Antibodies and Affinity for c-Met 
 The construction of antibody gene libraries through the introduction of random sequences was carried out using the primers synthesized in the same manner as in Reference Example 1.5.1. Two PCR products were obtained using a polynucleotide covering the scFV of huAbF46 as a template, and were subjected to overlap extension PCR to give scFv library genes for huAbF46 antibodies in which only desired CDRs were mutated. Libraries targeting each of the six CDRs prepared from the scFV library genes were constructed. 
 The affinity for c-Met of each library was compared to that of the wildtype. Most libraries were lower in affinity for c-Met, compared to the wild-type. The affinity for c-Met was retained in some mutants. 
 1.6. Selection of an Antibody with Improved Affinity from Libraries 
 After maturation of the affinity of the constructed libraries for c-Met, the nucleotide sequence of scFv from each clone was analyzed. The nucleotide sequences thus obtained are summarized in Table 7 and were converted into IgG forms. Four antibodies which were respectively produced from clones L3-1, L3-2, L3-3, and L3-5 were used in the subsequent experiments.

 1.7. Conversion of Selected Antibodies into IgG 
 Respective polynucleotides encoding heavy chains of the four selected antibodies were designed to have the structure of “EcoRI-signal sequence-VH-NheI-CH-XhoI” (SEQ ID NO: 38). The heavy chains of huAbF46 antibodies were used as they were because their amino acids were not changed during affinity maturation. In the case of the hinge region, however, the U6-HC7 hinge (SEQ ID NO: 57) was employed instead of the hinge of human IgG1. Genes were also designed to have the structure of “EcoRI-signal sequence-VL-BsiWI-CL-XhoI” for the light chain. Polypeptides encoding light chain variable regions of the four antibodies which were selected after the affinity maturation were synthesized in Bioneer. Then, a DNA fragment having the heavy chain nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 38) and DNA fragments having the light chain nucleotide sequences (DNA fragment including L3-1-derived CDR-L3: SEQ ID NO: 58, DNA fragment including L3-2-derived CDR-L3: SEQ ID NO: 59, DNA fragment including L3-3-derived CDR-L3: SEQ ID NO: 60, and DNA fragment including L3-5-derived CDR-L3: SEQ ID NO: 61) were digested with EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and XhoI (NEB, R0146S) before cloning into a vector from the pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit enclosed in an OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019, Invitrogen) and a vector from the pcDNA™3.3-TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01), respectively, so as to construct recombinant vectors for expressing affinity-matured antibodies. 
 Each of the constructed vectors was amplified using Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat no. 12662), and a transient expression was performed using Freestyle™ MAX 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). 293 F cells were used for the expression and cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium in a suspension culture manner. At one day before the transient expression, the cells were provided in the concentration of 5×10 5  cells/ml, and after 24 hours, when the cell number reached to 1×10 6  cells/ml, the transient expression was performed. A transfection was performed by a liposomal reagent method using Freestyle™ MAX reagent (Invitrogen), wherein in a 15 ml tube, the DNA was provided in the mixture ratio of 1:1 (heavy chain DNA: light chain DNA) and mixed with 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM (Invitrogen) (A), and in another 15 ml tube, 100 ul (microliter) of Freestyle™ MAX reagent and 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM were mixed (B), followed by mixing (A) and (B) and incubating for 15 minutes. The obtained mixture was slowly mixed with the cells provided one day before the transient expression. After completing the transfection, the cells were incubated in 130 rpm incubator for 5 days under the conditions of 37° C., 80% humidity, and 8% CO 2 . 
 After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to AKTA prime (GE Healthcare) to purify the antibody. In this regard, 100 mL of the supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to AKTA Prime equipped with a Protein A column (GE Healthcare, 17-0405-03), followed by elution with an IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004). The buffer was exchanged with PBS to purify four affinity-matured antibodies (hereinafter referred to as “huAbF46-H4-A1 (L3-1 origin), huAbF46-H4-A2 (L3-2 origin), huAbF46-H4-A3 (L3-3 origin), and huAbF46-H4-A5 (L3-5 origin),” respectively). 
 1.8. Construction of Constant Region- and/or Hinge Region-Substituted huAbF46-H4-A1 
 Among the four antibodies selected in Reference Example 1.7, huAbF46-H4-A1 was found to be the highest in affinity for c-Met and the lowest in Akt phosphorylation and c-Met degradation degree. In the antibody, the hinge region, or the constant region and the hinge region, were substituted. 
 The antibody huAbF46-H4-A1 (U6-HC7) was composed of (a) a heavy chain including the heavy chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1, U6-HC7 hinge, and the constant region of human IgG1 constant region, and (b) a light chain including the light chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1 and human kappa constant region. The antibody huAbF46-H4-A1 (IgG2 hinge) was composed of (a) a heavy chain including a heavy chain variable region, a human IgG2 hinge region, and a human IgG1 constant region, and (b) a light chain including the light chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1 and a human kappa constant region. The antibody huAbF46-H4-A1 (IgG2 Fc) was composed of (a) the heavy chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1, a human IgG2 hinge region, and a human IgG2 constant region, and (b) a light chain including the light variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1 and a human kappa constant region. Hereupon, the histidine residue at position 36 on the human kappa constant region of the light chain was changed to tyrosine in all of the three antibodies to increase antibody production. 
 For use in constructing the three antibodies, a polynucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 63) encoding a polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 62) composed of the heavy chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1, a U6-HC7 hinge region, and a human IgG1 constant region, a polynucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 65) encoding a polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 64) composed of the heavy chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1, a human IgG2 hinge region, and a human IgG1 region, a polynucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 67) encoding a polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 66) composed of the heavy chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1, a human IgG2 region, and a human IgG2 constant region, and a polynucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 69) encoding a polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 68) composed of the light chain variable region of huAbF46-H4-A1, with a tyrosine residue instead of histidine at position 36, and a human kappa constant region were synthesized in Bioneer. Then, the DNA fragments having heavy chain nucleotide sequences were inserted into a vector from the pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit enclosed in an OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019, Invitrogen) while DNA fragments having light chain nucleotide sequences were inserted into a vector from the pcDNA™3.3-TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01) so as to construct vectors for expressing the antibodies. 
 Each of the constructed vectors was amplified using Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat no. 12662), and a transient expression was performed using Freestyle™ MAX 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). 293 F cells were used for the expression and cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium in a suspension culture manner. At one day before the transient expression, the cells were provided in the concentration of 5×10 5  cells/ml, and after 24 hours, when the cell number reached to 1×10 6  cells/ml, the transient expression was performed. A transfection was performed by a liposomal reagent method using Freestyle™ MAX reagent (Invitrogen), wherein in a 15 ml tube, the DNA was provided in the mixture ratio of 1:1 (heavy chain DNA:light chain DNA) and mixed with 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM (Invitrogen) (A), and in another 15 ml tube, 100 ul (microliter) of Freestyle™ MAX reagent and 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM were mixed (B), followed by mixing (A) and (B) and incubating for 15 minutes. The obtained mixture was slowly mixed with the cells provided one day before the transient expression. After completing the transfection, the cells were incubated in 130 rpm incubator for 5 days under the conditions of 37° C., 80% humidity, and 8% CO 2 . 
 After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to AKTA prime (GE Healthcare) to purify the antibody. In this regard, 100 mL of the supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to AKTA Prime equipped with a Protein A column (GE Healthcare, 17-0405-03), followed by elution with IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004). The buffer was exchanged with PBS to finally purify three antibodies (huAbF46-H4-A1 (U6-HC7), huAbF46-H4-A1 (IgG2 hinge), and huAbF46-H4-A1 (IgG2 Fc)). Among the three antibodies, huAbF46-H4-A1 (IgG2 Fc) was representatively selected for the following examples, and referred as L3-1Y-IgG2. 
 Reference Example 2: Preparation of an Anti-Ang2 Antibody 
 2.1. Preparation of a Hybridoma 
 A human Ang2 protein (R&D systems; 623-AN-025/CF) was administered to 5-week-old BALB/c mice along with an adjuvant to induce an immune response and then, hybridomas that produce an individual anti-Ang2 antibody were prepared according to the known methods described by Schwaber, et al. (Schwaber, J and Cohen, E. P., “Human x Mouse Somatic Cell Hybrid Clones Secreting Immunoglobulins of Both Parental Types,” Nature, 244 (1973), 444-447). 
 More specifically, to obtain immunized mice necessary for developing hybridoma cell lines, 100 ug of human Ang2 protein (R&D Systems) mixed with the same amount of a complete Freund's adjuvant was administered via an intraperitoneal injection to each of five 4-6-week-old BALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Inc.). After two weeks, the antigen (half the previously injected amount) mixed with an incomplete Freund's adjuvant using the same method as described above was administered to each mouse via an intraperitoneal injection. After one additional week, a final boosting was performed and three days later, blood was collected from the tail of each mouse to obtain serum, which was then diluted at 1/1000 with PBS and subjected to an ELISA to verify that the titer of an antibody recognizing Ang2 was increased. From the results, mice in which a sufficient amount of the antibody was obtained were selected, and a cell fusion process was performed on the selected mice. 
 Three days before the cell fusion experiment, a mixture of 50 ug of PBS and 100 ug of human Ang2 protein (R&D systems) was administered via an intraperitoneal injection to BALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Inc.), and after each immunized mouse was anesthetized, its spleen located on the left side of the body was extracted. The extracted spleen was ground with a mesh to isolate cells, which were mixed with a culture medium (DMEM, Hyclon) to prepare a spleen cell suspension. The suspension was centrifuged to collect a cell layer. The obtained 1×10 8  spleen cells were mixed with 1×10 7  myeloma cells (Sp2/0), and the mixture was centrifuged to precipitate the cells. The centrifuged precipitate was slowly dispersed, treated with 1 ml of 45% polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500) contained in a culture medium (DMEM), and maintained at 37° C. for one minute before adding 1 ml of a culture medium (DMEM). Subsequently, 10 ml of the culture medium (DMEM) was added for 1 minute to the resultant, which was incubated in a water bath at 37° C. for 5 minutes and then re-centrifuged after the total volume was adjusted to 50 ml. The resulting cell precipitate was re-suspended in an isolation medium (HAT medium) at a concentration of 1˜2×10 5 /ml, and the resultant suspension was distributed at 0.1 ml to the each well of a 96-well plate, which was then incubated in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37° C. to prepare the hybridoma cell groups. 
 2.2. Selection of Anti-Ang2 Antibody Producing Clone and Purification of Antibody 
 The above obtained individual antibody producing hybridomas were screened using a typical ELISA format to select hybridomas which produce 95 anti-Ang2 monoclonal antibodies among the hybridomas differentiated from their mother hybridomas, based on their binding potential with Ang2. 
 More specifically, to select the hybridoma cells that specifically react only to Ang2 protein among the hybridoma cell groups prepared in Reference Example 2.1 above, an ELISA assay method using a human Ang2 protein as an antigen was used for screening. 
 Human Ang-2 protein was added to a microtiter plate at the amount of 100 ng per each well to be adhered to the surface of the plate, and unreacted antigens were removed by washing. 50 μl of the hybridoma cell culture obtained in Reference Example 2.1 above was added to each well to react for 1 hour and then, the wells were sufficiently washed with phosphate buffered saline-TWEEN 20 (PBST) solution to remove unreacted culture solution. Goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP) was added thereto, a reaction was allowed to occur at a room temperature for 1 hour and then, washing was sufficiently performed with the TBST solution. Subsequently, substrate solution (OPD) of peroxidase was added to each well to react, and the reaction degree was measured by the absorption at 450 nm using an ELISA reader to repeatedly select hybridoma cell lines that secret antibodies having specifically high binding affinity only to human Ang2 protein. A limiting dilution was performed on the hybridoma cell lines obtained through repetitive selection to obtain final 58 clones of hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies. The prepared hybridomas were deposited in the Korean Cell Line Bank located at Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea, as of Apr. 23, 2013 and received accession number KCLRF-BP-00295. 
 Each hybridoma obtained above was cultured in DMEM (Dulbeco's Modified Eagle's Medium) and then, the culture solutions were collected and subjected to Protein G-affinity chromatography method to purify anti-Ang2 monoclonal antibodies produced from each hybridoma. 
 First, the hybridoma cells cultured in 50 ml of culture medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) FBS were centrifuged to obtain a cell precipitate, which was washed at least twice with 20 ml of PBS to remove the FBS. The cell precipitate was re-suspended in 50 ml of the culture medium (DMEM) and then incubated in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37° C. for 3 days. Subsequently, the cell culture was centrifuged to remove the antibody-producing cells, and the culture medium including the secreted antibodies was isolated and then, stored at 4° C. or used directly. Antibodies were purified from 50 to 300 ml of the culture medium using an AKTA purification device (GE Healthcare) equipped with an affinity column (protein G agarose column; Pharmacia, USA). The purified antibodies were stored for subsequent use after replacing the supernatant with PBS using a filter for protein aggregation (Amicon). One of the antibodies obtained from the hybridomas above was named 10D6. 
 The binding affinity of the above antibody to human Ang-2 protein was measured by an SPR method using a BIAcore T100 (GE Healthcare). The SPR method uses refractive index change of light which passes a sensor chip according to the state of materials coated onto the sensor chip, and if an antigen or an antibody is flowed onto a chip coated with the antigen or antibody, it causes changes in refractive index due to their binding and Kd values are thus calculated from the measured values. 
 First, anti-His antibody was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE healthcare) up to 8,000 RU levels using a pH 5.0 acetate solution and an amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare). 6 μg/ml of a recombinant hAng-2 (C-His, R&D Systems) protein was flowed onto the chip to be captured at 100 to 200 RU levels. The antibody obtained in Example 2 above was diluted serially from 100 nM concentration and flowed onto the chip to allowing the antibody to bind to (on), dissociate from (off), and regenerate (using 10 mM NaOH solution) from the antigen captured on the sensor chip, thereby measuring antigen-antibody affinity. With regard to hAng2, such experiments were conducted, and the results are as shown in the following Table 8.

 2.3. Cloning of Genes of an Anti-Ang2 Antibody 
 A whole RNA was obtained using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) from the antibody-producing hybridoma (2×10 6  cells) obtained from Reference Example 2.2 above. Then, by using this as a template, only the gene sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of the monoclonal antibody to be produced in the hybridoma was amplified using a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), a Mouse Ig-Primer Set (Novagen), and a thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystem) under the following conditions: 5 min. at 94° C.; [30 min. at 50° C., 15 min. at 95° C.], [1 min. at 94° C., 1 min. at 50° C., 2 min. at 72° C.]×35 cycles; 6 min. at 72° C.; cooling to 4° C. 
 The PCR products obtained from each reaction were subjected to a direct DNA sequencing to obtain the CDR, heavy chain variable regions (wherein the 113 th  amino acid “S” is substituted with “L”) and light chain variable regions of the antibody, and nucleotide sequences encoding them, and the obtained results are set forth in the following Tables 9 to 12.

 2.4. Competition ELISA Assay of 10D6 Antibody Against Ang2-Tie2 Binding 
 Ang2-Tie2 binding competition ELISA was conducted using the antibody binding to Ang-2 prepared in Reference Example 2.3 above. 
 More specifically, MaxiSorp™ flat-bottom plate (Nunc) of 96-well was coated with hTie2-Fc (R&D Systems) which is a protein bound with 4 μg/ml of Fc of human IgG1. After that, the plate was washed five times with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20-containing PBS (phosphate buffer saline) and then blocked with 1% (v/v) BSA (bovine serum albumin; Sigma)-containing PBS at a room temperature for 2 hour. 
 For Ang2:Tie2 competition ELISA, each anti-Ang2 antibody obtained in Example 2 was placed at various concentrations of 400 nM-0.001 nM into each well coated with the hTie-2/Fc fusion protein along with 1% (v/v) BSA and 400 ng/ml of a FLAG-tagged hAng-2 and then, the plate was allowed to react at a room temperature for 2 hours and washed five times with PBST. After that, an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) conjugated with HRP diluted in 1% (v/v) BSA-containing PBS at a ratio of 1:5,000 (v/v) was added in an amount of 100 μl to each well to react at a room temperature for 1 hour and then, the plate was washed five times with PBST. Lastly, 100 μl of TMB substrate (Cell Signaling) was added to each well of the plate to induce color development for 3 min. and then, the reaction was ceased by the addition of 100 μl of Stop solution (Cell Signaling) and OD450 values were measured on a plate reader (Molecular Devices). 
 For comparison, the same test was carried out using 4H10 which is an anti-Ang2 antibody inhibiting Ang2-Tie2 binding. The 4H10 is an antibody having the following heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region.

 An inhibitory degree (%) against Ang2-Tie2 binding is shown in  FIG. 2 . As seen in  FIG. 2 , unlike 4H10 which is an anti-Ang2 antibody inhibiting Ang2-Tie2 binding, the 10D6 antibody did not inhibit binding between Ang2-Tie2 receptor. 
 2.5. Verification of Antigen Recognizing Site (Epitope) of Ang2 Antibody 
 To verify the epitope (or specific binding site) of the anti-Ang2 antibody prepared in Reference Example 2.3, an ELISA was performed using a recombinant protein where a receptor binding domain (RBD) of Ang2 protein in the form of being tagged with Flag was mutated by artificial means. 
 Each well of a 96-well MaxiSorp™ flat-bottom plate (Nunc) was coated with 50 ul (microliter) of 1000 nM antibody. Then, the plate was washed five times with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20-containing PBS (PBST) and blocked with 1% (v/v) BSA-containing PBS at a room temperature for 2 hours. 250 ng of each mutant Ang2 protein obtained by substituting S417, Q418, P419, N421, 1434, D448, A449, P452, Y460, N467, K468, or F469 residue of Ang2 protein tagged with a FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO: 198), Sigma) at its N-terminal with alanine was added to each well of the plate, which was then allowed to react at a room temperature for 2 hours. 
 The plate was washed five times with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 containing PBS, reacted with an anti-FLAG antibody (SIGMA) conjugated with HRP which was diluted in 1% (v/v) BSA-containing PBS at a ratio of 1:5,000 (v/v) at a room temperature for 1 hour, and washed five times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20-containing PBS. 
 Finally, 50 ul of TMB substrates (Cell signaling) was added to each well of the plate to induce color development at a room temperature for 3 min. and the reaction was ceased by the addition of 50 ul of Stop solution (Cell signaling) and then, OD450 values were measured on a plate reader (Molecular Devices). By comparing binding affinities with mutated Ang2 to those of unmutated Ang2, each epitope of Ang2 antibodies was identified. The obtained measurement results of the binding affinities (%) with mutant Ang2 against the binding affinity with the native Ang2 are shown in the following Table 13.

 2.6. Phosphorylation Induction of Tie2 Receptor by 10D6 Antibody 
 As Ang2 induces a change in vascular endothelial cells by binding to a Tie-2 receptor expressed in the vascular endothelial cells to induce the phosphorylation of the receptor and activate it, a test for analyzing an influence of the anti-Ang2 antibody on Tie2 phosphorylation was conducted using a cell-based assay. 
 For this, HUVEC (ATCC) cells (1×10 6 ) were cultured in a 100 mm culture dish using EGM-2 (Lonza) media at 37° C. and when they reached 80˜90% confluency, the media were replaced with serum-free media and cultured at 37° C. for 6 to 16 hours. The dish was washed once with PBS and after the replacement with 1 nM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma)-mixed serum free media (Lonza), they were further cultured for 10 min. After washed once again with PBS, the cultured cells were treated with a mixture prepared by mixing the anti-Ang2 antibody (10D6) having various concentrations (600˜0.06 nM) with 40 nM of Ang2 protein (R&D systems) and letting them stand for 20 min. and further cultured for 10 min. The cells were washed using PBS, treated with 400 μl of a lysis buffer (Roche), collected to a tube to be dissolved at 4° C. for 30 min. and then, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. to measure a supernatant using Nanodrop. 
 1 μg of Tie2 antibody (R&D system) was added to 0.8 mg of a cell lysate, which was then overnight reacted at 4° C. and then subjected to immunoprecipitation by the addition of protein A bead (GE Healthcare) thereto. The obtained reactant was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. to obtain a pellet, which was washed two to three times with a lysis buffer (Roche), added to a sample buffer (Invitrogen) mixed with a reducing agent, and boiled at 95° C. for 5 min., and then, applied to NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). 
 To see the presence of the phosphorylation of Tie2, the membranes were blocked with PBST mixed with 3% (v/v) skim milk (Sigma) for 30 min. and identified using an HRP-conjugated anti-phospho tyrosine antibody (Millipore). For Tie2 identification, the blots were reacted in a stripping buffer (Thermo) for 15 min, then blocked again and identified using an Tie2 antibody (Santa cruz). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 3A . As shown in  FIG. 3A , when 10D6 antibody was added together with Ang2, the phosphorylation of Tie2 was more strongly induced at every antibody concentration range tested than the case in which Ang2 was treated alone. 
 In addition, referring to the above method, when 60 nM of antibody 10D6 and Ang2 were treated, the phosphorylation level of Tie2 was measured and compared with the case of treating a control antibody (anti-Ang2 antibody (Regeneron) which has MOA of inhibiting binding between Ang2 and Tie2; represented as ‘RG antibody’). The obtained immunoblotting results are shown in  FIG. 3B . After treating with the antibody (10D6 or RG), the blot band density of pTyr and Tie2 was measured using ImageJ software and pTyr/Tie2 ratio was calculated. The obtained result is demonstrated in  FIG. 3C . 
 As shown in  FIGS. 3B and 3C , when treated with antibody 10D6, Tie2 phosphorylation level is increased by 180% compared to Ang2 treatment alone; whereas, when treated with control antibody RG, Tie2 phosphorylation level is decreased by 67% compared to Ang2 treatment alone, indicating that antibody 10D6 has about 8.6-fold higher Tie2 phosphorylation effect than control antibody. In  FIGS. 3B and 3C  “NC” represents Tie2 phosphorylation in untreated cells. 
 2.7. Activation Induction of Tie2 Signaling by 10D6 Antibody 
 To see whether 10D6 antibody induces the activation of the downstream signaling of a Tie2 receptor as well as the activation of the Tie2 receptor itself, the phosphorylation degrees of proteins participating in the downstream signaling when Ang2 alone or Ang2 and 10D6 antibody was treated were tested using immune blotting. To compare the activation degrees of the downstream signaling, the same test was conducted with regard to a group in which Ang1 (R&D systems), and Ang2 (R&D systems) and an anti-Ang2 antibody (RG antibody; control antibody having MOA inhibiting Ang2-Tie2 binding, Regeneron Co.) were treated together. 
 Specifically, HUVEC (ATCC) cells (1×10 6 ) were cultured in a 6-well culture dish using EGM-2 (Lonza) media at 37° C. and when they reached 80˜90% confluency, the media were replaced with serum-free media (Lonza) and cultured at 37° C. for 6 to 16 hours. The dish was washed once with PBS, and the cultured cells were treated with a mixture prepared by mixing 60 nM of the Ang2 antibody (10D6) with 40 nM of Ang2 protein (R&D systems) and letting them stand for 20 min. and further cultured for 30 min. For comparison, groups in which Ang1 (R&D systems) 4 nM, Ang2 (R&D systems) 40 nM, and Ang2 (R&D systems) 40 nM+anti-Ang2 antibody (Regeneron) 60 nM were treated respectively were prepared. 
 The cells were washed using PBS, treated with a lysis buffer (Roche), collected to a tube to be dissolved at 4° C. for 30 min. and then, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. to measure a supernatant. A sample buffer (Invitrogen) mixed with a reducing agent was added to 25 μg of a cell lysate, which was boiled at 95° C. for 5 min., and then, applied to NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). 
 To see the presence of the phosphorylation of Akt, eNOS and 42/44 involved in the downstream signaling, the blots were blocked with PBST mixed with 3% (v/v) skim milk (Sigma) for 30 min. and then treated with an anti-pAkt antibody, anti-p-eNOS antibody, and anti-p-42/44 antibody (all of them; Cell signaling). The blots were reacted in a stripping buffer (Thermo) for 15 min. and then blocked again to identify Akt, eNOS, and 42/44 using an anti-Akt antibody, anti-eNOS antibody, and anti-42/44 antibody (all of them; Cell signaling). 
 As shown in  FIG. 4A , in the Ang1 only treatment group and the Ang2 and 10D6 co-treatment group, downstream signaling was strongly induced in comparison with the Ang2 only treatment group and the Ang2 and RG antibody co-treatment group, and the effects in the Ang2 and 10D6 antibody co-treatment group was at least equal to those in the Ang1 sole-treatment group. 
 In addition, the phosphorylation of Tie2 receptor and a protein (Akt) which participates in downstream signaling of Tie2 by treating anti-Ang2 antibody was measured in animal model (in vivo). More particularly, 5 mg/kg of antibody was injected alone or together with 20 μg of Ang2 into tail vein of 7-8 week old C57BL6 mouse, and 1 hour after, lung tissue was removed. The obtained lung tissue was subjected to homogenization lysis using lysis buffer (Roche) and FastPrep kit (MP biomedicals). Activities of Tie2 and Akt in the obtained tissue lysate were measured by the above-described method. 
 The obtained results are demonstrated in  FIGS. 4B and 4C . In  FIGS. 4B and 4C , “REGN” or “RG” represents a control antibody (anti-Ang2 antibody of Regeneron). As shown in  FIGS. 3B and 3C , even in vivo experimentation, antibody 10D6 exhibits considerable effect of phosphorylating Tie2 and a protein, Akt, participating in downstream signaling of Tie2. 
 2.8. ELISA Assay for Identifying Formation of 10D6-Ang2-Tie2 Complex 
 As it was confirmed that 10D6 anti-Ang2 antibody activates Tie2 signaling without inhibiting Ang2-Tie2 binding, an ELISA was conducted to see whether a complex between the antibody and Ang2:Tie2 receptor is formed. 
 A 96-well MaxiSorp™ flat-bottom plate (Nunc) was coated with 4 μg/ml of Tie2-Fc (R&D systems) or BSA (Sigma). Then, the plate was washed five times with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20-containing PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) and blocked with 1% (v/v) BSA (Bovine serum albumin; Sigma)-containing PBS at a room temperature for 2 hours. 0.25 μg/ml of Ang2 and 2 μg/ml of 10D6 antibody were added to each well of the plate, which was allowed to react at a room temperature for 2 hours and then washed five times with PBST. After that, an anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) conjugated with HRP diluted in 1% (v/v) BSA-containing PBS at a ratio of 1:5,000 (v/v) was added in an amount of 100 ul to each well to react at a room temperature for 1 hour and then, the plate was washed five times with PBST. Lastly, 100 ul (microliter) of TMB substrate (Cell Signaling) was added to each well of the plate to induce color development for 3 min. and then, the reaction was ceased by the addition of 100 ul of Stop solution (Cell Signaling) and OD450 values were measured on a plate reader (Molecular Devices). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 5 . As seen in  FIG. 5 , it was confirmed that 10D6 antibody formed a complex by binding to Ang2 which was bound to Tie2. 
 2.9. Preparation of an scFv of Mouse Antibody 10D6 
 A gene for producing an scFv fragment was designed using the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of mouse antibody 10D6 prepared in Reference Example 2.3. The heavy chain variable region (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 115; coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: 116) and the light chain variable region (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 117; coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: 118) were linked to form ‘VH-linker-VL’ construct, and the linker is designed to have the amino acid sequence of ‘GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 184)’. The amino acid sequence of the designed ‘VH-linker-VL’ (scFv of 10D6) is represented in SEQ ID NO: 188 and the coding nucleotide sequence thereof is represented in SEQ ID NO: 189. 
 2.10. Preparation of Gene Library for Affinity Maturation 
 2.10.1. Selection of Target CDR and Preparation of Primers 
 To perform affinity maturation, six complementary determining regions (CDRs) were defined from the prepared mouse antibody 10D6 according to the ‘Kabat numbering’ rule. The CDRs are summarized in Table 14:

 For use in the introduction of random sequences into the CDRs of the antibody, primers were designed as follows. Conventionally, N codons were utilized to introduce bases at the same ratio (25% A, 25% G, 25% C, 25% T) into desired sites of mutation. In this experiment, the introduction of random bases into the CDRs of 10D6 was conducted in such a manner that, of the three nucleotides per codon in the wild-type polynucleotide encoding each CDR, the first and second nucleotides conserved over 85% of the entire sequence while the other three nucleotides were introduced at the same percentage (each 5%) and that the same possibility was imparted to the third nucleotide (33% G, 33% C, 33% T). 
 2.10.2. Construction of Gene Library of scFv of 10D6 Antibody 
 The construction of antibody gene libraries through the introduction of random sequences was carried out using the primers synthesized in the same manner as in Reference Example 2.10.1. Two PCR products were obtained using a polynucleotide covering the 10D6 scFv (SEQ ID NO: 189) as a template (see  FIG. 6 ), and were subjected to overlap extension PCR to give scFv library genes for 10D6 antibodies in which only desired CDRs were mutated. 10 7 ˜10 8  libraries targeting each of the six CDRs prepared from the scFv library genes were constructed. 
 The affinity for Ang2 of each library was compared to that of the wild-type. Most libraries were lower in affinity for Ang2, compared to the wild-type. However, in some mutants, the affinity for Ang2 was retained. 
 2.11. Selection of Antibody with Improved Affinity from Libraries 
 Among the scFv libraries provided in Reference Example 2.10, the scFv fragments showing upper 1.0 percent of affinity to Ang-2 were selected, and this process was repeated four times. The nucleotide sequence of each of the selected scFv was analyzed. The obtained nucleotide sequences are summarized in Table 15, and were converted into IgG forms (a heavy chain constant region: constant region of human IgG1, a light chain constant region: constant region of human KAPPA Chain). Five antibodies which were respectively produced from clones VH-6.6, VH-6.7, VL-(6.11), VL-(6.17), and VL-HU1(6.22) were used in the subsequent experiments.

 2.12. Preparation of Humanized Antibody 10D6-HU1, 10D6-HU2, 10D6-HU3, and 10D6-HU5, from Mouse Antibody 10D6 
 2.12.1. Heavy Chain Humanization) 
 To design three domains 10D6-HU1 Heavy, 10D6-HU2-heavy, and 10D6-HU5-heavy, human germline genes which share the highest identity/homology with the VH gene of the mouse antibody 10D6 purified were analyzed through an Ig BLAST (IgBLAST online database tool, maintained by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, Md.). The analysis results revealed that IGHV4-b*01 (DP-67; accession number: Z12367) has an identity/identity/homology of 72% at the amino acid level. CDR-H1(SEQ ID NO: 109), CDR-H2(SEQ ID NO: 110), and CDR-H3(SEQ ID NO: 111) of the mouse antibody 10D6 were defined according to Kabat numbering. A design was made to introduce the CDR of the mouse antibody 10D6 into the framework of IGHV4-b*01 (named as 10D6-HU1, SEQ ID NO: 185; 
 QVQLQESGPGLVKPSETLSLTCAVSGYSISSDYAWNWIRQPPGKGLEWIGYINYSGN TDYNPSLKSRVTISVDTSKNQFSLKLSSVTAADTAVYYCARGNFEGAMDYWGQGTL VTVSS). Hereupon, a back mutation to the amino acid sequence of the mouse 10D6 were conducted at positions 30 (S→T), to establish antibody 10D6-HU5 (SEQ ID NO: 164). Then, 10D6-HU5 was further mutated at positions 48 (I→M), 67 (V→S), and 71 (V→R), to establish 10D6-HU2(SEQ ID NO: 186;
 
QVQLQESGPGLVKPSETLSLTCAVSGYSITSDYAWNWIRQPPGKGLEWMGYINYSG NTDYNPSLKSRSTISRDTSKNQFSLKLSSVTAADTAVYYCARGNFEGAMDYWGQGT LVTVSS).
 
 For use in designing 10D6-HU3-heavy, human antibody frameworks were analyzed by a BLAST search. The result revealed that the Herceptin backbone, which known to show very low immunogenicity of about 0.1% level among the pre-existing humanized antibodies, is very similar in framework and sequence to the mouse antibody 10D6. CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of the mouse antibody 10D6 were defined according to Kabat numbering and introduced into the Herceptin backbone, wherein back mutations were conducted at positions 27 (F-Y), 28 (N→S), 30 (K→T), 48 (V→M), 49 (A→G), 67 (F→S), 71 (A→R), 78 (A→F), and 93 (S→A), to establish 10D6-HU3 (SEQ ID NO: 187; EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGYSITSDYAWNWVRQAPGKGLEWMGYINYS GNTDYNPSLKSRSTISRDTSKNTFYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARGNFEGAMDYWGQ GTLVTVSS). 
 2.12.2. Light Chain Humanization 
 To design a H1-light, human germline genes which share the highest identity/homology with the VL gene of the mouse antibody 10D6 were analyzed through an Ig BLAST (IgBLAST online database tool, maintained by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, Md.). The analysis results revealed IGKV1-39*01(012; accession number: X59315) has an identity/identity/homology of 66% at the amino acid level. CDR-L1(SEQ ID NO: 112), CDR-L2(SEQ ID NO: 113), and CDR-L3(SEQ ID NO: 114) of the mouse antibody 10D6 were defined according to Kabat numbering. A design was made to introduce the CDR of the mouse antibody 10D6 into the framework of IGKV1-39*01. 
 Thereafter, DNA fragments of heavy chains (10D6-VHHU1, 10D6-VHHU2, 10D6-VHHU3, and 10D6-VHHU5) were respectively cloned into a vector of pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit enclosed in an OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019, Invitrogen) using EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and nheI (NEB, R0131), and a DNA fragment of a light chain (10D6-VLHU1 (SEQ ID NO: 165), coding sequence: SEQ ID NO: 177) was cloned into a vector of pcDNATM3.3-TOPO TA Cloning Kit using EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and XhoI (NEB, R0146S), to construct recombinant vectors for expressing a humanized antibody. 
 The constructed vectors were amplified using a Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat No. 12662), and the vectors including the heavy chain and the vector including the light chain were added to 293T cells (2.5×10 7 ) at a ratio of about 4:1 (about 80 μg:20 μg) with 360 μl of 2 M CaCl 2  and were transfected. Next, the mixture was cultured in a DMEM medium with 10% (w/v) FBS at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO 2  conditions for 5 hours, and then cultured in a DMEM medium without FBS at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO 2  conditions for 48 hours. 
 The cultured cells were centrifuged, and 100 ml of each supernatant was purified using AKTA Prime (GE healthcare). Protein A column (GE healthcare, 17-0405-03) was placed in the AKTA Prime, and the cultured solution was flowed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and was eluted with IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004). The buffer was replaced with a PBS buffer, and thus final humanized antibodies 10D6-HU1, 10D6-HU2, 10D6-HU3, and 10D6-HU5 were purified. 
 2.13. Incorporation of the Selected CDRs into Humanized Antibody and Transformation to IgG 
 The selected CDRs were incorporated into the heavy chain and the light chain of the humanized antibodies. Polynucleotides encoding the heavy chain of the antibodies were synthesized by Bioneer, Inc. so as to consist of ‘EcoRI-signal sequence-VH-NheI-CH-XhoI’ (SEQ ID NOs: 172-176). Polynucleotides encoding the light chain of the antibodies were synthesized by Bioneer, Inc. so as to consist of ‘EcoRI-signal sequence-VL-BsiWI-CL-XhoI’ (SEQ ID NOs: 177-179). The polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 172-176) encoding the heavy chain were respectively cloned into a vector of pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit included in OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019; Invitrogen), and the polynucleotides (SEQ ID NOs: 177-179) encoding the light chain were respectively cloned into a vector of pcDNA™3.3-TOPOTA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01), using EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and XhoI (NEB, R0146S), to establish vectors for expressing affinity matured antibodies. 
 The constructed vectors were amplified using a Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat No. 12662), and the vectors including the heavy chain and the vector including the light chain were added to 293T cells (2.5×10 7 ) at a ratio of about 4:1 (about 80 μg:20 μg) with 360 μl of 2 M CaCl 2  and were transfected. Next, the mixture was cultured in a DMEM medium with 10% (w/v) FBS at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO 2  conditions for 5 hours, and then cultured in a DMEM medium without FBS at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO 2  conditions for 48 hours. 
 The cultured cells were centrifuged, and 100 ml of each supernatant was purified using AKTA Prime (GE healthcare). Protein A column (GE healthcare, 17-0405-03) was placed in the AKTA Prime, and the cultured solution was flowed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and was eluted with IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004). The buffer was replaced with a PBS buffer, and thus final affinity-matured antibodies h10D6-Opti-1, h10D6-Opti-2, h10D6-Opti-3, and h10D6-Opti-4 were purified.

 2.14. Analysis of Binding Affinity of Selected Antibodies 
 The binding affinity (KD values) of the antibodies to human Ang2 protein was measured by an SPR method using a BIAcore T100 (GE Healthcare). 25 μg/ml anti-His antibody was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE healthcare) using a pH 5.0 acetate solution and an amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare). 6 μg/ml of a recombinant hAng2 (C-His, R&D Systems) protein was flowed onto the chip to be captured at 100 to 200 RU levels. The antibodies obtained in the above examples were diluted serially to twice each time starting from 100 nM concentration and it was each flowed onto the chip to allow it to be bound to (on), dissociated from (off), and regenerated (using 10 mM NaOH solution) from the antigen captured on the sensor chip, thereby to measure antigen-antibody affinity. The KD values were calculated from the values of k on , k off , and the results are as shown in the following Table 17.

 As shown in Table 17, the affinity to Ang2 of the mouse antibody 10D6 is about 8 nM, the affinities to Ang2 of the 5 affinity-matured and humanized antibodies are from about 0.14 nM to about 0.92 nM. The results indicate that the affinity to Ang2 can be improved at least about 5 times up to about 37 times in the affinity-matured antibodies in an IgG form transformed from a scFv form. 
 2.15. Analysis of In Vitro Biological Property of the Selected Affinity-Matured Antibodies—Akt Phosphorylation 
 To examine whether the humanized and/or affinity-matured 10D6 antibodies can induce activation of downstream signaling as well as Tie2 receptor, the levels of Akt phosphorylation in HUVEC (ATCC) cells treated with Ang2 and each of the antibodies (see Table 16) of Reference Example 2.13 were measured and compared to that of the case treated with Ang2 only. HUVEC (ATCC) cells (2×10 4  cells) were cultured in 96 well plate using EGM-2 medium (Lonza) at 37° C., and when they reached 80˜90% confluency, the media were replaced with serum-free medium (Lonza) and cultured at 37° C. for 6 hours. The cultured cells were treated with a mixture prepared by mixing 6 nM or 1.2 nM of each of the anti-Ang2 antibodies of Reference Example 2.13 with 4 nM of Ang2 protein (R&D systems) and letting them stand for 20 min. and further cultured for 30 min. 
 The phosphorylation of Akt which participates in downstream signaling of Tie2 receptor was examined using PathScan® Phospho-Akt Chemiluminescent Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell signaling, #7134). The cells were washed using PBS, treated with 30 μl of a lysis buffer (Roche), to be subjected to cell lysis at 4° C. for 30 minutes. Then, 30 μl of diluent buffer (Cell Signaling) was added to each well and sufficiently mixed with pipet, and 50 ul of the diluted product was collected and transferred to a phosphor-Akt Ab coated microwell, to react at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours, the well was washed with 1× washing buffer (Cell Signaling) four times, and treated with 50 μl of Akt1 detection antibody solution (Cell Signaling), to react at room temperature for one hour. As the same process, the well was washed, and reacted with 50 ul of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) at room temperature for 30 minutes. As the same process, the well was washed, and treated with 50 ul of a mixture solution of luminol/enhancer solution (GE healthcare) and stable peroxide buffer (GE healthcare) at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Then the plate was placed in a luminometer (Envision 2104 plate reader, Perkin Elmer), to measure a relative light unit (RLU). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIGS. 7A and 7B . As seen in  FIGS. 7A and 7B , the humanized and/or affinity-matured antibodies of Reference Example 2.13 induce the downstream signaling more intensively compared to mouse antibody 10D6. 
 2.16. Synthesis of a Polynucleotide for Preparing an scFv of Humanized Antibody of 10D6 (Opti-1) 
 The gene for preparing scFv of a humanized 10D6 antibody was designed using the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of humanized 10D6 antibody Opti-1. The heavy chain variable region (amino acid sequence: Hu2 6.6 (SEQ ID NO: 160); coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: 172), and the light chain variable region (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: Hu1 (SEQ ID NO: 165); coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: SEQ ID NO: 177) were linked to form a ‘VH-linker-VL’ construct, and the linker was designed so as to have the amino acid sequence of ‘GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 184)’. The polynucleotide (SEQ ID NO: 191) encoding the designed scFv (VH-linker-VL; SEQ ID NO: 190) of antibody 10D6 opti-1 was synthesized by Bioneer, Inc. 
 2.17. Preparation of Gene Library for the Secondary Affinity Maturation 
 2.17.1. Selection of Target CDR and Preparation of Primers 
 To perform affinity maturation of antibody 10D6 opti-1, three complementary determining regions (CDRs) were defined from the prepared antibody 10D6 opti-1 according to the ‘Kabat numbering’ rule. The CDRs are summarized in Table 18:

 For use in the introduction of random sequences into the CDRs of the antibody, primers were designed as follows. Conventionally, N codons were utilized to introduce bases at the same ratio (25% A, 25% G, 25% C, 25% T) into desired sites of mutation. In this experiment, the introduction of random bases into the CDRs of 10D6 was conducted in such a manner that, of the three nucleotides per codon in the wild-type polynucleotide encoding each CDR, the first and second nucleotides conserved over 85% of the entire sequence while the other three nucleotides were introduced at the same percentage (each 5%) and that the same possibility was imparted to the third nucleotide (33% G, 33% C, 33% T). 
 2.17.2. Construction of Gene Library of scFv of 10D6 Opti-1 Antibody 
 The construction of antibody gene libraries through the introduction of random sequences was carried out using the primers synthesized in the same manner as in Reference Example 2.17.2. Two PCR products were obtained using a polynucleotide covering the 10D6 opti-1 scFv (SEQ ID NO: 191) as a template (see  FIG. 8 ), and were subjected to overlap extension PCR to give scFv library genes for 10D6 antibodies in which only desired CDRs were mutated. 10 7 ˜10 8  libraries targeting each of the six CDRs prepared from the scFv library genes were constructed. 
 The affinity for Ang2 of each library was compared to that of the wild-type. Most libraries were lower in affinity for Ang2, compared to the wild-type. However, in some mutants, the affinity for Ang2 was retained. 
 2.18. Selection of Antibody with Improved Affinity from Libraries 
 Among the scFv libraries provided in Reference Example 2.17, the scFv fragments showing upper 1.0 percent (%) of affinity to Ang-2 were selected, and this process was repeated four times. The nucleotide sequence of each of the selected scFv was analyzed. The obtained nucleotide sequences are summarized in Table 19, and were converted into IgG forms (a heavy chain constant region: constant region of human IgG1, a light chain constant region: constant region of human KAPPA Chain). Four antibodies which were respectively produced from clones 10D6_VL-Hu1-2.1, 10D6_VL-Hu1-2.4, 10D6_VL-Hu1-2.7, 10D6_VL-Hu1-2.8 were used in the subsequent experiments.

 2.19. Incorporation of the Selected CDRs into Humanized Antibody and Transformation to IgG 
 The selected CDRs were incorporated into the heavy chain and the light chain of the humanized antibodies. The heavy chain was derived from the antibody cloned with Hu2-6.6 or Hu3-6.6. Polynucleotides encoding the light chain of the antibodies were synthesized by Bioneer, Inc. so as to consist of ‘EcoRI-signal sequence-VL-BsiWI-CL-XhoI’ (see Table 20). The polynucleotides encoding the heavy chain were respectively cloned into a vector of pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit included in OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019; Invitrogen), and the polynucleotides encoding the light chain were respectively cloned into a vector of pcDNA™3.3-TOPOTA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01), using EcoRI (NEB, R0101S) and XhoI (NEB, R0146S), to establish vectors for expressing affinity matured antibodies. 
 The constructed vectors were amplified using a Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat No. 12662), and the vectors including the heavy chain and the vector including the light chain were added to 293T cells (2.5×10 7 ) at a ratio of about 4:1 (about 80 μg:20 μg) with 360 μl of 2 M CaCl 2  and were transfected. Next, the mixture was cultured in a DMEM medium with 10% (w/v) FBS at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO 2  conditions for 5 hours, and then cultured in a DMEM medium without FBS at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO 2  conditions for 48 hours. 
 The cultured cells were centrifuged, and 100 ml of each supernatant was purified using AKTA Prime (GE healthcare). Protein A column (GE healthcare, 17-0405-03) was placed in the AKTA Prime, and the cultured solution was flowed at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and was eluted with IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004). The buffer was replaced with a PBS buffer, and thus final affinity-matured antibodies (hereinafter, named as h10D6-Opti-63, h10D6-Opti-65, h10D6-Opti-67, h10D6-Opti-71, h10D6-Opti-68, h10D6-Opti-70, h10D6-Opti-72, and h10D6-Opti-73) were purified.

 2.20. Analysis of Binding Affinity of Selected Antibodies 
 The binding affinity (KD values) of the antibodies to human Ang2 protein was measured by an SPR method using a BIAcore T100 (GE Healthcare). 25 μg/ml anti-His antibody was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (GE healthcare) using a pH 5.0 acetate solution and an amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare). 6 μg/ml of a recombinant hAng2 (C-His, R&D Systems) protein was flowed onto the chip to be captured at 100 to 200 RU levels. The antibodies obtained in the above examples were diluted serially to twice each time starting from 100 nM concentration and it was each flowed onto the chip to allow it to be bound to (on), dissociated from (off), and regenerated (using 10 mM NaOH solution) from the antigen captured on the sensor chip, thereby to measure antigen-antibody affinity. The KD values were calculated from the values of k on , k off , and the results are as shown in the following Table 21.

 As shown in Table 21, all the affinity-matured and humanized antibodies show high affinity to Ang2 from about 0.000129 nM to about 0.43 nM. 
 2.21. Analysis of In Vitro Biological Property of the Selected Affinity-Matured Antibodies—Akt Phosphorylation 
 To examine whether the humanized and/or affinity-matured 10D6 antibodies can induce activation of downstream signaling as well as Tie2 receptor, the levels of Akt phosphorylation in HUVEC (ATCC) cells treated with Ang2 and each of the antibodies (see Table 20) of Reference Example 2.19 were measured and compared to that of the case treated with Ang2 only. HUVEC (ATCC) cells (2×10 4  cells) were cultured in 96 well plate using EGM-2 medium (Lonza) at 37° C., and when they reached 80˜90% confluency, the media were replaced with serum-free medium (Lonza) and cultured at 37° C. for 6 hours. The cultured cells were treated with a mixture prepared by mixing 6 nM or 1.2 nM of each of the anti-Ang2 antibodies of Example 13 with 4 nM of Ang2 protein (R&D systems) and letting them stand for 20 min. and further cultured for 30 min. 
 The phosphorylation of Akt which participates in downstream signaling of Tie2 receptor was examined using PathScan® Phospho-Akt Chemiluminescent Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell signaling, #7134). The cells were washed using PBS, treated with 30 μl of a lysis buffer (Roche), to be subjected to cell lysis at 4° C. for 30 minutes. Then, 30 μl of diluent buffer (Cell signaling) was added to each well and sufficiently mixed with pipet, and 50 μl of the diluted product was collected and transferred to a phosphor-Akt Ab coated microwell, to react at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours, the well was washed with 1× washing buffer (Cell signaling) four times, and treated with 50 μl of Akt1 detection antibody solution (Cell signaling), to react at room temperature for one hour. As the same process, the well was washed, and reacted with 50 μl of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell signaling) at room temperature for 30 minutes. As the same process, the well was washed, and treated with 50 μl of a mixture solution of luminol/enhancer solution (GE healthcare) and stable peroxide buffer (GE healthcare) at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Then the plate was placed in a luminometer (Envision 2104 plate reader, Perkin Elmer), to measure a relative light unit (RLU). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 9 . As seen in  FIG. 9 , the humanized and/or affinity-matured antibodies of Reference Example 2.19 induce the downstream signaling more intensively compared to mouse antibody 10D6. 
 Example 1: Preparation of an Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody 
 The anti-Ang2 scFv [(heavy chain variable region (Amino acid sequence: Hu2 6.6 (SEQ ID NO: 160); Coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: 172))-(linker: SEQ ID NO: 184)-(light chain variable region (Amino acid sequence: Hu1-1 (SEQ ID NO: 192; the 100 th  amino acid residue “Q” of Hu1 (SEQ ID NO: 165) is substituted with “G” (Q100G)); Coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: SEQ ID NO: 193))] obtained on Reference Example 2.16 was fused to the C-terminus of Fc of the anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y-IgG2 prepared in Reference Example 1, to prepare a bispecific antibody. 
 The heavy chain part of L3-1Y-IgG2 antibody which was used in the bispecific antibody cloning was prepared as follows. A DNA fragment encoding the heavy chain of the anti-c-Met antibody was synthesized by deleting the part encoding C-terminus part from position 1393 of SEQ ID NO: 67 and inserting “ggcggtggtggttccggaggcggcggatcc” instead of the deleted part (Bioneer Corporation). Thereafter, the DNA fragment was ligated to a vector from the pOptiVEC™-TOPO TA Cloning Kit included in OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019) (Invitrogen). 
 An anti-Ang2 scFv was prepared by linking the heavy chain variable region (SEQ ID NO: 160) and the light chain variable region (SEQ ID NO: 192) of anti-Ang2 antibody via a peptide linker (GGGGS) 2 . In particular, a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 172) encoding the heavy chain variable region (SEQ ID NO: 160) of anti-Ang2 antibody, a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 193) encoding the light chain variable region (SEQ ID NO: 192) of anti-Ang2 antibody, and a nucleotide sequence encoding the peptide linker were all synthesized by Bioneer Corporation (in the form including a N-terminal BamHI restriction site and C-terminal XhoI restriction site). 
 Then, the obtained anti-Ang2 scFv was cloned in the prepared L3-1Y-IgG2 containing vector using restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI, to construct an expression vector for the heavy chain of the bispecific antibody. 
 Each region of the amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 194; Coding nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: 195) encoding the heavy chain of the bispecific antibody (wherein the heavy chain of the c-Met antibody and the anti-Ang2 scFv are linked through the peptide linker) is summarized in following Table 22:

 In addition, the DNA fragment encoding the light chain of the anti-c-Met antibody was synthesized so that it has the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 69 (Bioneer Corporation). The DNA fragment encoding the light chain of the anti-c-Met antibody was inserted into a vector from the pcDNA™3.3-TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Cat no. 8300-01) included in OptiCHO™ Antibody Express Kit (Cat no. 12762-019) (Invitrogen), to construct an expression vector for the light chain of the anti-c-Met antibody. 
 Each region of the amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 68) encoding the light chain of the anti-c-Met antibody is summarized in following Table 23:

 Each of the constructed expression vectors for the heavy chain and the light chain was amplified using Qiagen Maxiprep kit (Cat no. 12662), and a temporary expression was performed using Freestyle™ MAX 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). For the expression, 293F cells were used and subjected to a suspension culture using FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium. One day before the temporary expression, the cells were provided at the amount of 5×10 5  cells/ml, and 24 hours after, when the number of the cells reaches 1×10 6  cells/ml, the temporary expression was performed. A transfection was performed by liposomal reagent method using Freestyle™ MAX reagent (Invitrogen). In 15 ml tube, the DNA fragments encoding the heavy chain and the light chain were provided at the ratio of 1:1 (heavy chain DNA:light chain DNA), and mixed with 2 ml of OptiPro™ SFM (Invitrogen) (mixture (A)). In another 15 ml tube, 100 ml of Freestyle™ MAX reagent and 2 ml of  OptiPro™ SFM  2 ml were mixed (mixture (B)). Then mixtures (A) and (B) were mixed and incubated for 15 minutes, and the obtained mixture was slowly added to and mixed with the cell provided one day before. After the transfection was completed, the cells were incubated for 4 days under the conditions of 37° C., 80% humidity, and 8% CO2 in 130 rpm incubator. 
 The incubated cells were centrifuged and 100 ml of each supernatant was collected and purified using AKTA Prime (GE Healthcare). AKTA Prime was equipped with HiTrap MabSelect SuRe column (GE Healthcare, 11-0034-95). The cell culture solution was flowed at the flow rate of 5 ml/min, and then, eluted with IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific, 21004), and the obtained eluate was exchanged with PBS buffer. 
 Finally, an antibody wherein the anti-Ang2 scFv is fused to the C-terminus of the anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y-IgG2 was obtained and named as an anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01. 
 Example 2: Binding Affinity of the Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody to c-Met 
 The binding affinity of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody prepared in Example 1 to c-Met was measured using Biacore T100(GE). For this, a human Fab binder (#28-9583-25, GE Healthcare) was fixed on the surface of CM5 chip (#BR-1005-30, GE) according to manufacturer's manual. About 90˜120 RU of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody was captured and then, c-Met-Fc (#358-MT/CF, R&D Systems) was added to the captured antibody at various concentrations. Hereto, 10 mM Glycine-HCl (pH 1.5) solution was added, to regenerate the surface. To measure the affinity, the above obtained data were fitted using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare, Biacore T100 evaluation software). 
 The obtained results are illustrated in Table 24:

 As shown in Table 24, the bispecific antibody prepared in Example 1 shows the high affinity (about 0.07 nM) to c-Met, which is similar to that of an anti-c-Met antibody, L3-1Y/IgG2 prepared in Reference Example 1. 
 Example 3: Binding Affinity of the Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody to Ang2 
 The binding affinity of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody prepared in Example 1 to Ang2 was measured using Biacore T100(GE). For this, an anti-histidine antibody (R&D Systems) was fixed on the surface of CM5 chip (#BR-1005-30, GE) according to manufacturer's manual. C-terminal histidine-tagged human Ang2 (R&D Systems) was captured and then, anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 was added to the captured antigen (Ang2) at various concentrations. Hereto, 10 mM Glycine-HCl (pH 1.5) solution was added, to regenerate the surface. To measure the affinity, the above obtained data were fitted using BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare, Biacore T100 evaluation software).

 Example 4: Cancer Cell Growth Inhibiting Effect of the Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody 
 A cancer cell inhibiting effect of anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 prepared in Example 1 was examined for a gastric cancer cell line MKN45 and a lung cancer cell line EBC1. 
 5000 cells of MKN45 cell line (JCRB0254) and 5000 cells of EBC1 cell line (JCRB0820) were seeded in each well including RPMI medium (GIBCO; 100 μl/well), and treated with anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 at the amount of 60 nM (per 1 treatment) for 6 days. The change in the cell number was measured by CellTiter Glo (CTG) assay. In particular, after incubating for 6 days, 100 μl of CTG solution (Promega) was added to each well, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The obtained luminescent signal was recorded using Envision 2104 Multi-label Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., USA). 
 For comparison, the same experiment was performed for groups treated with no antibody (None), anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y/IgG2 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 1), anti-Ang2 antibody 10D6 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 2.3), anti-Ang2 antibody 4H10 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 2.4), a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 10D6 (60 nM each), a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10 (60 nM each), and an bispecific antibody comprising L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10 scFv (BsAb; prepared referring to Example 1; 60 nM). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 10  (MKN45) and  FIG. 11  (EBC1). As shown in  FIGS. 10 and 11 , anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 exhibits increased inhibition cancer cell growth, compared to the case wherein each or a combination of an anti-c-Met antibody and an anti-Ang2 antibody is administered. 
 To examine the inhibitory effect of anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 on the phosphorylation of signal transduction-related proteins, the Erk phosphorylation level was measured in cell lines MKN45 and EBC1 treated with anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01. In particular, each of the cell lines MKN45 and EBC1 were seeded on 60 mm plate at the amount of 2×10 5  cells/ml, and 24 hours after, 5 μg/ml of anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 (serum-free) was administered to each cell line for 30 minutes. The Erk phosphorylation level by Erk kinase was measured by western blotting. 
 For comparison, the same experiment was performed for groups treated with no antibody (None), anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y/IgG2 alone (5 μg/ml; Reference Example 1), anti-Ang2 antibody m10D6 alone (5 μg/ml; Reference Example 2.3), anti-Ang2 antibody 4H10 alone (5 μg/ml; Reference Example 2.4), a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 10D6 (5 μg/ml each), a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10 (5 μg/ml each), and an bispecific antibody comprising L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10 scFv (BsAb; prepared referring to Example 1; 5 μg/ml). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 12  (MKN45) and  FIG. 13  (EBC1). As shown in  FIGS. 12 and 13 , anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 considerably inhibits the phosphorylation of Erk, compared to the case wherein each or a combination of an anti-c-Met antibody and an anti-Ang2 antibody is administered. Such inhibitory effect of MA01 on the phosphorylation of signal transduction related protein such as Erk may contribute to the cancer cell growth inhibitory effect. 
 Example 5: Apoptosis by the Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody 
 To confirm the anticancer effect of anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01, the effect on apoptosis of cancer cells was examined. 
 The effect of anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 to kill cancer cells was examined for lung cancer cell line EBC1. 
 5000 cells of EBC1 cell line (JCRB0820) were seeded in each well including RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO; 100 μl/well), and treated with anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 at the amount of 60 nM (per 1 treatment) for 6 days. The change in the cell number was measured by  Caspase  3/7 Glo assay. In particular, after incubating for 6 days, 100 μl of  Caspase  3/7 Glo solution (Promega) was added to each well, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The obtained luminescent signal was recorded using Envision 2104 Multi-label Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., USA). 
 For comparison, the same experiment was performed for groups treated with no antibody (None), anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y/IgG2 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 1), anti-Ang2 antibody 10D6 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 2.3), anti-Ang2 antibody 4H10 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 2.4), a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 10D6 (60 nM each), a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10 (60 nM each), and an bispecific antibody comprising L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10 scFv (BsAb; prepared referring to Example 1; 60 nM). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 14 . As shown in  FIG. 14 , anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 exhibits increased induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, compared to that of each or a combination of an anti-c-Met antibody and an anti-Ang2 antibody, or bispecific antibody of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 4H10. 
 Example 6: Cancer Cell Metastasis-Inhibiting Effect of the Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody 
 Since Ang2 and c-Met are both related to cancer metastasis as well as cancer cell proliferation, the effect of the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 prepared in Example 1 on cell motility was observed. The inhibition effect of the bispecific antibody on HUVEC(→EBC1) migration by Ang2+HGF was tested as follows: 
 A migration assay was performed using xCelligence-RTCA DP system (Roche), to confirm whether or not the motility of endothelial cells induced by HGF and Ang2 is inhibited. The xCelligence-RTCA DP system used is a non-invasive cell monitoring system capable of measuring impedance generated when a cell is attached on a gold microelectrode array in real-time thereby determining changes of cells. For the cell migration assay, CIM-plate16 (GE Healthcare) consisting of a lower chamber (having chemoattractant) and a upper chamber was used, to measure and record the impedance generated when a cell on the upper chamber moves to the lower chamber having chemoattractant passing through 8 μm pores and attaches to the bottom. As the chemoattractant, 100 ng/ml HGF (R&D systems) and 200 ng/ml Ang2, which are added to RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, was used. The anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 was added to the upper chamber at the concentration of 1 μg/ml. 10000 cells of lung cancer cell line EBC1 were seeded in each well. For comparison, the same experiment was performed for groups treated with no antibody (None), anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y/IgG2 alone (1 μg/ml; Reference Example 1), and anti-Ang2 antibody 10D6 alone (1 μg/ml; Reference Example 2.3). 
 The obtained results are illustrated in  FIG. 15 . As shown in  FIG. 15 , the anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 exhibits an inhibitory effect on EBC1 migration by Ang2+HGF wherein the inhibitory effect is considerably increased, compared with that of L3-1Y-IgG2 or 10D6 alone. 
 Example 7: Effect of the Anti-c-Met/Anti-Ang2 Bispecific Antibody to Overcome a Resistance to c-Met Targeting Drugs 
 To confirm the possibility of anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 to overcome the resistance to c-Met targeting drugs, an ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 (ATCC, HTB77) which is resistant to anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y/IgG2 of Reference Example 1. Referring to the method described in Example 4, 5000 cells of SKOV3 were treated with anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 (60 nM), and 6 days after, the cell number was measured by CellTiter Glo assay. 
 For comparison, the same experiment was performed for groups treated with no antibody (None), anti-c-Met antibody L3-1Y/IgG2 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 1), anti-Ang2 antibody m10D6 alone (60 nM; Reference Example 2.3), and a combination of L3-1Y/IgG2 and 10D6 (60 nM each). 
 The obtained results are shown in  FIG. 16 . As shown in  FIG. 16 , anti-c-Met/anti-Ang2 bispecific antibody MA01 has an excellent effect to overcome the resistance to c-Met targeting drugs, compared with that of L3-1Y-IgG2 and/or 10D6 alone.
