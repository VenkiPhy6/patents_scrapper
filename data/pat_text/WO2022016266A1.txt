 Field of the Invention  
 [0001] The present invention generally relates to the field of probiotics, and more particularly relates to a novel probiotic that promotes oral health.  
 Background of the Invention  
 [0002] The oral cavity houses one of the most diverse microbiotas in the human body. It provides several unique niches for bacterial colonization, such as the saliva, the tongue, the cheek, other mucosal surfaces, as well as the non-shedding surfaces of teeth. There are close to 800 unique oral bacterial species identified on the Human Oral Microbiome Database, with more species expected to be added with further sampling and identification. As with microbiota of other sites of the human body, a balanced oral microbiota is essential to the health of the human host. Alterations to this balance, or a dysbiotic microbial community, can not only lead to various diseases in the mouth, such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis, but can also cause disease systemically.  
 [0003] Dental caries is the most prevalent oral disease worldwide, estimated to have affected 2.4 billion people in 2016, while periodontal disease is the 11th most prevalent disease globally. Halitosis is a common problem in many individuals, and has a worldwide prevalence of 22% to 50%. Dental caries is caused by a combination of host factors and excessive dietary sugar intake, which leads to fermentation and production of acidic metabolites and extracellular polymeric substances by acidogenic bacteria residing in the supragingival plaque. Continued exposure to fermentable carbohydrates creates a positive feedback loop, where localized regions of low pH within the plaque biofilms produced by the acidogenic bacteria continues to select for acidogenic and aciduric bacteria. The continued exposure of the tooth to acidification causes the demineralization-remineralization balance to tilt towards demineralization, resulting in the progression of caries. Streptococcus mutans is the oral bacteria that is most associated with causing dental caries. Targeting S. mutans has been shown to be a successful method to reduce the incidence of dental caries.  
 [0004] Periodontal disease is an inflammatory disease induced by the subgingival microbiota, leading to the destruction of the supporting structures of the tooth. Unlike most dysbiotic diseases, periodontal disease is associated with increased microbial diversity in the subgingival crevice. Pathogenic species associated with periodontal disease include Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia , Fusobacterium nucleatum and anaerobic species enriched in virulence factors that are able to 

survive in the highly inflammatory environment of the diseased gum. When periodontal disease is severe, not only can it lead to tooth loss, but also to various systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and rheumatoid arthritis.  
 [0005] For halitosis, or oral malodour, 80-90% of the cases are attributed to the volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) released by the degradation of organic substances by oral anaerobic bacteria, mainly residing on the tongue. Some of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease, such as Po. gingivalis , are known VSC producers, and thus, periodontal disease is also associated with halitosis. Comparisons of tongue coatings of halitosis patients against healthy controls have revealed several VSC-producing bacterial species that are commonly found in halitosis patients. The genera Prevotella and Leptotrichia (including species Pr. shahii, Pr. intermedia , and L. wadei) are considered to be highly associated with halitosis, as well as other taxa such as Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Ta. forsythia.  
 [0006] Due to the recent awareness on the importance of maintaining a healthy microbiota, probiotics have become an exciting method for preventing or treating diseases associated with dysbiosis. Probiotics are defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (F AO/WHO) as " live microorganisms, which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host" . While the majority of probiotics developed are targeted to gut health, oral health probiotics are emerging as an important means to maintain the oral microbiota and prevent oral diseases.  
 [0007] Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop novel probiotics for use to promote oral health.  
 Summary of the Invention  
 [0008] A novel probiotic has now been developed that promotes oral health. Specifically, the probiotic is a novel strain of Streptococcus salivarius.  
 [0009] Thus, in one aspect of the invention, a novel strain of Streptococcus salivarius is provided which encodes for the bacteriocin, subtilosin.  
 [0010] In another aspect of the invention, a method of preventing disease in a mammal, or restoring oral health in mammal, is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an S. salivarius probiotic that produces subtilosin to the oral cavity of the mammal.  
 [0011] In a further aspect of the invention, an S. salivarius strain is provided which exhibits anti microbial activity that is protease-resistant. 

[0012] These and other aspects of the invention are described in the detailed description by reference to the following figures.

 Detailed Description of the Invention  
 [0017] A novel Streptococcus salivarius strain is provided which is useful to prevent and/or treat disease in a mammal. In one aspect, the present S. salivarius strain, herein referred to as S. salivarius DB-B5, encodes for the bacteriocin, subtilosin, inhibits multiple oral pathogens, and can colonize human cell surfaces.  
 [0018] The term “disease” is used herein to encompass disease within the oral cavity such as dental caries, periodontal disease (e.g. gingivitis and periodontitis), halitosis, dysbiosis within the oral cavity which can lead to systemic disease, as well as disease that occurs in other parts of the body, such as cancer or gastrointestinal disease by pathogenic microorganisms that originate in the oral cavity.  
 [0019] The present S. salivarius strain advantageously inhibits oral pathogens linked to disease. 
 As used herein, the term “oral pathogen” refers to pathogenic microorganisms that exist in the oral cavity, or which originate in the oral cavity but may localize in other parts of the body to result in disease beyond the oral cavity. Examples of oral pathogens inhibited by the present S. salivarius strain include, but are not limited to, strains of the Prevotella genus such as Pr. shahii, strains of the Porphyromonas genus such as Po. gingivalis, strains of the Fusobacterium genus such as F. nucleatum , strains of the Leptotrichia genus such as L. wadei, and strains of the Peptostreptococcus genus such as Pe. stomatis. 

[0020] The ability of an S. salivarius strain to inhibit pathogens may be determined using known assays such as an agar overlay assay in which a target pathogenic strain in liquid agar is added to an agar plate comprising homogeneous growth of the present S. salivarius strain. Detection of zones of inhibition, i.e. clear zones in which there is no growth of the target pathogen, indicates that the present S. salivarius strain inhibits the target pathogenic strain. The greater the zone (or width) of inhibition, the more virulent the inhibition.  
 [0021] The anti -pathogenic properties of the present S. salivarius strain are due, at least in part, to its bacteriocin expression profile. The present S. salivarius strain uniquely produces subtilosin, a bacteriocin which S. salivarius strains do not characteristically produce. The subtilosin locus of an S. salivarius strain according to an embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 4, and the proteins it encodes are shown in Figure 3. Exemplary proteins encoded by this locus include an Ml 3 family metallopeptidase, ABC transporter and ABC transporter ATP binding protein, radical S-adenosyl-L- methionine proteins, a helix-turn-helix domain-containing protein and phosphoglycerate mutase. Anti- pathogenic properties of the present S. salivarius strain are protease-resistant, at least in part, for example, these properties are resistant to proteases, such as at least one of pronase, subtilisin, or Proteinase K.  
 [0022] In addition, the present strain may encode other anti-pathogenic compounds, such as a thiazolyl peptide bacteriocin, not typically produced by S. salivarius , and a bacteriocin-like peptide (blp) bacteriocin. The bacteriocin loci may be found in the chromosomal DNA of the organism, or in extrachromosomal structures such as plasmids or episomes. The unique bacteriocin expression profile of the present S. salivarius strain provides the strain with inhibitory properties that allow it to target a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms.  
 [0023] In one embodiment, the present S. salivarius strain has a genome consisting of one circular chromosome (2, 143,863 bp) with a GC content of 40.2%, one megaplasmid referred to as pIKMIN-B501 (138,497 bp) with a GC content of 35.6%, one small plasmid referred to as pIKMIN-B503 (3,225 bp) with a GC content of 39.6%, and one linear phage-like episome referred to as pIKMIN-B502 (57,714 bp) with a GC content of 39.1%. The strain possesses three separate loci encoding bacteriocins, a thiazolyl peptide (thiopeptide) locus on the megaplasmid, and subtilosin and blpU bacteriocin loci on the chromosome. The genome sequences were deposited at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information under GenBank accession numbers CP054153, CP054154, CP054155 and CP054156, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.  
 [0024] The present S. salivarius strain also advantageously exhibits significant growth dominance over the pathogen, S. mutans. When mixed and grown together under suitable growth 

conditions, e.g. grown on BHI agar and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2, the present S. salivarius strain outgrows S. mutans by at least about 10-90%, preferably by at least about 20%, 30% or 40%, for example, by about 40-80%.  
 [0025] The present S. salivarius strain is hydrophobic in nature, and thus, able to colonize human cell surfaces, enabling the strain to maintain a strong presence within the oral cavity on administration and thereby limit pathogen proliferation. The present S. salivarius strain exhibits a hydrophobicity of at least about 85%, preferably at least 90%-95%. As a comparison, other strains of S. salivarius , such as strain Ml 8, exhibit a hydrophobicity of less than 80%. Hydrophobicity may be determined using assays established in the art, for example, the Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbon (MATH) assay which is based on the determination of microbial hydrophobicity by differential partitioning at an aqueous- hydrocarbon interface. The assay includes mixing of the bacterial cell suspension with a hydrocarbon, preferably an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as dodecane, hexadecane, octane or p-xylene, for a predetermined period to allow optimal interaction of the bacteria with the hydrocarbon phase. Partitioning of the bacterial suspension between the aqueous and hydrocarbon phases is determined, and expressed as the percentage of cells adsorbed by the hydrocarbon phase. Thus, surface hydrophobicity is based on the difference in absorbance of cells in suspension at 595 nm initially and following incubation with a hydrocarbon. Other methods to determine hydrophobicity may also be used such as the salt aggregation test in which bacterial cell suspensions are tested for visible aggregation or "salting out" in ammonium sulfate. Degree of hydrophobicity is determined using varying concentrations of ammonium sulfate (the greater the degree of aggregation at lower concentrations, the greater the hydrophobicity).  
 [0026] The present S. salivarius strain is physiologically acceptable for use as a probiotic for administration to the oral cavity. The present strain is susceptible to antibiotics such as Vancomycin (glycopeptides), Gentamicin (aminoglycosides), Streptomycin (aminoglycosides), Clindamycin (lincosamides), Erythromycin (macrolides), Ampicillin and Penicillin (penicillins), tetracycline and chloramphenicol (phenicols). The present strain has been determined to be a non-producer of toxic biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine, cadaverine, tryptamine, serotonin, putrescine and spermine/spermidine. In addition, the present strain does not encode virulent factors based on genome analysis that would render its use in mammals to be detrimental.  
 [0027] The present S. salivarius strain ferments carbohydrates. Exemplary carbohydrates fermented by the S. salivarius strain include, but are not limited to, D-galactose, D-glucose, fructose, 

mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, amygdalin, arbutin, esculin ferric citrate, raffmose, gentiobiose, salicin, cellobiose, maltose, melibiose, saccharose, trehalose and inulin.  
 [0028] The present S. salivarius strain is useful to prevent and/or treat disease in a mammal. The term “mammal” is used herein to refer to both human and non-human mammals, including domesticated animals such as, but not limited to, cats, dogs and other pets, horses, livestock, etc. The method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of the S. salivarius strain to a mammal to treat or prevent disease in the mammal. The term “therapeutically effective” refers to an amount of probiotic which is effective to reduce or minimize at least one factor associated with a target disease such as oral disease, including reducing the presence or activity of pathogenic microorganisms linked to dental caries such as S. mutans , pathogenic species associated with periodontal disease such as Porphyromonas gingivalis , and Fusobacterium nucleatum , and volatile sulphur compound (VSC)-producing bacteria such as Prevotella (e.g. Pr. shahii and Pr. intermedia), Leptotrichia (e.g. L. wadei), Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and pathogenic species that may spread to cause disease elsewhere in the body, e.g. Fusobacterium nucleatum. In this regard, a therapeutically effective amount of the present S. salivarius strain is about 500 million to 20 billion CFUs per day.  
 [0029] The present S. salivarius strain may be formulated for administration in the form of a powder, tablet, capsule, suspension, and the like. Generally, probiotic cells such as the present S. salivarius cells, are dried to enhance viability/shelf-life, either by freeze-drying or spray-drying, using known techniques. The cells may be admixed with protective agents, such as, sweet whey concentrate, concentrated milk, lactose, saccharose, trehalose, galactose, starch, sorbitol, casein, beta-lactoglobulin, alpha- lactalbumin, soy, serum albumin, glutenin, prolamin, lysine, cysteine, glycine, or vitamins, to enhance survival following spray-drying. The dried cells may also be combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, i.e. which are not unacceptably toxic or otherwise unacceptable for administration to a mammal, such as a diluent, filler or bulking agent, lubricant, colorant, binder, coating agent, flavouring and/or sweetening agent, anti-caking agent, suppository base, etc. Suitable excipients are those which do not adversely affect S. salivarius growth and/or colonization. For powders, tablets and capsules, common excipients include, but are not limited to, microcrystalline cellulose (as binder/diluent), rice maltodextrin (as binder/diluent), mannitol or dextrin (filler), silicon dioxide (gliding/anti-caking agent), magnesium stearate (as lubricant), and hydroxy propyl methylcellulose (as suspending/viscosity agent). 

[0030] The dried cells may be administered in dry form, or may be suspended in a liquid, e.g. an aqueous-based liquid, for oral administration, e.g. as an oral rinse, which may be ingested or discarded following rinsing of the oral cavity for a sufficient period of time, e.g. 30 seconds to 1 or 2 minutes.  
 [0031] The S. salivarius strain may also be formulated for administration in foods or beverages such as milk-based products, e.g. milk, yogurt, ice cream, puddings, whipped toppings or cheese products, drinks, fruit juices, soy or cereal-based products, confectionery products such as candy, gummies, chocolate, cookies, pastries and other baked goods, frosting and the like, and various other products. Chewing gums, lozenges, tooth paste or gel, aqueous gel and oral strips may also be prepared comprising the S. salivarius strain.  
 [0032] The present formulations may additionally include ingredients to enhance taste, including flavors, e.g. fruit or mint flavor, and/or sweetener, preferably non-fermentable sweetener such as aspartame, sucralose, stevia (steviol glycosides), and monk fruit extract, as well as carbohydrates that are metabolized via different pathways such as xylitol, erythritol, glycerol, and allulose.  
 [0033] As one of skill in the art will appreciate, the present strain may be combined with one or more additional probiotics, including those that also treat or prevent oral disease, and those which treat other ailments. Examples of such probiotics include other S. salivarius strains, e.g. K12 and Ml 8 strains, other strains of Streptococcus species such as S. thermophilus , strains of Lactobacillus such as L. reuteri, L. brevis, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. paracasei, L. casei, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. acidophilus, strains of Bifidobacterium such as B. bifidum, B. longum, B. lactis, B. infantis , and B. breve, and strains of Bacillus such as B. subtilis and B. coagulans.  
 [0034] S. salivarius formulations may be supplemented with one or more additional therapeutic agents or dietary supplements which do not adversely affect S. salivarius growth and/or colonization. Exemplary additives include, but are not limited to, fluoride, vitamins (e.g. vitamin D, vitamin E), minerals, prebiotics, agents that prevent cariogenic activity such as calcium phosphate salts, antioxidants and mixtures thereof.  
 [0035] The formulation may include a preservative, which does not adversely affect S. salivarius growth and/or colonization, such as essential oils (orange oil, grape oil, clove oil, etc.), benzoates, sorbates, and the like.  
 [0036] Embodiments of the invention are described by reference to the following specific examples which are not to be construed as limiting. 

Example 1  
 [0037] The following methods were conducted to identify a novel strain of Streptococcus exhibiting properties having use in oral health.  
 [0038] Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions - Streptococcus salivarius DB-B5 and other probiotic candidates were newly isolated from the supragingival plaque of a healthy female donor (see isolation procedure below). Pr. shahii DSM 15611, F. nucleatum DSM 15643, Le. wadei DSM 19758, and Pe. stomatis DSM 17678 were purchased from the DSMZ culture collection (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH). S. mutans UA159, S. salivarius ATCC 13419 and Po. gingivalis ATCC 33277, were kindly provided by Dr. Cvitkovitch (University of Toronto, Faculty of Dentistry). All Streptococcus species were grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI; Hardy Diagnostics) at 37 °C in either anaerobic conditions, 5% CO2, or in regular atmospheric conditions. Po. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Pr. shahii DSM 15611, F. nucleatum DSM 15643, Le. wadei DSM 19758, and Pe. stomatis DSM17678 were grown in Schaedler's broth (Himedia) or plated on Brucella blood agar with hemin and vitamin K (Hardy Diagnostics) at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. All anaerobic conditions were maintained using the Anaerogen atmosphere generation system (Oxoid).  
 [0039] Isolation of Candidate Probiotic Strains - Supragingival plaque was collected from a healthy female donor with no history of oral diseases and a strong family history of healthy teeth. A sterile toothpick was used to collect the plaque, and immediately placed in 500 pL of sterile phosphate- buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.0). The plaque was vortexed vigorously for 2 min, and filtered through a 5.0 pm filter to remove large debris and most eukaryotic cells. Serial dilutions were plated onto BHI (Hardy Diagnostics) agar and incubated anaerobically for 48 h at 37 °C. Colonies were picked and re-streaked onto fresh BHI agar plates, and incubated aerobically for 48 h at 37 °C. Surviving colonies were re streaked an additional two times on BHI agar for purity.  
 [0040] Antimicrobial Activity Against Oral Pathogens - Probiotic candidates were assessed for their ability to inhibit oral bacteria associated with various oral diseases, using the bacterial inhibition overlay assay as described in Chew et al. (2015) J Appl Microbiol 118:1180-1190. https://doi.org/10.llll/jam.12772. The target bacteria used were: Po. gingivalis ATCC 33277, Pr. shahii DSM 15611, F. nucleatum DSM 15643, L. wadei DSM 19758 and Pe. stomatis DSM 17678. 10 pL of probiotic cells adjusted to OD 595  = 1.0 were spotted onto BHI agar plates and incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 °C overnight. The target cells were each mixed with 8 mL of their respective growth media, supplemented with 0.7% agarose. The media was maintained at 40 °C to prevent solidification, and the target cells were added so that the final adjusted OD 595  was 0.3-0.5. For 

Pr. shahii , the final OD595 was adjusted to 0.01. The target cell suspension was poured onto the probiotic candidate spots, and allowed to solidify, prior to incubating in the required conditions for each target species. The zone of inhibition surrounding the probiotic candidate spots after incubation was measured.  
 [0041] Competition Assay - Bacterial growth competition was measured between an isolated probiotic strain (referred to herein as S. salivarius DB-B5) and S. mutans UA159, as well as between S. salivarius ATCC 13419 and S. mutans UA159, using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Fresh cells were harvested in BHI media, and competing strains were mixed 1:1 in microcentrifuge tubes (t = 0 h). 100 pL of the mixture was spread on BHI agar plates, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were harvested and DNA extraction was performed on both the 24 h harvest sample, as well as the 0 h sample. DNA extraction was performed using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions for Gram-Positive Bacteria. qPCR was used to quantify the percent composition of the 2-species mixture, using the primers Ssaliv-qF and Ssaliv-qR for S. salivarius ATCC 13419, rpoB2-qF and rpoB2-qR for S. salivarius DB-B5, and Smut4-qF and Smut4-qR for S. mutans UA159 (Table 1).

 PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used following the manufacturer's instructions, with an activation step of 2 min at 50 °C, an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles consisting of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. The qToweri-G (Analytik Jena) was used to run the qPCR and samples were analysed using the qPCRsoft 3.2 software. Ct values were calculated to colony forming units (CFU) using a standard curve of bacterial CFU ranging from 10 9  to 10 3  CFU for each species used.  
 [0042] Molecular Identification of Candidate Probiotics - Colony PCR was performed on the candidate probiotics to identify their species. Single colonies were diluted in 10 pL of sterile dH 2 0 to be used as the template. Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used following 

the manufacturer's instructions, using the universal primers 8F and 1492R (Table 1), targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The cycle was run with an initial denaturation and cell breakage step of 1 min at 98 °C, 30 cycles consisting of 10 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using Sanger sequencing (The Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children) with the 8F and 1492R primers (Table 1). The resulting sequences were aligned and analyzed using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) against the NCBI database.  
 [0043] 16S rRNA Phylogenetic Analysis - 16S rRNA phylogeny reconstruction was performed as previously described (Naito et al. (2015). Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112:7791-7796. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1501676112). DNA was extracted from S. salivarius DB-B5 using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's guide for Gram-Positive Bacteria. The DNA was used as a template for the amplification of 16S rRNA using the universal primers 8F and 1492R (Table 1). Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used following the manufacturer's instructions, with an initial denaturation time of 30 s at 98 °C, 30 cycles consisting of 10 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using Sanger sequencing (The Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children) with the 8F and 1492R primers (Table 1). The consensus 16S sequences were aligned against other publicly available 16S rRNA sequences obtained from the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database (IMG; https://img.jgi.doe.gov/), using MUSCLE (Edgar RC (2004). Nucleic Acids Res 32:1792-1797. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkh340). Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenies were reconstructed under the GTR+I+ model of nucleotide substitution using MrBayes v.3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. (2012). Syst Biol 61 :539-542) run for 1,000,000 generations with 25% burn-in and PhyML (Guindon et al. (2010). Syst Biol 59:307-321) with 500 bootstrap replicates, respectively.  
 [0044] Multi-gene Phylogenetic Analysis - The multi-gene phylogenetic reconstruction was performed as previously described, with slight modifications (Naito et al. 2015). The amino acid sequences of the following genes, based on the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea were selected and concatenated: dnaG, frr, infC, nusA, pgk, rplA, rpoB, rpsC, smpB, tsf. The S. salivarius DB-B5 genes were obtained through Illumina sequencing of the full genome. Genes from all other bacterial species were obtained through IMG (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/). The concatenated amino acid sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenies were 

reconstmcted under the WAG+H model of amino acid substitution using MrBayes v.3.2.6 run for 1,250,000 generations with 20% burn-in and PhyML with 500 bootstrap replicates, respectively.  
 [0045] Carbohydrate Fermentation Profile - To determine the carbohydrate metabolic capability of S. salivarius DB-B5, the API 50CH (bioMerieux) system was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. The API strip containing S. salivarius DB-B5 was incubated aerobically at 37 °C, and the fermentation profile was measured at both 24 h and 48 h.  
 [0046] Cell Surface Hydrophobicity Assay - The cell surface hydrophobicity was examined using the Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbon (MATH) assay, with slight modifications (as described in Zoueki et al. Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 344:492-496). Fresh S. salivarius DB-B5 cells were harvested and washed twice in PBS (pH 7.0). Cells were adjusted to an OD595 of 0.3 (Ao), and 2.5 mL of the cell suspension was placed in a glass tube. 450 pL of n-hexadecane (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the bacterial cell suspension, and vortexed for 2 min. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow for phase separation. The aqueous phase was carefully removed and absorbance was measured at 595 nm (Ai). The surface hydrophobicity was calculated using the formula: Hydrophobicity (%) = (Ao-Ai)/(Ao) x 100.  
 [0047] Antibiotic Susceptibility Test - Antibiotic susceptibility was measured using ETEST strips 
 (bioMerieux), following the manufacturer's instructions. A lawn of S. salivarius DB-B5 was spread on a BHI agar plate, and a single ETEST strip was placed carefully on top using sterile forceps. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C under 5% CO2. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured by identifying the zone of inhibition that intersects the strip.  
 [0048] Genome Mining for Antibiotic Resistance Genes using CARD - The genome of S. salivarius DB-B5 was screened for genes involved in antibiotic resistance using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; https://card.incinaster.ca/) (as described by Jia et al. (2017) Nucleic Acids Res 45:D566-D573). CARD is an online bioinformatic database of antibiotic resistance determinants organized through the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO). The protein sequences of all predicted open reading frames (ORF) of S. salivarius DB-B5 was used as input for the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) tool on the CARD website.  
 [0049] Genome Mining for Virulence Factors using VFDB - The Virulence Factor Database 
 (VFDB)(Chen et al. (2016). Nucleic Acids Res 44:D694-D697) was used to screen for potential virulence factors in the S. salivarius DB-B5 genome. The VFDB core database was downloaded and a local reciprocal blastp analysis was performed against the protein sequences of all predicted ORFs of S. 

salivarius DB-B5 using the BLAST+ software (Camacho et al. (2009). BMC Bioinformatics 10:421). Greater than 50% identity match and E-values of less than 10 5  were used as cut-off values.  
 Results  
 [0050] Isolation of Oral Bacteria from Human Plaque - To isolate candidate probiotic species for oral health, the supragingival plaque of a healthy female donor was collected. The female donor was chosen due to her strong dental history: a complete absence of oral diseases, including childhood caries, which is also shared by her family members. After filtration, diluted plaque was plated on BHI agar and grown for 48 h anaerobically. Colonies were re-streaked and grown for 48 h aerobically. Around 500 bacterial colonies that are facultative anaerobes were selected for further testing.  
 [0051] Antimicrobial Activity against Oral Pathogens Associated with Periodontal Disease and 
 Halitosis and their Molecular Identity - Several target bacteria were chosen based on their association with various oral diseases: Po. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and F. nucleatum DSM 15643, as a target for periodontal diseases, and TV. shahii DSM 1561 1, he. wadei DSM 19758, and Pe. stomatis DSM 15611 as a target for halitosis. Based on the ability of isolates to inhibit at least two of the above target pathogens, 41 colonies were selected and their species identified via Sanger sequencing on their amplified 16S rRNA genes. The majority of the facultative anaerobe species were identified as S. salivarius or Streptococcus oralis. Table 2 shows the inhibition properties of the prime candidate probiotic, named S. salivarius DB-B5, and the common lab strain S. salivarius ATCC 13419 against the above pathogens. S. salivarius DB-B5 showed inhibitory properties against all of the pathogens, in differing amounts to the lab strain.

 [0052] Competition Ability against S. mutans - Since dental caries is one of the most common oral diseases, the ability of S. salivarius DB-B5 to outcompete S. mutans was measured. After 24 h of incubation, S. salivarius DB-B5 was able to significantly outcompete the caries-causing S. mutans UA159 (Fig. 1). Comparatively, the common lab strain, S. salivarius ATCC 13419, while showing slight 

competition activity, was not able to significantly outcompete S. mutans UA159. This indicates that the candidate probiotic S. salivarius DB-B5 can reduce the levels of this caries-causing bacteria through competition.  
 [0053] Phylogenetic Reconstruction of S. salivarius DB-B5 - In order to confirm the taxonomic placement of S. salivarius DB-B5, two different phylogenetic reconstructions were made. A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2A) and a multi-gene phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2B) using concatenated conserved genes based on the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea were constructed (see Wu et al. (2009). Nature 462: 1056-1060). Both trees confirm the placement of the candidate probiotic as a novel strain of the S. salivarius species.  
 [0054] Physical and Metabolic Characteristics of S. salivarius DB-B5 - The carbohydrate fermentation profile of S. salivarius DB-B5 was determined and compared to S. salivarius K12 (Burton et al. (2006) Appl Environ Microbiol 72: 3050-3), and other published S. salivarius phylotypes (P = phylotype, L = Lineage, I = Isolate) (van den Bogert et al. (2013) FEMS Microbiol Ecol 85:376-88). Fermentation ability was measured with API 50CH strips (Biomerieux). "+" indicates the ability to ferment the carbohydrate substrate, "+/- " indicates weak or variable reaction,
 
 indicates inability to ferment the substrate. S. salivarius DB-B5 was able to ferment 17 of the 49 carbohydrates tested. The comparison with other S. salivarius strains indicates that there are differences between the strains. The fermentation profile was found to be stable under numerous lab propagations, as well as fermentation and freeze-drying processes (data not shown).

 [0055] The cell surface hydrophobicity of S. salivarius DB-B5 was also assessed, to determine the likelihood of the strain to be able to colonize human cell surfaces, such as the oral environment. Using the MATH assay, S. salivarius DB-B5's measured hydrophobicity was 98.70%. The high cell surface hydrophobicity indicates that the candidate probiotic is able to attach and colonize the human oral environment well. 

[0056] Safety Evaluation of S. salivarius DB-B5 - S. salivarius DB-B5 was assessed for its antibiotic susceptibility using Etest strips (bioMerieux). A diverse group of antibiotic classes were tested, and S. salivarius DB-B5 was found to be susceptible to all antibiotics tested, according to both the European (EFSA) and the U.S.'s (CLSI) breakpoints for Streptococcus species (Table 4). As a guide, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)’s MIC breakpoints for antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus thermophilus (2018), and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)’s MIC breakpoints for viridans Streptococci (2019) are listed. MIC values greater than or equal to breakpoints were considered resistant.

 [0057] Antibiotic resistance was further tested using in silico methods. All predicted ORFs from 
 S. salivarius DB-B5 were run on the RGI tool from the CARD bioinformatic database, to detect potential antibiotic resistance genes. None of the ORFs from S. salivarius DB-B5 had "Perfect" (100% identical to the reference) or "Strict" (match bitscore above the curated BLASTP bitscore cutoff) hits against the database. RGI predicted 140 ORFs as "Loose" hits, which generally indicates distant homologs which may or may not have a role in antibiotic resistance.  
 [0058] The protein sequences of all predicted ORFs of S. salivarius DB-B5 were also analyzed for potential virulence genes using VFDB. The 15 VFDB-positive genes were compared to their actual predicted roles based on NCBI Blastp (nr database). The genes' presence in 7 commercially available probiotics were also assessed. The screened probiotics' genomes are Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Lactobacillus reuteri SD2112/ATCC 55730, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus R0011, S. salivarius K12, and S. salivarius Ml 8. There were 15 hits in total, and these genes were further analyzed for their virulence potential, along with their presence in 7 commercially available probiotic strains with publicly available genomes (Table 5). As seen in Table 5, 

the 15 genes are commonly found in many bacteria, including most of the commercially available probiotic strains with GRAS status. The genes are not believed to be of concern, with respect to safety.

Discussion  
 [0059] Probiotics have the ability to prevent disease while maintaining or restoring a healthy microbiota, and thus have become an attractive method as a preventative treatment in oral diseases. A major beneficial action of probiotics is their ability to protect the host against pathogen colonization. This study has indicated that at least two independent methods of protecting against pathogens exists in S. salivarius DB-B5: the secretion of an antimicrobial molecule that actively kills oral pathogens, including Po. gingivalis, Pr. shahii , F. nucleatum, L. wadei, and Pe. stomatis, and a mechanism that allows S. salivarius DB-B5 to outcompete S. mutans and inhibit its growth when grown together.  
 [0060] S. salivarius DB-B5 showed an extremely high cell surface hydrophobicity of 98.70%. 
 This is one of the highest percentages reported amongst probiotic strains. A high cell surface hydrophobicity is used as a proxy for the bacteria's ability to be able to colonize the host, and thus, is a desirable trait in probiotics. In the case of probiotics for oral health, the probiotics must adhere to various surfaces inside the mouth. Depending on the mode of delivery, the oral probiotics will have less time to colonize the oral environment, compared to the time gut probiotics have to colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, possessing a high cell surface hydrophobicity is a desirable characteristic in oral probiotics.  
 [0061] Extensive in vitro and in silico safety analysis of S. salivarius DB-B5 was conducted to ensure its suitability for human consumption. Generally, S. salivarius is considered a safe species since it is a normal commensal of the oral microbiota, acquired immediately after birth.  
 [0062] Antibiotic resistance and the horizontal transfer of resistance genes is one of the most important crises facing the medical community today. The susceptibility of probiotics to antibiotics is essential if it is to be widely used by consumers. S. salivarius DB-B5 was shown to be susceptible to the various antibiotics tested, which spanned a wide-range of antibiotic classes. The breakpoints to indicate susceptibility was based on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), as well as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) documents. In order to ensure that S. salivarius DB-B5 does not have any antibiotic resistance genes that may become mobile, the whole genome was mined for antibiotic resistance genes in silico. There was a good correspondence between the genotype and the phenotype for antibiotic resistance, where only loose hits (considered distant homologs which may or may not have a role in antibiotic resistance) were detected. This indicates that S. salivarius DB-B5 is safe to use commercially, with regards to antibiotic resistance.  
 [0063] 15 VFDB-positive genes were analyzed for their potential roles as virulence factors. All of the genes analyzed were common genes found in most bacteria, such as heat shock proteins, or genes 

involved in the biosynthesis of surface structures. Some of the genes flagged by VFDB are part of gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of virulence factors only in specific taxa. For instance, a gene identified as UDP -glucose pyrophosphorylase by VFDB is involved in hyaluronic acid capsule biosynthesis in Group A Streptococcus such as Streptococcus pyogenes. However, the same gene has a better hit with UTP -glucose- 1 -phosphate uridylyl transferase according to the nr database on NCBI BLAST, which is required for glycogenesis and cell wall metabolism in most bacteria. Furthermore, all other genes involved in hyaluronic acid biosynthesis were absent in the S. salivarius DB-B5 genome. Further analysis of all other genes that were positively identified under VFDB were found to have no actual virulence potential in S. salivarius DB-B5. The VFDB-positive genes were also present in all or most of the commercially available probiotics tested (both gut and oral), based on their genome. Overall, S. salivarius DB-B5 seems to be safe as a candidate probiotic based on both in vitro and in silico results.  
 [0064] Several clinical trials have been performed on the ability of probiotics to prevent or treat oral diseases. Lactobacillus rhamnosus L8020 was used to ferment a yogurt product, which showed significant decrease in oral pathogen levels, compared to a placebo yogurt [1] A combination of L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, normally used as gut probiotics, was delivered in lozenge format to healthy participants, and was shown to be able to reduce plaque index, gingival index, and decrease levels of gingival pathogens [2] Several clinical trials using Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 -containing tablets have been performed, and the probiotic was shown to decrease periodontal conditions, periodontal pathogens, halitosis, and halitosis-associated pathogens [3-5] S. salivarius ll has been shown to reduce halitosis levels when used in conjunction with chlorhexidine, while S. salivarius M18 usage was shown to reduce cariogram outcome in at-risk children [6,7] The above trials indicate that oral probiotics are able to prevent and treat a wide-range of oral diseases, using a variety of delivery formats. The results of this study, thus, indicates that the present oral probiotic strain that can tackle three prevalent oral diseases, e.g. dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis.  
 Example 2 - Sequence analysis of S. salivarius DB-B5  
 [0065] In order to further analyze the present S. salivarius strain, whole-genome sequencing was performed.  
 [0066] S. salivarius DB-B5 was grown on BHI media (Hardy Diagnostics) at 37 °C under 5% 
 CO2. Cells were harvested, and genomic DNA extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Paired-end sequencing libraries (2 x 300 bp) were constructed using the Nextera XT Library Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the MiSeq v3 platform (Illumina) at the Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function (CAGEF) at the University of Toronto. In parallel, DB-B5 genomic DNA was 

also extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega) and sent to Genome Quebec for large insert library preparation and PacBio Sequel sequencing. Illumina reads were quality filtered using Trimmomatic (v0.38.0) (8). Unicycler (v0.4.8.0) was used to perform a de novo hybrid assembly with 1,722,228 Illumina paired-end reads and 629,563 PacBio long reads, with a genome coverage of -lOOOx (9). The complete genome consists of one circular chromosome (2,143,863 bp) with a GC content of 40.2%, one megaplasmid named pIKMIN-B501 (138,497 bp) with a GC content of 35.6%, one small plasmid named pIKMIN-B503 (3,225 bp) with a GC content of 39.6%, and one linear phage like episome named pIKMIN-B502 (57,714 bp) with a GC content of 39.1%. The genome was annotated by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) v4.11 (10). The genome contains a total of 2,041 protein coding genes, 18 complete rRNA genes, 4 non-coding RNA genes (ncRNA), and 68 tRNA genes.  
 [0067] A search of the genome of S. salivarius DB-B5 was conducted to identify bacteriocins using BAGEL4 (http://bagel4.molgenrug.nl/), a web-based genome mining tool for bacteriocins and RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides) (11). The analysis revealed that the strain possesses a thiazolyl peptide (thiopeptide) bacteriocin locus on the megaplasmid pIKMIN- B501, and a blpU bacteriocin locus on the chromosome. The genome sequence of S. salivarius DB-B5 will be useful in further understanding the mechanism of its probiotic properties.  
 [0068] The complete genome sequences have been deposited at GenBank under the accession numbers CP054153 (chromosome), CP054154 (pIKMIN-B501), CP054155 (pIKMIN-B502), and CP054156 (pIKMIN -B 503 ) .  
 [0069] The S. salivarius DB-B5 strain was deposited at The International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC) under accession no. 160720-1 (depositor reference, DOSEBIOSYSTEMS- SS DBB5), on July 16, 2020, in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.  
 Example 3 - Anti-microbial Activity  
 [0070] Overnight cultures of DB-B5 were filter sterilized and the resulting supernatant was passed through a column containing XAD-16 resin. The resin was then washed with 50% methanol and the antimicrobial activity was eluted with a 95% methanol wash to create a crude extract. The crude extract was further purified using a C18 clean-up column and antimicrobial activity was eluted with a 60% methanol elution. The methanol was removed via evaporation and the sample was resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH =6.5). 

[0071] To 100 ul of DB-B5 extract cleaned as described above, proteases (pronase, subtilisin, or 
 Proteinase K) were added at a lmg/mL concentration and various halitosis-causing bacterial cells were incubated in the protease-containing extract for 2 hours at 37 °C. A control with no protease was also incubated with microbial cells. To all samples was added 10 ul of lOx TRIS, CaCl buffer. Protease only controls were also included (protease, 10 ul of lOx Tris, and 100 ul of phosphate buffer), as well as a heat-inactivated sample (100 ul of DB-B5 extract, boiled at 100 °C for 30 minutes).  
 [0072] Soft agar plates were prepared with Schadler’s broth and were allowed to harden. 10 ul of each sample were spotted onto a plate, dried and incubated at 37 °C anaerobically overnight. The DB-B5 extract exhibited inhibition of all bacteria tested in the presence of proteases, indicating that the antimicrobial activity was not protein-dependent as shown in the Table 6 below.  
 Table 6. 
 
 
 * a + indicates a zone of clearing in a soft agar spot assay  
 * a - indicates no zone of clearing in a soft agar spot assay  
 * All proteases were used at a final concentration of lmg/ml  
 [0073] Thus, the active antimicrobial compound against these halitosis-causing bacteria is protease-resistant.  
 Example 4 - Biogenic Amines (BA) Production  
 [0074] S. salivarius DB-B5 was tested for the ability to produce BAs using both an in silico method to detect the presence of genes required for BA production, as well as an in vitro plating method to detect the presence of the BA. In silico results indicated that the genes involved in BA production were not present in the S. salivarius DB-B5 genome as shown in Table 7. 

Table 7. 
 
 
 [0075] The in vitro plating analysis also confirmed this result: S. salivarius DB-B5 and E. coli 
 ATCC 31616 were streaked on decarboxylase media containing different amino acid precursors. S. salivarius growth did not cause a pH color change, whereas E. coli growth caused the decarboxylase media to change to a distinct purple color, indicating the rise of pH to more alkaline conditions due to the presence of biogenic amines.  
 Example 5 - Clinical Study on halitosis  
 [0076] In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, the ability of S. salivarius DB-B5 to reduce halitosis caused by oral bacteria was determined by measuring hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan levels.  
 [0077] Participants consumed DB-B5 powder dissolved in 4 oz of water twice a day (2 billion 
 CFU/day or 10 billion CFU/day). The DB-B5 water was swirled around in the mouth for 15 seconds prior to ingestion. Participants took DB-B5 water twice daily, for 4 weeks.  
 [0078] Hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan levels were measured at baseline and 4 weeks using an OralChroma device. Hydrogen sulfide is a volatile sulfur compound that is associated with halitosis-causing bacteria residing on the dorsum of the tongue, and accounts for about 90% of the cause of halitosis. Methyl mercaptan is a volatile sulfur compound that is associated with periodontal disease- causing bacteria. DB-B5 was able to reduce the levels of hydrogen sulfide in the mouth of healthy participants by about 50%, as well as reduced levels of methyl mercaptan as shown in Table 8.
