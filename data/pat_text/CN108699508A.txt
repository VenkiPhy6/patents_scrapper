At culture medium (glucose 30g/L, corn steep liquor filtration treatment object 30g/L, ammonium sulfate 1.5g/L, potassium dihydrogen phosphate 1.5g/L, phosphorus
Sour disodium hydrogen dodecahydrate 3.8g/L, calcium chloride dihydrate 5.0g/L, magnesium sulfate 7 hydrate 0.7g/L, seven water of ferric sulfate
Closing object 1.0g/L, organic silicon antifoaming agent 0.2g/L) 7.2ml is added the test tube with tampon of internal diameter 18mm and obtains production and try
Pipe culture medium has prepared 9 parts of production Tube propagation bases.Production has been used with the raw material of Tube propagation base has confirmed that thalline is given birth to
The raw material of long insufficient lot number. 
 Cobalt chloride hexahydrate is made an addition to 9 above-mentioned production test tubes respectively in the form of the aqueous solution of 0.8ml so that
Ultimate density be 0,0.0001,0.001,0.005,0.01,0.1,1,5 and 10mg/L (that is, 0,0.00042,0.0042,
0.021,0.042,0.42,4.2,21 and 42 μm of ol/L).Culture medium sodium hydrate aqueous solution or aqueous sulfuric acid adjust to
PH7.2 carries out 20 minutes autoclave sterilizations at 121 DEG C. 
 Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens ATCC are inoculated in seed Tube propagation base for 21588 plants,
2 days shaken cultivations have been carried out with 300spm at 28 DEG C, have then tried the culture solution in 9 kinds of different productions of cobalt concentration respectively
Pipe inoculation of medium 0.05ml has carried out at 28 DEG C with 300spm 4 days shaken cultivations. 
 It is determined using ICP-MS and is not added with the production of the cobalt chloride hexahydrate in addition prepared and is planted in Tube propagation base
Cobalt concentration after son inoculation, result are 0.002 μm of ol/L. 
 After culture in 4 days, the thalli growth of culture solution is determined by OD610, and carotenoid is determined by HPLC
Concentration, show the result in table 12.When cobalt concentration is too low or excessively high, growth and carotenoid production are substantially reduced, in profit
With in the production of the Paracoccus zeaxanthinifaciens zeaxanthins carried out and β-kryptoxanthin, will also realize that the suitable of cobalt
When concentration range is identical as other paracoccus bacteriums.
