 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to a kind of pair of control of plant disease, control of nematode and plant growths to promote useful novel microbial.
The invention further relates to as raw to the tolerance of phytopathogen, control of nematode and plant for improving novel microbial
The use of the long microorganism formulation promoted. 
 
 
 Background technique 
 As the control method for using the plant disease other than existing chemical pesticide, use what is separated from nature
The biological control of microorganism, which receives, attractes attention, and some microbial pesticides realize commercialization.It is well known, however, that micro- life
Object pesticide haves the shortcomings that effect is unstable or applicable disease is few compared with chemical pesticide.Consider from such case, waits in expectation
Have and is newly applicable in disease and shows the novel microbial pesticide of stable control efficiency. 
 As the plant disease controlling agent for using microorganism, Tarlaromyces flavus (Talaromyces flavus) agent, fluorescence are false
Monad (Pseudomonas fluorescens) agent, avirulence carrot soft rot Erwinia (Erwinia
Carotovora) agent, Trichoderma atroviride (Trichoderma atroviride) agent, simple bacillus (Bacillus
Simplex) agent, bacillus subtilis (Bacillus subtilis) agent etc. are registered and are made as microbial pesticide
With. 
 As the control of nematode agent for using microorganism, pasteurellaceae bud bacterium (Pasteuria penetrans) agent, tumor is invaded
Catch genus monacrosporium bacterium (Monacrosporium phymatophagum) agent be registered as microbial pesticide and obtain using. 
 Use, which is disclosed, in No. 2955655 specifications (patent document 1) of Japanese Patent No. belongs to bacillus amyloliquefaciens
The plant disease controlling agent of the bacterium of (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens).The effective component of the plant disease controlling agent
It is the product of microorganism, bacterium itself is not used as pesticide.In addition, not any about plant growth promotion or control of nematode
It records. 
 In addition, disclosing use in No. 5198690 specifications (patent document 2) of Japanese Patent No. belongs to solution starch gemma bar
The plant disease controlling agent of the bacterium of bacterium (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), but with bacterial strain of the invention in classification
It is different. 
 In addition, filiform can be prevented and treated simultaneously by disclosing in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 2009-247302 bulletin (patent document 3)
The effective microbial pesticide of fungal disease and bacterial disease and viable bacteria body itself, but about plant growth promotion or nematode
Prevention and treatment is not recorded. 
 Disclosing use in No. 3471815 specifications of Japanese Patent No. (patent document 4, WO98/050422) can be used in
Extensive plant disease and to the control of plant disease of the effective bacillus of corn rootworm (Corn Rootworm)
Agent, but do not recorded about plant growth promotion or control of nematode. 
 In addition, disclosing and can use in No. 4071036 specifications of Japanese Patent No. (patent document 5, US2004/265292)
In sp.D747 plants of Bacillus of controlling plant diseases and pest control, but promote about plant growth or control of nematode does not have
It records. 
 It discloses in No. 3471811 specifications of Japanese Patent No. (patent document 6, WO96/032840) using bacillus
Belong to the control of nematode agent of bacterium.The effective component of the control of nematode agent is that have the active bacillus firmus of anti-nematode
The bacterium of (Bacillus firmus) strain or spore, but do not recorded about plant growth promotion or controlling plant diseases. 
 In addition, disclosing utilization in No. 4359653 specifications of Japanese Patent No. (patent document 7, WO1997/012980)
The nematode of nematode resistance toxin caused by the neotype strain of bacillus thuringiensis (Bacillus thuringiensis) controls
Method, but do not recorded about plant growth promotion or control of plant disease. 
 On the other hand, agriculturally, chemical fertilizer is the Important Agricultural material having an impact to crop yield, but is made
The 30~50% of chemical fertilizer ingredient not by crops utilize and be diffused into environment, become rivers and creeks eutrophication,
It is lauched the reason of water pollution etc..In addition, will use a large amount of fossil fuel when production chemical fertilizer, the valence with fossil fuel
Lattice are surging to complement each other, and the cost of chemical fertilizer is also increasing.Further, the nitrogen oxides as the decomposition product of nitrogenous fertilizer material
(NO X ) it is considered the greenhouse effects compared with carbon dioxide gas with about 300 times, the worry of global warming is being become
Problem.Additionally, it is contemplated that from now on due to global population increase and inanition, using for improving crop production rate
Material is indispensable, thus replace existing chemical fertilizer, the more and more necessary of more environment-friendly material is mentioned
It is high. 
 It is opposite with these situations, the research in terms of the yield of agriculture crops is improved using edaphon mainly for root
Tumor campylobacter bacteria (rhizobium), pseudomonas bacterium, bacillus carry out extensively, but since its effect is low and
Obtain the few of functionization. 
 As described above, expectation is few not against chemical pesticide and chemical fertilizer, carrying capacity of environment strongly, can carry out plant disease
Prevention and treatment and control of nematode, the microorganism also simultaneously with plant growth promotion.

 By ITB090 (NITE BP-01725), ITB100 (NITE BP-01726), ITB105 (NITE BP-01727),
The mutant strain of ITB117 plants (NITE P-01728) induction refers to: can for example enumerate the natural mutant using them, ultraviolet
The Mutation induction of line irradiation, x-ray bombardment, Mutation induction agent (for example, N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine etc.) etc. is handled
Body, polyploid.Specifically, can properly use be maintained at the homology of 16S rDNA 99.5% or more mutant strain.This
As long as a little mutant strains keep control of plant disease effect, control of nematode effect and plant growth promotion effect, it is included in this hair
Bright microorganism.Herein, control of plant disease effect, control of nematode effect and plant growth promotion effect is kept to refer to, wherein
Any one effect is compared with parental strain, 80% or more. 
 Method for culturing microbes of the invention can be used on solid culture medium known in stationary culture, Liquid Culture etc.
Method does not have about available kinds of culture medium, condition of culture etc. as long as the bacterium of the application can survive and breed
Especially limitation.Such as other than the ordinary culture mediums such as broth bouillon, it can also enumerate and be mentioned containing glucose, peptone, yeast
Take the culture medium etc. of object.In addition, other than fluid nutrient medium, it is possible to use the slant medium containing agar and plate training
Support the solids culture mediums such as base.Spawn incubation can also be divided into be cultivated with two stages of main culture. 
 As the carbon source of culture medium, all substances of (moneyization) can be assimilated using above-mentioned strain, can specifically be enumerated:

 " control of plant disease " in the present invention refers to the effect that the disease of plant is prevented or cured. 
 " prevention plant disease " described here refers in the situation of soil disease, plants in the soil containing pathogen
When may be by the plant of its infection during training is certain, hair of the disease incidence than not applying control agent plant of control agent plant be applied
Sick rate is low.In addition, in the situation of cauline leaf disease, it may be by the plant of its infection in inoculation pathogen and during cultivating centainly
When, the disease incidence for applying control agent plant is lower than the disease incidence for not applying control agent plant.Further, " phytopathy is cured
When evil " refers to the plant during cultivation is certain by disease infection, the occurring degree for applying the plant of control agent is more anti-than not applying
The occurring degree for controlling the plant of agent reduces. 
 " plant disease " in the present invention does not just have as long as microorganism of the invention plays the plant disease of control efficiency
There is special limitation, preferably passes through plant disease, more preferable cauline leaf disease and soil disease caused by pathogenic bacterial infection plant.
