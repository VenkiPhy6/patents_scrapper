 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to the compositions of the bacterium bacterial strain comprising separating from mammalian digestive tract and such composition to exist
The field for treating the purposes in disease. 
 
 
 Background technique 
 Human intestine is considered in uterus being sterile, but it is immediately exposed to various mothers after birth
Body and environmental microorganism.Then, the microorganism that dynamic time section occurs colonizes and multiplies, this is influenced by factor such as below:
Childbirth options, environment, diet and host gene type, all these all influence the composition of intestinal microbiota, in the primordial growth traits phase
Between it is especially true.Then, micropopulation stabilizes and becomes mature [1].Human intestinal microorganisms group is containing more than 1500 kinds
Different phylotype, the main division bacteria of two of them (door) occupy leading position on abundance level: Bacteroidetes and thickness
Wall bacterium door [2].By human intestine bacterial colonization generate successful symbiosis generated various metabolism, structure,
Protectiveness and other beneficial functions.The metabolic activity of the enhancing of the enteron aisle colonized ensures the meals for being otherwise difficult to digest
Food component is degraded with the release of by-product, to provide important nutriment source and other health benefit for host
Place.Similarly, the immunology importance of intestinal microbiota is fully recognized and is illustrated in germfree animal, described sterile
Animal has the compromised immune system [3-5] functionally reconstructed after introducing symbiotic bacteria. 
 The dynamic change of micropopulation composition has had in gastrointestinal disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recorded.For example, shuttle
The level of bacterium (Clostridium) cluster XIVa bacterium reduces in IBD subject, and the quantity of Escherichia coli (E.coli) increases
Add, to show the variation [6-9,18] of enteron aisle endosymbiosis biology and causal organism balance. 
 After recognizing the potential positive effect that certain bacterium bacterial strains may have animal intestinal tract, it has been suggested that various
Bacterial strain is for treating various diseases (see, e.g. [10-13]).Having proposed a variety of bacterial strains (mainly includes lactobacillus
(Lactobacillus) and Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacterium) bacterial strain) for treat various enteropathies (for summary ginseng
See [14], and referring to [15]).Bibliography [16] proposes to use using the bacterial strain of Blaw spy Bordetella (genus Blautia)
In the microbial balance for adjusting the digestion ecosystem.In the context of bibliography 16, adjusting refers to that promotion produces acetic acid bacteria
The activity of damage of the flora for methane phase and sulphur reducing bacteria.Therefore, this document only instructs the increase for producing acetic acid bacteria.No
It is related to belonging to the multifarious discussion of strain of a variety of taxons.Bibliography [17] discuss using Blaw spy Salmonella for improve by
The survival rate for the patient that graft versus host disease (GVDH) influences.It mentions increased Phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and reduced GVDH phase
It is associated to close the death rate, and the increased amount of bacteria of Blaw spy Bordetella is associated with the GVDH of reduction.However, not indicating
The stabilization that Blaw spy Salmonella realizes micropopulation in the multifarious increase of micropopulation and/or induction subject is applied to patient
Property. 
 Relationship and specific bacteria bacterial strain between different bacterium bacterial strain and various disease is for enteron aisle and in systemic water
Flat lower and for any certain types of disease accurate effect do not characterized well, and at present the result is that can be changed
And compared to furnishing an answer, [18] are more led to the problem of. 
 The characteristics of changing relevant many human diseases to micropopulation is the multifarious loss of micropopulation.Such as from so-called
Flora imbalance (compared with the typical aggregation micropopulation in health volunteer, this is only the micropopulation composition changed) it is obvious
Find out, the multifarious loss of micropopulation can pass through division bacteria in sample based on sequence or activity classification unit (OTU)
Measurable reduction of quantity quantifies, and is usually determined by 16S rRNA amplicon PCR sequencing PCR.Multifarious loss is also logical
The reduction of Shannon diversity index (Shannon Diversity Index) or Chao index (Chao index) is crossed to measure.
Reduced micropopulation diversity is in obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal irritable syndrome (IBS), diabetes B and weak
The elderly current research in reported [20].Re-establishing healthy micropopulation may be difficult, because in enteron aisle
Bacterium resist colonize.When attempting micropopulation of the diversity by increasing micropopulation to handle non-health subject,
This can generate challenge [19].The adjoint property of microbial metabolism function lose be considered as these pathophysiological conditions facilitate because
Element.The normal adults stable compared to wherein micropopulation, non-health subject is such as with those of IBD, IBS and weak
The micropopulation of aged subjects is unstable [18,20]. 
 It needs to characterize the latent effect of enteric bacteria, so that the new treatment using enteric bacteria can be developed.

 Fig. 6 A and Fig. 6 B are shown in the variation of health and alternative network in IBS patient after Blautix processing.In health
In individual, alternative network became more dense at the 16th day and interconnects, this shows to compete and inhibits to increase.However, this is acted on
It is lost at the end of research, because network structure returns to initial time point (Fig. 6 A) during scavenging period section.In IBS patient
In, Blautix effect internuncial for alternative is to increase network diameter during processing period and scavenging period section.This
It is opposite to become more dense effect with the network seen in healthy individuals.During the wash phase of IBS patient, observe previously
The multiple independent interactions that do not see.Multiple independent interactions indicate in a manner of the remainder independently of network
The taxon pair of interaction, that is, they do not have any interaction of the remainder for network. 
 After Blautix processing, taxon relevant for certain health exists to be increased the visualization display of micropopulation
The network connectivity (Fig. 7) added.The relevant taxon of health includes fusobacterium cluster IV, Bifidobacterium and melaninogenicus
Belong to.Bactoscilla is also likely to be the relevant category of health.These relevant taxons of health involve the response to processing.

 Protective effect in the model of embodiment 4- neuritic symptom 
 Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is to reflect that human diseases MS's is permitted the small of various CNS inflammation
Mouse model, and EAE is the most-often used experimental model for mankind MS.EAE is also more typically used as CNS specificity itself
Immune disorders [52] and the model for being used for other specific symptom (including Acute Disseminated encephalomyelitis).EAE use is with marrow phosphorus
The booster immunization that lipopeptid and adjuvant carry out induce with cause be closely corresponding to CNS many autoimmunities and inflammatory conditions and
The immune and inflammatory response for the mechanism that especially MS is based on.Show many therapies of effect also in human patients in EAE
Effect [52] are shown in MS treatment.Most of all, EAE reproduces the main feature of MS, including inflammation, demyelinate, axonal loss
And gliosis.The influence of demyelinate is limited primarily to spinal cord in EAE, the change with seldom brain stem and cerebellum.
In EAE, CD4+T cell is the cell colony present in CNS in the highest flight. 
 
 Method 
 
 By hydrogen nutrition Blaw spy Salmonella (" Blautix ", with accession number DSM 10507 and also with accession number DSM 14294
The bacterial strain of preservation) it is used as the powder of freeze-drying and reconstructs as needed. 
 Use 12 Adult female C57BL/6J mouse. 
 The 0th day and the 7th day, MOG35-55 is contained to animal application by subcutaneous injection under gas (isoflurane) anesthesia
Lotion and supplement have the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) of mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra.At the 0th day, two skins are executed in flank
Lower injection；Each one in each lower part quadrant at back.At the 7th day, two subcutaneous injections are executed in flank；At back
Each one in each upper quadrant. 
 The 0th day and the 2nd day, one hundred days for animal being applied in by intraperitoneal injection in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (PBS)
Cough toxin (PTx).At the 0th day, PTx application is executed after MOG application. 
 The processing carried out with Blautix or control was applied from the -14th day according to following timetable: 
 0th day: MOG/CFA, once, SC
