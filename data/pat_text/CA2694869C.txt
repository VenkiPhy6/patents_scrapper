More specifically, the present invention relates to bacterial isolates and methods for detoxifying mycotoxins. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Approximately 25% of the world's food crops are contaminated every year with mycotoxins, creating an ongoing, serious threat to human health and food and livestock industries. Control of mycotoxins is a global challenge due to their high toxicity to animals and humans and their widespread occurrence in agricultural commodities. Trichothecene mycotoxins represent one of the most important mycotoxin classes that comprising naturally occurring metabolites produced primarily by Fusarium but also other species of fungi (Stachybotrys, Myrothecium, and Trichothecium) on a variety of cereal grains. The mycotoxins are known to be associated with several diseases in animals and humans (Ueno, 1983; Miller and Trenholm, 1994; Pittet, 1998;  D'Mello et al., 1999; Placinta et al., 1999; DeVries et al., 2002; Conkova et al., 2003;  Sudakin, 2003;  Eriksen and Pettersson, 2004; Desjardins, 2006). Deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin) is a specific trichothecene mycotoxin which is frequently encountered in human foods.  DON is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F.    culmorum, fungal pathogens causing head blight (scab) of small-grain cereals and ear rot of maize. Annually, about 10 million hectares wheat and 1.4 million hectares maize are seeded in Canada. Accordingly, control of mycotoxin contamination has been one of the major challenges facing the cereal industry. A survey conducted in Eastern Canada during 1991 to 1998 found that maize had the highest incidence of DON contaminated samples (0.1 mg/kg and over), which was 90%, followed by wheat, 82%, and barley 73%. In 2003, DON was detected in 63% of samples obtained from cereal-based infant foods from the Canadian retail market. Many outbreaks of acute human diseases have been attributed to consumption of Fusarium¨contaminated grains and, more recently, to the presence of  
 - 2 -DON at reported concentrations of 3-93 mg/kg in grain for human consumption (Canady et al., 2001). Mycotoxin contamination of feed ingredients also has been a serious threat to livestock industry, particularly swine production. It is well known that consumption of DON-contaminated feed can cause loss of appetite, vomiting, lesions of the intestinal tract and immunosuppression in animals (Eriksen and Pettersson 2004). Weight gain of pigs can be reduced by 5 to 10% with DON levels between 1 and 2 parts per million (ppm) and may be reduced by 50% if toxin levels in consumed feed are in the order of about 5 to 10 ppm (Purdue University; OMAFRA). The current practice to reduce or contain mycotoxin contamination is focused mainly on the prevention of contaminated grain materials from entering the food chain through regulation, detection and compliance. However, since efficient prevention of mycotoxin contamination is not always feasible or practical, various physical, chemical and biological methods have been studied for use in decontamination of grains containing trichothecenes. For example, cleaning methods, such as gravity and sieving separation, dehulling and washing procedures can reduce the concentration of DON in wheat and maize (Trenholm et al., 1992). Thermal treatments by microwave or convection (Young, 1986) also may be used. Chemical detoxification by using oxidants such as ozone and sodium bisulfite (McKenzie, et al., 1997; Young, et al. 1986), reductants such as ascorbic acid (Swanson, et al., 1984) and alkali such as sodium hydroxide (Young et al., 1986) have been investigated. However, such treatments are often expensive, time intensive, lack efficiency, or produce deleterious side effects on the food products.  Further, these methods often are not amenable to large volumes of food products and are generally considered undesirable by food/feed industries and/or consumers. A variety of approaches have been used to reduce mycotoxin effects on livestock industries. The use of adsorbents as feed additives is common. Such adsorbents may include alfalfa fibre, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), bentonite, special types of clay, etc. The use of grains with no or low mycotoxin contamination to dilute mycotoxin level in feed is another common approach. Unfortunately, the use of adsorbents in feeds to remove mycotoxins is not only relatively expensive, but also specific to particular mycotoxins. Some of the most popularly used adsorbents, such as  
 - 3 -hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) and the like, are not effective against DON. Further, the dilution method to reduce mycotoxin contamination by mixing contaminated ingredients with high quality grains is difficult to implement because the degree of contamination is often not known and thus there are questions about the extent of dilution needed to reach contamination levels which would be considered acceptable.  Some European countries have already banned the use of this procedure. Despite a plethora of information regarding the biochemistry, toxicity, and modes of action of mycotoxins, there still remain no viable solutions for either pre-or post- harvest control/eradication of these toxins (Cardwell et al., 2001). In developed countries, substantial costs are incurred through testing, compliance and research to prevent entrance of mycotoxins into the food chain. In the United States these costs are estimated to be about US$500 million to $1.5 billion per year (CAST, 1989). In Canada, losses of $100 million were accrued in 1996 following a Fusarium epidemic in Ontario (Schaafsma, 2002). Today, the livestock feed industry is facing an even greater challenge due to the increased incidence of Fusarium ear rot of corn and the competition for corn from the emerging biofuel industry. One way in which both the biofuel industry and the livestock industry have been able to make synergistic use of the limited amount of corn available, is for the livestock industry to use the by-products created from the biofuel industry as a protein source to feed animals. However, ethanol fermentation does not destroy mycotoxins, such as DON, but, in fact, concentrates the levels to be 2 to 3 times higher than the starting material, which poses a serious risk to the livestock fed these by-products. There is a need in the art for novel products and methods for mycotoxin control and/or decontamination. Further, there is a need in the art for specific, efficient and environmentally sound ways for decontamination/detoxification of mycotoxins.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following description is of a preferred embodiment. Provided herein is the isolation and identification of microorganisms capable of detoxifying trichothecene mycotoxins to less toxic products, for example, but not limited  
 - 7 -to, detoxification of vomitoxin (4-deoxynivalenol or DON) to the less toxic product de-epoxy-vomitoxin (DOM or DOM-1). Detoxification of trichothecene mycotoxins such as vomitoxin may occur by one or more routes, for example, but not limited to de-epoxidation. The epoxide ring of trichothecenes is responsible for their toxicity and de-epoxidation can result in a significant loss of toxicity (Eriksen and Pettersson 2004). According to the present invention there is provided a bacterial isolate defined by accession number 180507-1 filed with the International Depository Authority of Canada (IDC) on May 18th, 2007. Bacteria from the isolate exhibit mycotoxin detoxifying activity, for example, but not limited to vomitoxin (DON) detoxification activity. The present invention also provides a composition comprising bacteria as defined by IDAC accession number 180507-1 and a carrier. By the term "carrier" it is meant a liquid, solid, liquid-solid or semi-solid substrate or medium for holding/retaining, suspending, diluting, adhering, enveloping, culturing, growing, proliferating, freezing/cryopreserving or any combination thereof, the bacteria as defined above. For example, but not to be considered limiting in any manner, the carrier may comprise a culture medium, such as, without limitation, L10 or another suitable medium as would be known in the art. Other carriers including culture media and the like as would be evident to a person of skill in the art are also meant to be encompassed by the term "carrier" as used herein.  In a preferred embodiment, the carrier does not substantially affect the detoxification ability of the bacteria in association therewith. It is also contemplated that the carrier also may comprise a food, food product or a combination of food or food products. By the phrase "food or food products" it is meant any food/feed or combination of foods/feeds, either in natural, harvested or processed form for human and/or animal consumption. The phrase "food or food product"  also includes a by-product from a process which can later be used as a primary source of food or a product added to a food or diet. Any food or food product that comprises trichothecene mycotoxins, that is capable of being contaminated by trichothecene mycotoxins or that is susceptible to infection by microorganisms producing trichothecene mycotoxins are specifically included as food or food products herein.  Representative examples of foods or food products include without limitation cereals for example, but not limited to corn, barley, rice, wheat, oats, sorghum, rye or mixtures thereof.

In a preferred embodiment the food or food product is contaminated or susceptible to contamination by deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin) or microorganisms that are capable of producing deoxynivalenol. Similarly, there is contemplated a food or food product that comprises bacteria defined by accession number 180507-1 or that is treated to comprise the bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1. It is also contemplated that the carrier may also comprise a crop or harvested crop, which may or may not include plants that act as food for humans or animals. For example, plants grown for economic purposes, including for use in textiles, are encompassed by the phrase "crop or harvested crop". By definition, the phrase "crop or harvested crop" the plant can be either in the ground growing or has been harvested. Any crop or harvested crop that comprises trichothecene mycotoxins, that is capable of being contaminated by trichothecene mycotoxins or that is susceptible to infection by microorganisms producing trichothecene mycotoxins are specifically included as crop or harvested crop herein.  Representative examples of crops or harvested crops include without limitation tobacco, switchgrass, jute, cotton and hemp. Accordingly, there is provided a composition comprising bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1 and a carrier, wherein the carrier is crop or harvested crop. In a preferred embodiment the crop or harvested crop is contaminated or susceptible to contamination by deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin) or microorganisms that are capable of producing deoxynivalenol. Similarly, there is contemplated a crop or harvested crop that comprises bacteria defined by accession number 180507-1 or that is treated to comprise the bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1. The present invention also provides a method of reducing mycotoxin contamination in a food, food product, crop or harvested crop by treating the food, food product, crop or harvested crop with bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1 or a composition comprising bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1. In a preferred embodiment, the mycotoxins comprise trichothecene mycotoxins, more preferably deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin).  
 - 9 -The present invention also provides a method of preventing mycotoxin contamination in a food, food product, crop or harvested crop by treating the food, food product, crop or harvested crop with bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1 or a composition comprising bacteria as defined by accession number 180507-1. In a preferred embodiment, the mycotoxins comprise trichothecene mycotoxins, more preferably deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin). Also contemplated by the present invention is a kit comprising bacteria as defined by accession number 180207-1 and one or more of the following: a) one or more carriers; b) one or more devices for combining or formulating the bacteria with the one or more carriers of a); c) one or more devices for treating a food or food product with the bacteria or a composition comprising the bacteria as defined above, and; d) instructions for growing the bacteria, formulating the bacteria with the one or more carriers, using one or more devices for treating a food or food product, or a combination thereof. It is to be understood that the bacteria as defined in above may be combined with the one or more carriers as defined in a) or the two may be separate. Also possible is a kit that comprises bacteria or metabolites thereform, bacteria and carrier, and carrier as three or more separate components. The present invention will be further illustrated in the following examples.  Examples EXAMPLE 1: Detoxification of Deoxynivalenol with Bio-Transforming Microorganisms Deoxynivalenol (DON) or vomitoxin can be transformed to a much (several hundred times) less toxic compound, de-epoxy vomitoxin (DOM-1 or DOM) by microorganisms (Fig. 1). The contents from the large intestine of chickens was able to detoxify vomitoxin  
 - 10 -by converting DON (either as a pure chemical or in contaminated grains) to DOM-1, while contents from other gut regions showed little or no activity. Table 1 shows the ability of different species of chicken to convert DON to DOM-1. The White Leghorn hens were much more efficient at converting DON to DOM-1 than were Isa Brown hens.  The detoxification appeared to be biological since autoclaved large intestinal samples showed no activity of detoxification. Detoxification of vomitoxin in contaminated grains was also examined at different incubation temperatures. Although the conversion rate was slightly higher at 30 C, incubation at both 30  C and 37 C was able to convert DON  to DOM-1 in contaminated wheat and corn (Table 2). Table 1. Effect of individual hen* Conversion Rate Breed              Hen (A) Isa Brown White Leghorn      2 * Incubation of the chicken large intestinal contents with DON (a pure chemical) at 30  C for 96 hr in an anaerobic medium. Table 2. Effects of the DON source and incubation temperature* Conversion Rate (%) Temperature Wheat                                  Corn * Incubation of the chicken large intestinal contents with DON  (in contaminated grains) in an anaerobic medium for 96 hr. This data suggests that chicken gut comprises microbes that can detoxify vomitoxin.  Further, different breeds of hens show different capacities for detoxification of vomitoxin.  
 -11 -Example 2: Detoxification of DON with Bio-Transforming Microorganisms Digesta were collected from crop, small intestine and large intestine of Leghorn hens raised with feeds mixed with clean and contaminated wheat containing 0 or 10 ppm DON, respectively. The digesta were added either directly or after being autoclaved, to a medium containing purified DON. The resulting mixtures were incubated for 0, 24 and 72 hours and subcultured for six generations at 37 C before being processed for chemical analysis. The extent of transformation of DON to DOM-1 was determined by using a Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Data presented in Figure 2 showed that, compared to the non-DON control, digesta of the large intestine from chickens fed with contaminated wheat were more effective in transforming DON. Without wishing to be bound by theory or limiting in any manner, this may have resulted from increased population and/or improved efficacy of the active microorganisms in the chicken gut. The data also indicated that gut microorganisms acted rather quickly and in the assay conducted, could transform all DON to DOM  within 24 hours. When digesta of large intestine were cultured in an artificial medium, the effectiveness of DON transformation was still high after the 2nd subculture, but significantly declined at the third subculture (Figure 3). Two out of four samples of small intestine showed substantial DON  transformation activity although not all samples had activity. The results suggest that the microflora of the small intestine                                           is much less complex than that of the large intestine    (Figure 4). Only one out of four samples from chicken crop had some DON detoxification activity. EXAMPLE 3: Identification/Isolation of bacterial isolate 18027-1 (IDAC) Testing of a plurality of bacterial isolates, derived from various digestive regions of several chickens revealed that a variety of bacterial strains exist with differing abilities to detoxify tichothecene mycotoxins. Extensive screening allowed for the identification of a particular strain of bacteria with substantial trichothecene mycotoxin detoxifying  
 - 12 -activity. Characteristics of the bacterial isolate (termed bacterial isolate (IDAC) is described below. Genomic DNA of the bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) was extracted with QIAGEN    DNeasy Tissue Kit and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR using eubacterial primers F8 (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') (SEQ ID NO:1) and R1541 (5' -AAGGAGGTGATCCAAGCC-3') (SEQ ID NO:2) . PCR products were directly sequenced using primer 16S1100r (5'-AGGGTTGCGCTCGTTG-3') (SEQ ID NO:3).  Partial 16S rRNA sequences corresponding to Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene bases 300 to 1050 were compared with the GenBank, EMBI, and DBJI nonredundant nucleotide databases using BLAST. The resulting 16S rRNA gene (SEQ ID NO:4) from bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) had 96% sequence similarity to four separate strains from the Bacillus genus (Table 3). Table 3 Sequence similarity of 16S rRNA gene from bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) GenBank Accession # Similarity (%) Bacillus senegalensis strain R56          AF519466.1    96 Bacillus niacini strain YM1C7             EU221338.1    96 Bacillus novalis strain LMG 21837 AJ542512.1          96 Bacillus drentensis strain WN575 DQ275176.1           96 Bacterial isolate 180507-1 grows in an environment between 15 C and 55 C and pH of 4 to 10, preferably between 37 C and 42 C and a pH of 6 to 8. The environmental requirements for growth, in terms of temperature and pH, is similar to other species of the Bacillus genus. However, comparatively the colony size of bacterial isolate (IDAC) is smaller, less spreading and capable of anaerobic growth compared to other species from the genus. As shown in Table 4, bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) is sensitive to vancomysin;  cannot grow on MacConkey agar; does not release DNA when exposed to potassium  
 - 13 -hydroxide; and turns purple when Gram stained, which are all characteristic of a gram-positive bacteria. Table 4 Gram reactivity of bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) Test                        Reaction       Gram Reactivity Gram stain                  Purple         Positive 3% KOH                      No DNA release Positive Vancomysin (5 1.1g/disc)    Sensitive      Positive Growth on MacConkey agar No                Positive It was observed through microscopic examination that bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) is motile, has slightly curved, round ended rods, occurs singly, in pairs and occasionally in longer filaments. From a macroscopic examination following the growth on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA), bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) colonies are slightly irregular in shape, raised in elevation, with undulated margins and have a rough grainy textured surface (Table 5). After one day on TSA, colonies were 2-2.5 mm in diameter and cream-coloured. This morphology is typical of a strain of the Bacillus genus. The bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) was shown to have a catalase enzyme and was able to decompose 3% hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen (Table 5). The presence of a catalase capable of decomposing 3% hydrogen is typical of Bacillus. The fatty acid profile of bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) is unique when compared to the four strains that were shown to have similar 16S rRNA gene sequences, namely B.  subtilis, B. niacini, B. drentensis and B. novalis (Table 5).  
 - 14 -Table 5 Summary of biochemical analysis Test                     Result Catalase                 Positive Morphology on TSA/BP Typical Bacillus 16S rRNA sequence        Bacillus Fatty acid profile       Unique compared to 4 reference Bacillus strains Fatty acid utilization    Unidentified Bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) profile indicates that it is a previously unidentified Bacillus gram-positive strain. Consistency of isolate 180507-1 (IDAC): Isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) was sub-cultured 6 times or passages in L10 medium (Caldwell and Bryant, 1966) with100  g/m1DON, and gave 100% of DON to DOM transformation each time when tested under the assay conditions. After an additional 3 sub-culturing steps in medium without DON, the isolate still showed high activity in the assay and was capable of transforming DON to DOM at the 10th subculture. This indicates that the DON to DOM detoxification activity of isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) is stable. To examine stability of the bio-transformation activity, the isolate was sub-cultured six times in L10 medium with 100 ppm DON therein. At the end of each sub-culturing passage, DON or DOM was analyzed. Three hundred  1 of the bacterium culture were added to 2700  I of L10 medium plus DON, and incubated at 37 C for 72 hours in an anaerobic atmosphere with 95% CO2 and 5% H2. This is defined as one sub-culture or one generation. To determine whether the activity is stable in the sub-culturing without DON in the medium, the isolate was sub-cultured 3 additional times in the medium without DON. At the tenth sub-culturing step, 100 ppm DON was added into the medium and DON or DOM was analyzed. DON was completely transformed into DOM at the tenth sub-culturing.  
 - 15 -Initial concentration of isolate 180507-1 (IDAC): A culture of isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) was grown in L10 medium at 37 C for 24 hours and diluted serially with the same medium into final concentrations from 101 - 108 cells/ml and 100 pg/m1 DON was added to each dilution. After 24-hour incubation at 37 C, samples were taken from each of the dilutions for analyzing de-epoxidation activity and for measuring cell concentrations. The results showed that under the conditions tested, isolate 180507-1 (IDAC) can completely transform DON into DOM within 24-hours when initial cell concentrations are equal to or greater than 105 cells/ml. Effects of DON concentrations on efficacy of isolate 180507-1 (IDAC): When the initial cell concentration was 108 cells /ml in L10 medium, 100%, 100% and 48% of DON  was transformed into DOM after 12-hour incubation at 37 C, as the initial concentrations of DON were 100, 200 and 1000 pg/ml, respectively. However, 100% transformation of DON into DOM was achieved in the treatment with 1000  g/ml in a 24-hour incubation period. Efficiency of isolate 180507-1 (IDAC): Effects of initial cell concentration, duration of incubation, and DON concentration on efficacy of the bacterial isolate in transforming DON to DOM were carefully assessed and adequately described by a polynomial regression model: DON to DOM (%) = -783.228 + 165.854c + 24.895d - 0.049DON - 7.794c2 -2.214cd -0.185d2 + 0.000556*c*DON + 0.0000692*d*DON + 0.000109*DON2 (R2=0.991; where c is initial cell concentration, d is duration of incubation, DON is the concentration of DON). The minimum requirement of initial cell concentrations and duration of incubation for a complete transformation of DON to DOM with 200 1.1g/m1 DON initial concentration has been predicted based on the regression equation (see Table 6).  
 - 16 -Table 6. Conversion of DON (200 g/m1) to DOM (%) Initial Cell Concentration (Log cfu/ml) Incubation 4         5         6          7         8 Period (it) 40        98.9 The results provided herein show that bacterial isolate 180507-1 (TDAC) derived from the chicken gut possesses the ability to transform trichothecene mycotoxins, for example, but not limited to vomitoxin to its de-epoxided form, resulting in significant reduction in toxicity. Degradation of trichothecenes other than DON: Degradation of trichothecenes other than DON was performed as described previously in Young, J.C., Zhou, T., Yu, H., Zhu, H., Gong, J., Degradation of Trichothecene Mycotoxins by Chicken Intestinal Microbes, Food and Chemical Toxicology (2007) 45: 136-143. The selected isolate also degraded eleven trichothecene mycotoxins, including 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 4-diacetoxyscirpenol, fusarenon X, HT-2 toxin, 15-monoacetoxyscitpenol, neosolaniol, nivalenol, T2 toxin, T-2 triol and verrucarol. Without wishing to be bound by theory or limiting in any manner, the resulting degradation occurred either by deepoxidation and/or deacylation. The route depends upon the presence and position of acyl functionalities and other molecular structures of the mycotoxins.  
 - 17 -EXAMPLE 4: Biological effects of DON-contaminated corn consumption in swine Seven pigs were assigned to the control group and seven pigs were assigned to the test group. Both groups were subjected to a 9-day pre-trial diet which consisted of a base diet containing 68.38% corn + wheat + barley, 27% soy meal and 4.62% mineral and vitamin supplement. The test animals were then placed on a moldy corn diet for 9 days.  The moldy corn was pretreated by autoclaving and assayed for DON concentration prior to addition to the base diet. Four kilograms of moldy corn having an average DON  concentration of 124 ppm were mixed with 105 kg of base diet to give a 5 ppm DON  diet. For the same period of time, control pigs were fed a basal diet that was supplemented with clean (no detectable amount of DON) corn in the same amount as the moldy corn (4 kg to 105 kg base diet). Following the trail period, both groups were once again placed on the basal diet for a further 11 days. As shown in Table 7, swine that were fed the moldy corn diet for the trial period showed a significant decrease in average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (gain:feed) compared to those swine on the clean corn diet.  Once the moldy corn was removed from the test animals' diet, they quickly began to consume food in amounts similar to the control animals. Similarly, their average daily weight gain and feeding efficiency rebounded to levels observed in the control animals.

Serum samples were tested for total protein, albumin, globulin, glucose, betahydroxybutane, haptoglobin, urea, cholesterol, creatinine, bilirubin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium chloride, and activities of alkaline phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), and creatine kinase. The haematological and biochemical values were within normal limits, even when differences occurred among groups. As shown in Table 8, statistically significant differences were measured between the control and the DON-contaminated fed group with respect to the amount of urea, GLDH, total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin in the blood.

In particular, 100 grams of autoclaved (121 C, 15 mm) moldy corn per 250 mL bottle was mixed with 50 mL    anaerobic culture medium, 175 ml Na2C034-120 (0.4% to bring the pH to 10.6) and 25 mL  180507-1 (IDAC) cell culture (4 x 109 CFU m1-1) and incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 72 hours at 37 C. Similarly, clean corn was treated in the same manner to control for any biological effects brought on by bacterial isolate 180507-1 (IDAC). The treatment schedule was identical to the schedule described in Example 4.  In addition to the control group and the DON-contaminated diet group described in Example 4, a group of seven swine were fed the bacterial isolate 180507-1 treated moldy corn diet during the toxin period and another seven swine were fed the bacterial isolate clean corn diet during the same period. As shown in Table 9, the average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency (gain:feed) of pigs fed the bacterial isolate 180507-1 treated moldy corn diet were significantly different from those animals fed the DON-contaminated feed.  
 - 21 -Swine fed clean corn and bacterial isolate 180507-1 clean corn during the toxin period had similar feed consumption, weight gain, and feed efficiency, suggesting that the bacterial isolate 180507-1 did not yield any compounds toxic to the pig or affected palatability of the feed.
