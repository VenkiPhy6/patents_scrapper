 FUSION PARTNER 
 TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a new method for the production of recombinant proteins using novel fusion partners. 
 BACKGROUND ART 
 At the advent of new technologies of genetic recombination, biologically useful proteins have been produced utilizing prokaryotes (Escherichia coli), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and cells of higher organisms. These recombinant proteins are widely used in the biotechnology industries for therapeutics and other biologicals for various purposes, hi particular, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most preferred host cells for recombinant protein production due to the fast growth rate and the well-defined molecular biology. 
 The protein production systems using E. coli have an excellent economic efficiency in view of the cost, equipments and process operations, but they have one major problem in which a majority of foreign proteins are produced inside the cell as inactive Inclusion Body (IB) and require a refolding process to obtain an active folded structure. In order to obtain an active form from the BB, the IB should be solubilized in a high concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) or urea, and then refolded into the native structure using methods such as dilution, etc. The refolding mechanism is not well understood and the refolding process of each protein depends on the inherent and unique characteristics of proteins themselves. This inherent problem is the cause of low yield, high production cost, and prolonging time [Lilie, H. et al. (1998) Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9, 497-501], and it is difficult or impossible to refold a majority of high molecular weight proteins, which is an obstacle to industrial applications of the proteins. 
 The formation of IB is characterized by a competition of intramolecular folding rate and intermolecular aggregation, hi case where intramolecular folding rate is slower than the rate of intermolecular aggregation, aggregates in the form of IB are formed [Mitraki, A. & King, J. (1989) Bio/Technology 7, 690-697]. 
 The present invention is to use specific peptide sequences of 30% or higher ratio of negative charges as fusion partners to prevent the formation of aggregates, hence to obtain correctly folded soluble form. The aggregation of folding intermediates is effectively inhibited by the intermolecular repulsion between the negative charges existing in the 

 fusion partners, thereby dramatic improvement of producing native proteins can be achieved. 
 When the fusion partners of this invention are applied to the manufacturing process of insulin, formation of EB has been effectively eliminated and native insulin has been produced after a simple oxidation in buffer solution. 
 Human insulin is currently produced either in E. coli or in yeast using recombinant technology [Frank, B.H et al. (1981) In : Peptides : Synthesis-Structure-function (ed. Rich, D.H. Gross, E.) pp. 729-738, Proceedings of the Seventh American Peptide Symposium, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL.; Thim, L. et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 6766-6770; Markussen, J. et al (1987) Protein Engineering 1, 205-213] 
 The production of human insulin in E. coli uses either proinsulin (PI) [Frank, B.H et al. (1981) In : Peptides : Synthesis-Structure-function (ed. Rich, D.H. Gross, E.) pp. 729- 738, Proceedings of the Seventh American Peptide Symposium, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL.] or miniproinsulin (mini-PI) [Chang, S.-G. et al. (1998) Biochem J. 329, 631- 635] as a precursor. First, PI or mini-PI in the form of fusion protein is produced as IB, and then the IB are solubilized in denaturing agents such as urea or GdnHCl. The PI or mini-PI as a sulfonated form is isolated from the fusion protein by means of cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage, sulfonation and purification steps. The sulfonated PI or mini-PI is refolded into the native form, and the insulin is produced by treatment of trypsin and carboxypeptidase B followed by several purification steps. Refolding yield of PI or mini-PI is greatly influenced by the concentration of the refolding proteins, showing lower yields at higher concentrations. The downstream process including solubilization, CNBr cleavage and sulfonation takes up most of expenditures leading to high cost of production. The CNBr cleavage in particular results in a 50-60% poor production yield and is recognized as a technology to overcome. 
 A method of reducing the process steps after fermentation is to use yeast cells, in which insulin is produced through a series of downstream process (enzymatic reaction, acid hydrolysis, isolation and purification) after extracellular secretion of a single chain insulin derivative. The production yield is low, but the yeast system makes purification step easier and does not require refolding steps, a difficult process experienced in the prokaryotes [Thim, L. et al. (1986) Proc. Natl, Acad. Sd, USA 83, 6766-6770]. 
 Therefore, the combination of high expression level of E. coli with elimination of cumbersome refolding process envisaged in yeast system would be an excellent choice for the manufacturing process of insulin.

 glutamic acid residues. Two negative control groups are chosen for comparison to prove validity of this invention. One is fusion partners(P12 to P14) of the same size, but with reduced negative charge on the one hand, and the other fusion partners of the same charge (ratio of negative charge exceeds 30%), but with shorter peptide length (P15 to P17) of the fusion partners on the other hand.

 Hongje-1-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea) on October 12, 2005 under an accession number of KCCM-10684P according to the Budapest Convention. 
 Example 3: Culture of E. coli transformants and PxPI expression The E. coli strain transformed with the recombinant expression vector pVEX-PxPI of the above mentioned Example 1 was inoculated and cultured in LB liquid culture medium (tryptone 1Og, yeast extract 1Og, and NaCl 5g in 1 liter) containing ampicillin (50-100 μg/ml) or ampicillin and chloramphenicol (38~50 βg/ml each). 
 The recombinant E. coli strains were cultured in the solid medium containing the same components as in the liquid medium, and the resultant colonies were cultured for 12 hours in 1 ml of a liquid medium containing ampicillin (50-100 μg/vd) or ampicillin and chloramphenicol (38-50 βg/ml), and then the culture broth was suspended in 15% glycerol and kept at -70  ° C for future use. The recombinant E. coli strains stored at -70  ° C were spread on the solid culture medium of the same composition as in above and cultured at 37  ° C for 16-18 hours. The resulting colonies were inoculated to 20 ml of liquid medium and cultured at 37  ° C while stirring at a rotary speed of 200 rpm. Upon completion of cultivation for 16-17 hours the resultant culture broth was inoculated to 400 ml of liquid medium and cultured at 37  ° C, pH 7.0 while stirring at a rotary speed of 200 rpm. When the recombinant E. coli strains were grown to an optical density of 0.4-0.6 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (DPTG) was added to the culture broth to a final concentration of 0.5-1.OmM, and the culture broth was further cultured for 4 hours at 20-25  ° C while stirring at a rotary speed of 200 rpm to induce expression of fusion proteins. The resultant culture broth was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm to obtain E. coli pellets, and the pellets were suspended in 20 \\\l of 50 mM Tris buffer and 50 mM glycine buffer solution (pH 8.0-10.0) and then lysed by ultrasonication. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4  ° C to separate supernatant from pellet, and then the amounts of fusion proteins partitioned in soluble and insoluble fractions were determined on SDS-PAGE. As a result, a majority of the PxPI fusion proteins were overexpressed in a soluble form, while most of negative control group were expressed as insoluble precipitate (see Figure 2 and Table 1).

 Example 4: Insulin production from PxPI 
 The lysed E. coli cell suspension prepared by ultrasonication in Example 3 was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, for 10 minutes at 4  ° C to separate the supernatant and the pellet. After cysteine and cystine (0~3 mM of cysteine and l~10 mM of cystine) were added to the supernatant and the solution was allowed to react for 15 hours at room temperature, trypsin and carboxypeptidase B were added to the solution so that the final concentration maintains at the ratio of PxPI:trypsin = 500:1 and PxPLcarboxypeptidase B = 300:1. The pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 8.0 and the reaction was carried out at 15  ° C . During the enzymatic treatment, the sample was taken at a given interval and analyzed by the reverse phase HPLC using analytical C8 column at 280 nm (Figure 3). 
 Example 5: Comparison between the sample insulin made from PxPI and commercial insulin The sample insulin purified in Example 4 was compared with the commercial insulin 
 (humulin) . 

 Example 5-1: Reverse phase HPLC and Mass spectroscopy 
 It was confirmed that the sample insulin prepared by this invention is identical to the commercial insulin (humulin) by the reverse phase HPLC using analytical C8 column 
 (Figure 4). According to the mass analysis, the sample insulin prepared by this invention has molecular weight of 5806.43±0.6Da, which is identical to the theoretical value of 
 5807.19Da within the error range (Fig.5). 
 Example 5-2: Measurement of insulin activity 
 In order to measure the insulin activity prepared in Example 4, 8 weeks-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with 200~250 g body weight were given a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 ml/100 g of body weight of insulin which was dissolved in phosphate buffer (8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na 2 HPO 4  and 0.24 g NaH 2 PO 4 ) at a concentration of 
 4-80 μg/0.1 ml Blood samples were taken from the tail vein at the interval of 30 min., 1, 2, 
 3, and 4 hours, and the hypoglycemic effects, presented as the ED 50  values, were determined (Table 2). The ED 50  values represent the dose of the insulin that gives half the maximum hypoglycemic activity at 1 or 2 hours after subcutaneous administration.

 The soluble part of expressed P3hGCSF was purified on Q-Sepharose anion- exchange column (GE Healthcare Bioscience) using 30 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0 with a linear gradient of 0 ~ 1 M NaCl. Enterokinase (EKL) was added to the purified P3hGCSF to a final ratio of P3hGSCF:EKL = 50: 1, and the mixture was reacted for 24 hours at 37  ° C to isolate hGCSF. The isolated hGCSF was then purified on a Q-Sepharose anionic exchange column in a manner same as above. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the purity of hGCSF (Figure 7). 
 Overall production yield starting from LB liquid culture to the final Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography was about 30 % and ~8 mg of hGCSF was obtained from 1 liter of LB culture.
