 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to detoxified and immunologically active proteins ("mutant LTs"), more specifically, to mutant LTs having mutated amino acid sequences of heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli , DNA sequences encoding the mutant LTs, recombinant expression vectors comprising the DNAs, recombinant microorganisms transformed with the recombinant expression vectors, process for preparing the mutant LTs and pharmaceutical application of the said proteins as immunogenic antigens for vaccination and as adjuvants for antibody production. 
 Description of the Prior Art 
 Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ("ETEC") strain causes diarrheal disease in humans and animals due to production of toxin such as heat-labile enterotoxin ("LT") (see: Spangler, B.D., Microbiol. Rev., 56:622-647(1992)). LT is a multimeric protein composed of two functionally distinct domains: an enzymatically active A subunit ("LTA") of -30, OOOdaltons with ADP-ribosylating activity, and a pentameric B subunit ("LTB") of -11, 600daltons that contains GM1 (momosialoganglioside) receptor-binding site(≤£e_: Backstrόm, M. et al., Mol. Microbiol., 24:489-497(1997)). Upon thiol reduction, the A subunit dissociates into two polypeptide chains, i.e., Al(Mr, 23,000 daltons) and A2 (Mr, 6, OOOdaltons) s e. : Tsuji, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. , 260:8552-8558(1985); Grant C.C.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 62:4270-4278(1994)). The Al subunit, in particular, intoxicates eucaryotic cells by 

catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of Gs, a GTP-binding protein that regulates the levels of the second messenger cAMP (see: Guerrant, R.L. et al., Infect. Immun., 10:320-327(1974); Field, M. et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 321:800-806(1989)). The resulting increase in cAMP level causes secretion of water and electrolytes into the small intestine through interaction with two cAMP-sensitive ion transport mechanisms including (i) NaCl co-transport across the brush border of villous epithelial cells and (ii) electrogenic Na + -dependent Cl "  secretion by crypt cells (.s_e_e_: Guidry, J.J. et al., Infect. Immun., 65:4943-4950(1997)). 
 Both the cholera toxin ("CT") from Vijrio cholerae and heat-labile enterotoxin from ETEC belong to the most potent mucosal adjuvants and immunogens known to date by oral and other mucosal routes, via which most of antigens are unable to induce immune responses (see: Jackson, R.J. et al., Infect. Immun., 61:4272-4279(1993); Takahashi, I. et al., J. Infect. Dis., 173:627-635(1996)). However, their toxicities have precluded their clinical use in humans (see : Douce, G. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 92:1644-1648(1995)). One approach to overcome the problem of toxicity is the generation of genetically detoxified derivatives of LT (see: Lobet, Y. et al., Infect. Immun., 59:2870-2879(1991); Dickson, B.L. and Clements, J.D., Infect. Immun., 63:1617- 1623(1995)) and CT(≤e_e_: Fontana, M.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 63:2356-2360(1995); Yamamoto, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 94 : 5267-5272 (1997b) ) by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids which are located on the β- strand that constitutes the 'floor' of NAD-binding cavity. The most important factor for immunogenicity is shown to be the ability to bind to the receptor on eucaryotic cell(s_e_e_: Nashar, T.O. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 93:226-230(1996)). In fact, a non-binding mutant of the B subunit of LT was found to be non-immunogenic (see : Guidry, J.J. et al., Infect. Immun., 65:4943-4950(1997)). In addition, another group found that the ADP-ribosylating activity is unnecessary for immunogenicity because nontoxic 

derivatives of LT obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the A subunit retained the immunological properties of the wild-type LT(s_e_e_: Pizza, M. et al., J. Exp. Med. , 180:2147- 2153(1994) ) . The attempt to define the role of ADP-ribosylating activity in adjuvanticity of LT has generated conflicting results. For example, it was reported that a nontoxic derivative of LT(LTE112K) when co-administered with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) by an oral route in mice, lacked the adjuvant properties, thus suggesting that the adjuvanticity of LT is linked to its ADP-ribosylating activity (s_£e_: Lycke, N. et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 22:2277-2281(1992)). However, more recently, the adjuvant activity of the LTE112K was found to be identical to that of the LT holotoxin when delivered with influenza virus surface antigen by an intranasal route (see: Verweij, W.R et al., Vaccine, 16:2069-2076(1998)). On the other hand, other investigators showed that another LT derivatives, LTK63, lacking enzymatic activity and toxicity was still able to elicit antibody responses against the co-administered antigen in mice immunized orally, intranasally, or intravaginally (see Di Tom aso, A. et al., Infect. Immun., 64:974-979(1996) Giuliani, M.M. et al., J. Exp. Med., 187:1123-1132(1998) Marchetti, M. et al., Vaccine, 16:33-37(1998)). Under the circumstances, the present inventors, based on the findings that detoxified LT derivatives may induce antibody responses, tried to explore an efficient immunogenic antigen and mucosal adjuvant for vaccination, which can be applied for the development of a mucosal vaccine as well as a novel diarrheal vaccine for humans and animals. 
 SUMMARY OF THF. INVENTION 
 In accordance with the present invention, the inventors have made an effort to develop detoxified and immunologically active proteins ("mutant LTs") by the site- 

directed mutagenesis of heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) of E. coli .

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 The present inventors first isolated a DNA fragment including heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) gene from enterotoxigenic E. coli K88ac strain of porcine origin and thus cloned into pBluescript KS(-) vector to generate pBlueKS-/rLT for site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on single-stranded DNA of pBlueKS-/rLT vector. As a result, two vectors that have mutated DNA sequences encoding amino acids of proposed ADP- ribosyltransferase active center of LT were generated: the first one is 'pBlueKS-ZLTSδSY' wherein serine residue at position 63 of LT is substituted with tyrosine; and, the other one is  x pBlueKS-/LT.i110/112' wherein glutamic acid residues at positions 110 and 112 are deleted. Amino acids at positions 58 to 72 are shown to be folded in a β-strand followed by α-helix, which form the NAD-binding site and amino acids Arg 7 , His 44 , Ser 61  Glu 110  and Glu 112  have been shown to be important for enzymatic activity. Up to date, the modified residues of the LTA subunit are Arg 7 , Ser 63 , Glu 110 , Glu 112  or Ala 72 . 
 The inventors have substituted Ser 63 , the essential amino acid for NAD-binding and catalytic activity of LT, with Tyr residue having a bulky side chain of phenolic ring. Thus, it was expected to efficiently block NAD-binding in slightly modified LT structure. The inventors have also deleted Glu 110  and Glu 112  in LTA subunit which are important for enzymatic activity, and have studied for immunogenicity to LT itself and immune-eliciting property against coadministered antigens. The double deletion mutant of the invention was expected to completely eliminate enzymatic activity of LT. 

 In describing the mutant LTs of the present invention, LTS63Y is employed to mean mutated LT in which serine residue at position 63 is substituted with tyrosine; and, "LT /110/112" is employed to mean mutated LT in which glutamic acid residues at positions 110 and 112 of LT are deleted, respectively. pBlueKS-/LTS63Y and pBlueKS-/LT 110/112 , were transformed into E. coli Top 10F' . Each of the transformants thus prepared was designated as  Λ  Escherichia coli Top 10F' -pBlueKS-/LTS63Y' and ^Escherichia coli Top 10F' -pBlueKS-/LTz110/112' and deposited with the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) located at KRIBB #52, Oun-dong, Yusong-gu, Taejon 305-333, Republic of Korea, an international depository authority as accession Nos . KCTC 0648BP and KCTC 0649BP, respectively. 
 E. coli Top 10F' transformed with either pBlueKS- /LTS63Y or pBlueKS-/LT ) 110/112 was grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ l of ampicillin and the mutant LTs were purified from the cultures using immobilized D-galactose column and FPLC Superdex 200 column. 
 Since the mobilities of mutant LTs were identical to those of the wild-type LT on SDS-PAGE analysis, the molecular weight of the mutant LT subunits were presumed to be identical to those of wild-type LT. These results suggest that mutant LTs consisting of A and B subunits retain the AB 5  conformation similar to wild-type LT. 
 The ability of mutant LTs to induce morphological changes in cultured Chinese hamster ovary-Kl (CHO-Kl) cells (ATCC, USA) was tested. The morphological changes in the CHO-Kl cells were used to detect the toxic activity of mutant LTs (see: Grant, C.C.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 62:4270-4278(1994)). As little as lOOng/ml of LT induced longitudinal growth of approximately 90% of the CHO-Kl cells, a response previously shown to be dependent upon adenylate cyclase-induced increases in cAMP (.≥e_e.: Guerrant, R.L. et al., Infect. Immun., 10:320-327(1974)). However, the cells treated with each of the mutant LT at the level 

of lOμg/ml showed no morphological changes of the CHO-Kl cells . 
 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was determined as the ability to catalyze the transfer of labeled ADP-ribose from [adenylate- 32 P]NAD to the 41kDa G protein in CHO-Kl membrane (.s_e_e_: Locht, C. et al., Infect. Immun., 55:2546- 2553(1987)). In general, Al subunit of LT is known to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of the membrane-bound substrate G proteins. When membrane proteins from CHO-Kl cells were incubated with wild-type LT in the presence of [adenylate-  32 P]NAD, it specifically ADP-ribosylated the Mr 41,000 proteins, which correspond to the α subunits of the GTP binding Gs protein. In contrast, no ADP-ribosylation of this protein was detected in reaction mixtures incubated with the same amounts of LTS63Y or LT^110/112. This result was identical to that of the negative control treated without toxins. Therefore, the substitution of Tyr 63  for Ser 63  or deletion of Glu 110  and Glu 112  in Al subunit appeared to cause changes in structural integrity of NAD binding crevice that may be important for enzymatic activity of LT. 
 In addition, the levels of cAMP were determined in CHO cells treated with CT, LT, or mutant LTs. The addition of CT or LT caused about 10-fold higher levels of cAMP production than that of untreated cultures. On the other hand, changes in cAMP levels in LTS63Y- or LTΔ110/112- treated cells were barely detectable. These data showed that the presence of A subunit of wild-type LT (accurately LTA1 subunit) is necessary for an increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration and the mutant derivatives, LTS63Y and LTΔ110/112, devoid of enzymatic activity, are unable to form cAMP. 
 The enterotoxicity experiments of mutant LTs examined using a mouse ileal loop test strongly indicate that the mutant LTs possess negligible enterotoxicity in vivo . 
 In the immunogenic ability of mutant LTs, the mice immunized with LTS63Y or LT /110/112 contained high and 

comparable levels of anti-LT antibodies in sera and fecal extracts compared with those immunized with wild-type LT. Moreover, both of the intragastric and intranasal immunizations using mutant LTs could be an effective method for inducing antibody responses of vaccination. 
 The ability of mutant LTs to act as a mucosal adjuvant was assessed by intragastric immunization in mice. 
 LT 110/112 was effective as a mucosal adjuvant on intragastric immunization by inducing high levels of mucosal and systemic antibody responses to the coadministered antigens such as H. pylori whole cell lysate or urease. The ability of mutant LTs to function as a mucosal adjuvant was also assessed by intranasal immunization in mice. Intranasal administration of LTS63Y demonstrated the sensitiveness in inducing mucosal immunigenecity and adjuvanticity. Mice immunized intranasally by coadministration of urease antigen and LTS63Y showed strong mucosal and systemic anti-urease responses including urease-specific secretary IgA, serum IgG and IgA antibodies. 
 The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention. 
 Example 1 : Expression and Purification of mutant LTs 
 Example 1-1 : Plasmid construction and mutagenesis 
 A 1.5Kb BamHI DNA fragment including LT gene from enterotoxigenic E. coli K88ac strain of porcine origin was cloned into pBluescript KS(-) vector (Stratagene, USA). The resulting vector, designated as pBlueKS-/rLT, was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on single- stranded DNA prepared from E. coli CJ236 transformed with pBlueKSVrLT according to the method of MutanK kit (Takara 

Biomedicals, Japan) . The sequence of oligonucleotides used for the substitution and deletion of amino acids were 5'- ATATGATGACGGATATGTTTCCACTTACCTTAGTTTGAGAAGTGCTCACTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO:l) and 5' -AGGCGTATACAGCCCTCACCCATATCAGGTTTCTGCGTTAGG TGGAATACCAT-3' (SEQ ID NO:2), respectively. As a result, serine residue at position 63 was substituted with tyrosine and glutamic acid residues at positions 110 and 112 were deleted, respectively. 
 These residues are in proposed ADP-ribosyltransferase active center of LT and their substitutions or deletions have been shown to inactivate ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and enterotoxicity (see : Domenighini, M. et al., 
 Mol. Microbiol., 14:41-50(1994)). 
 Amino acids at positions 58 to 72 are shown to be folded in a β-strand followed by α-helix, which form the NAD-binding site and amino acids Arg 7 , His 44 , Ser 61  Glu 110  and Glu 112  have been shown to be important for enzymatic activity. Up to date, the modified residues of the LTA subunit are Arg 7  (to Lys), Ser 63  (to Lys), Glu 110  (to Asp), Glu 112  (to Asp or Lys) or Ala 72  (to Arg) (≤≤e_: Lobet, Y. et al., Infect. Immun., 59:2870-2879(1991); Fontana, M.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 63:2356-2360(1995); Di Tommaso, A. et al., infect. Immun., 64:974-979(1996); Douce, G. et al., Infect. Immun., 63:2821-2828(1997); Marchetti, M.M. et al., Vaccine, 16:33-37(1998); Tsuji, T. et al., FEBS Letters, 292:319- 321(1991); Lycke, N. et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 22:2277- 2281(1992); Verweij, W.R. et al., Vaccine, 16:2069- 2076(1998); Giuliani, M.M. et al., J. Exp. Med., 187:1123- 1132(1998) ) . The substitution of Ser 63 , the essential amino acid for NAD-binding and catalytic activity of LT, with Tyr residue having a bulky side chain of phenolic ring was expected to efficiently block NAD-binding in slightly modified LT structure. Deletion of GlullO and Glull2, which are located at the putative ADP-ribosyltransferase active center was also expected to completely eliminate enzymatic activity of LT. 

 The changes of DNA sequences were confirmed using Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Life Science, USA) and each of mutants thus prepared was designated as 
 'pBlueKS-ZLTSδSY' and  λ pBlueKS-/LT 110/112' , respectively. 
 Example 1-2: Expression and purification of the recombinant mutant LTs 
 pBluescript KS(-) vectors containing the mutant LT gene which comprises the 160bp 5'-noncoding region, 1.2kb coding region and 197bp 3'-noncoding region, pBlueKS- /LTS63Y and pBlueKS-/LTz110/112, were transformed into E. coli Top 10F' (Invitrogen, USA) . Each of the transformants thus prepared was designated as ^Escherichia coli Top 10F' - pBlueKS-/LTS63Y' and ^Escherichia coli Top 10F' -pBlueKS-/LT . llO/112' and deposited with the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) located at KRIBB #52, Oun-dong, Yusong- gu, Taejon 305-333, Republic of Korea, an international depository authority as accession Nos. KCTC 0648BP and KCTC 0649BP, respectively. 
 E. coli Top 10F' transformed with either LTS63Y or LT Δ 110/112 was grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and the mutant LTs were purified from the cultures. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in TEAN buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2M NaCl, ImM EDTA and 3mM NaN 3 ) , and lysed with a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corporation, USA). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then filtered using 0.45μm membrane (Micro Filtration Systems, Japan) prior to chromatography on an immobilized D-galactose column (Pierce, USA) (see: Uesaka, Y. et al . , Microb. Pathog. 16:71- 76(1974)). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.3M galactose in TEAN buffer. Holotoxin (AB 5 ) was separated from the free B-subunit pentamer by size exclusion chromatography using FPLC Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia, Sweden). 
 The homogeneity of LTS63Y and LT.4110/112 was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see: 

Figure 1) . In Figure 1, lanes 1 and 2 represent wild-type LTs; lanes 3 and 4, LTS63Ys; and, lanes 5 and 6, LT.4 110/112s, respectively, and the arrow 1 is a position of LT holotoxins and LTB subunit pentamers; arrow 2, LTA subunit; and, arrow 3, LTB subunit monomer. Each lane received lOμg of the proteins and samples in lanes 2, 4 and 6 were heated to 95 ° C for 5min in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, while samples in lanes 1, 3 and 5 were loaded without denaturation by heating and adding β-mercaptoethanol. When the purified mutant LTs were analyzed without denaturation, two protein bands appeared: one band with the size of 70- lOOkDa corresponding to the holotoxin and LTB pentamers; and, the other band with the size of about 30kDa corresponding to the LTA subunit. When the purified mutant LTs were boiled for 5min with β-mercaptoethanol, the holotoxins were dissociated into two bands of about 30 and llkDa, corresponding to the A and B subunits of LT, respectively. Since the mobilities of mutant LTs were identical to those of the wild-type LT, the molecular weight of the mutant LT subunits were presumed to be identical to those of wild-type LT. 
 These results suggest that the innate structure of the A subunit associated with pentameric B subunits of LT is not affected by substitution of tyrosine for Ser 63  or deletion of Glu 110  and Glu 112  residues on NAD-binding pocket. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the binding ability of the B subunit of mutant LTs to G M1  ganglinoside was similar to that of the normal B subunit using a G M1 -ELISA, and mutant LTs were reacted with anti-LT antibody in Western blot analysis. These results imply that mutant LTs retain the AB 5  conformation similar to wild-type LT . 
 Example 2: Enzymatic and Biologic Characterization of mutant LTs 
 Example 2-1 : Cell elongation assay 

 The ability of mutant LTs to induce morphological changes in cultured Chinese hamster ovary-Kl (CHO-Kl) cells (ATCC, USA) was tested as described previously (see: Guerrant, R.L. et al., Infect. Immun., 10:320-327(1974); Grant, C.C.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 62:4270-4278(1994)). CHO-Kl cells were incubated for 24hr as monolayer cultures in minimal essential medium alpha (MEM-α) (Gibco-BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in humidified and 5% C0 2  atmosphere at 37T. The cells were washed once with Hanks' s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma, USA) and then incubated with 0.1% trypsin for 5min. After centrifugation, they were washed once, and then resuspended in the growth medium. To each well of a 48-well tissue culture plate, the same numbers of CHO-Kl cells (10 4  in 200μl volume per well) were allowed to adhere for 4hr prior to the addition of the toxin dilutions and then incubated in humidified and 5% C0 2  atmosphere at 37 J for 24hr. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with methanol, and stained with 0.04% Trypan Blue Solution (Gibco-BRL, USA). After staining, the cells were washed, air dried, and analyzed for morphological changes by light microscopy. 
 The morphological changes in the CHO-Kl cells were used to detect the toxic activity of mutant LTs (see: Grant, C.C.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 62:4270-4278(1994)). As little as lOOng/ml of wild-type LT induced longitudinal growth of approximately 90% of the CHO-Kl cells, a response previously shown to be dependent upon adenylate cyclase- induced increases in cAMP (see: Guerrant, R.L. et al., Infect. Immun., 10:320-327(1974)). However, the cells treated with mutant LTs at the level of lOμg/ml showed no morphological changes of the CHO-Kl cells (see: Figure 2 and Table 1) . In Figure 2, A shows toxin-untreated CHO-Kl cells; B, CHO-Kl cells treated with lOOng/ml of wild-type LT; C, CHO-Kl cells treated with lOμg/ml of LTS63Y; and, D, CHO-Kl cells treated with lOμg/ml of LT.^110/112, respectively.

 Example 2-2: ADP-ribosyltransferase activity test 
 For the preparation of crude membranes, CHO-Kl cells were maintained in monolayer culture by serial passage in MEM-α medium supplement with 10% FBS (see : Locht C. et al., Infect. Immun., 55:2546-2553(1987)) . The cells were detached from the flask, washed once in PBS (pH 7.2) and then lysed in a homogenizer (Weaton, USA) . The supernatant from these lysates was collected following centrif ugation at l,000xg for 20 min and further centrifuged at 18,000xg for 7 min to obtain microsomal or membrane pellets. The washed membrane pellet was resuspended in 50mM Tris- HCl(pH8.0) at a concentration of lmg of protein per ml and stored at -70°C until use. 
 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was determined as the ability to catalyze the transfer of labeled ADP-ribose from [adenylate- 32 P]NAD to the 41kDa G protein in CHO-Kl membrane (see : Locht, C. et al., Infect. Immun., 55:2546- 2553(1987)) . Reaction mixtures (lOOμl) containing 32μM [adenylate- 32 P]NAD(2μCi) (NEN, USA), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 

containing lOmM thymidine, lOOmM ATP, 20mM DTT, lOOμM GTP, 50μg of CHO-Kl membrane proteins, and lOμg of wild-type or mutant LTs were incubated at 37  ° C for 30min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1ml of ice-cold 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the membranes were sedimented by centrifugation (15, OOOxg, 7min) at 4 °C . The membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and sedimented once more by centrifugation before being solubilized in 50μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (67mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.03% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were heated to 95  ° C for 5min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography . 
 In general, the Al subunit of LT is capable of binding NAD and catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of membrane-bound Gs, a GTP-binding regulatory protein associated with adenylate cyclase (see: Spangler, B.D., Microbiol. Rev., 56:622-647(1992)). The consequence is a sharp increase in cAMP production resulting in excessive accumulation of salts and water in the intestinal lumen (s_e_e_: Field, M. et al., N. Engl . J. Med., 322:800- 806(1989)). The A subunit of LT is known to catalyze ADP- ribosylation of the membrane-bound substrate G proteins. 
 Figure 3 shows ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of LT, LTS63Y and LT«d 110/112 analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% gel followed by autoradiography. In Figure 3, lane 1 represents a reaction mixture incubated without toxins; lane 2, with lOμg of wild-type LT; lane 3, with lOμg of LTS63Y; and, lane 4, with lOμg of LT. llO/112, respectively, and the arrow denotes the position of the Mr-41,000 band corresponding to the Gs protein. 
 As shown in Figure 3, when 50μg of membrane proteins from CHO-Kl cells were incubated with wild-type LT in the presence of [adenylate- 32 P] NAD, it specifically ADP- ribosylated the Mr-41,000 proteins, which correspond to the α subunits of the GTP binding Gs proteins. In contrast, no ADP-ribosylation of this protein was detected in reaction 

mixtures incubated with the same amounts of LTS63Y or LT- 110/112. This result was identical to that of the negative control treated without toxins in lane 1. Therefore, the substitution of Tyr 63  for Ser 63  or deletion of Glu 110  and Glu 112  in A subunit did cause changes in structural integrity of NAD binding crevice that may be important for enzymatic activity of LT. 
 Example 2-3: Measurement of intracellular cAMP accumulation 
 CHO cells (ATCC, USA) were maintained in MEM-α medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a 24-well plate at a concentration of 5xl0 4  cells per well, grown to near confluency, and incubated in MEM-α containing FBS and ImM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX) for 30min prior to addition of toxins (see: Grant, C.C.R. et al., Infect. Immun., 62:4270-4278(1994)). Either cholera toxin(CT), cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) , trypsin-activated wild-type 
 LT, LTS63Y, or LT.4110/112 was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 18h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and intracellular cAMP was extracted by adding 200μl of 50mM HC1 to each well and placing the plates in -70°C deep freezer for 20min. cAMP was measured with a Biotrak cAMP enzyme immuno-assay (EIA) system (Amersham Life Science, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
 As a result, the levels of cAMP were determined in CHO cells treated with CT, CTB, LT, LTS63Y, or LT l 110/112 (see: Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4, the addition of CT or LT to reach a concentration of 50ng/ml caused about 10-fold higher levels of cAMP production than those of untreated cultures. On the other hand, cAMP formation in cultures treated with CTB, LTS63Y or  ~  T A 110/112 was undetectable even at a concentration as high as 5μg/ml. In Figure 4,  Λ S' and  λ D' denote LTS63Y and LT lllO/112, respectively, and the gray bars represent treatments of 500ng of CT or LT and 5μg of CTB, S or D; and, black bars, 

50ng of CT or LT and 500ng of CTB, S or D. Results are shown as mean titers and error bars indicate standard deviations from the mean. 
 These data showed that the presence of wild-type LTA subunit (accurately LTAl subunit) is necessary for an increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration and the mutant derivatives, LTS63Y and LT llO/112, devoid of enzymatic activity, are unable to form cAMP. 
 Example 2-4: Assessment of toxicity using mouse ileal loops 
 The enterotoxicity of mutant LTs was examined using a mouse ileal loops test (see: Yamamoto, S. et al., J. Exp. Med., 185:1203-1210(1997)). Groups of mice were anesthetized, and different doses of each toxin were injected into ileal loops (LT, lOOng or lμg per mouse; and, mLT, lOμg or lOOμg per mouse) of individual mice. The mice were sacrificed 18hr after the injection, and the fluid content of the ileal loops was determined; values of more than 40μl/cm were considered positive (indicative of toxicity) . 
 One hundred nanogram of wild-type LT induced significant fluid accumulation in small intestine, while no fluid accumulation was observed in the loop treated with thousand-fold higher levels (lOOμg) of mutant LTs (see: Table 1) . These data strongly indicate that the mutant LTs possess negligible enterotoxicity in vivo. 
 Example : Immunological Characterization 
 Example 3-1 : Mucosal immunogenicities of mLTs 
 Six-week-old female Balb/c mice were purchased from Charles River (Japan) . The mucosal immunogenicities of LTS63Y and LT.4110/112 were tested via two immunization routes. Groups of mice were immunized intragastrically with 25μg of LTS63Y or LT.dllO/112 four times on days 0, 7, 

14 and 21 or intranasally with 2μg of LTS63Y or LT J110/112 on days 0, 7 and 14 (see: Takahashi, I. et al., J Infect. Dis., 173:627-635(1996)). The control groups received PBS alone. The serum and fecal antibody titers to LT were determined using samples prepared on day 7 following the last immunization (see: Figure 5). Figure 5 shows anti-LT secretary IgA, serum IgG and IgA antibody responses on intragastric (white bar) or intranasal (black bar) immunization, where 1 represents PBS treatment; 2, wild- type LT treatment; 3, LTS63Y treatment; 4, LT^ 110/112 treatment. 
 As shown in Figure 5, the mice immunized with LTS63Y or LT- 110/112 contained high and comparable levels of anti-LT antibodies in sera and fecal extracts compared with those immunized with wild-type LT. The LTS63Y was slightly more immunogenic than LT Δ 110/112 on both intragastric and intranasal administration. On the other hand, titers of anti-LT in the serum or fecal extracts of mice intranasally immunized with wild-type or mutant LTs were slightly higher than those observed in mice intragastrically administered. Intranasal immunization offers several advantages compared with other immunization route: lower doses of proteins are required to induce antibody responses, which means lower cost for vaccine production ( see : Yamamoto, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 94:5267-5272(1997)). When administered intranasally, only 6% of the quantity of mutant LT used in intragastric immunization was required to elicit slightly higher levels of secretary IgA responses and this dose also effectively induced systemic IgG and IgA antibody responses. Thus, intranasal immunization using mutant LT could be an effective method for vaccination in humans and animals. 
 Example 3-2: Mucosal adjuvanticity of mutant LTs 
 To test a mucosal adjuvanticity, mice were immunized either intragastrically by 125μg of H. pylori urease 

together with 25μg of LTS63Y or LT.dllO/112 on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 or intranasally by 20μg of the same antigen together with 2μg of LTS63Y or LT.4110/112 as an adjuvant on days 0, 7 and 14. Fecal extracts and serum samples were collected on day 7 following the last immunization and the appearance of either mucosal or systemic antibody responses was monitored using ELISA. 
 LT- and urease-specific antibodies were measured with a G M1  capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (G M1 -ELISA) and direct ELISA, respectively, as described previously (see : Spiegel, S. J. Cell. Biochem. , 42:143- 152(1990); Douce, G. et al., Infect. Immun., 65:2821- 2828(1997)). Plates were coated with 150ng of G M1  (Sigma, USA) per well of a 96-well EIA/RIA plate (Costar, USA) for a G M1 -capture ELISA, and then incubated at 37  ° C for lhr. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20("PBST") and blocked with 2.5% skim milk(Difco, USA) in PBST at 37 °C for lhr. After washing with PBST three times, lOOng of wild-type LT was added into wells and plates were incubated for lhr at 37  ° C and washed three times with PBST. In case of a direct ELISA, plates were coated with lμg of urease per well incubated for lhr at 37°C with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti- mouse antibodies specific for mouse immunoglobulinG (IgG) (1:5000), IgA (1:2000) (KPL, USA) or IgGl, IgG2a or IgG2b (1:2000) (Biosource, USA). After washing six times with PBST, bound antibody was visualized by addition of 3, 3' 5 1 5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) . The absorbance at 450 nm was determined and ELISA titers were recorded as the highest dilution of serum which gave an absorbance value above the level measeured in preimmune samples. 
 Mucosal adjuvanticity of LTS63Y and LT. llQ/112 by intragastric immunization 
 The ability of mutant LTs to act as a mucosal adjuvant was assessed by intragastric immunization in 

mice (see: Figure 6: 1, PBS treatment; 2, 125μg urease treatment; 3, 125μg urease and 25μg LT treatment; 4, 125μg urease and 25μg LTS63Y treatment; 5, 125μg urease and 25μg LT lllO/112 treatment). As shown in Figure 6, mice immunized intragastrically with H. pyroli urease alone showed no significant levels of antibodies to the antigen. Mice immunized by coadministration of urease and LT-d 110/112 produced high levels of urease antibody responses comparable to those immunized with wild-type LT, while mice immunized by coadministration of the antigen and LTS63Y showed no significant sero-conversion. Altering the dose of LT- 110/112 to 10 or 125μg did not cause any change in the immune response to urease. LTS63Y did not show any significant adjuvanticity to the urease, even when 125μg was coadministered with the urease. 
 To test the adjuvanticity of LT- 110/112 with other antigens, whole cell lysate of H. pylori was used as an antigen and it was observed that LT.dllO/112 also induced antibody responses to whole cell lysate. These data suggest that Ll Δ 110/112 effectively functions as a mucosal adjuvant on intragastric immunization by inducing strong mucosal and systemic antibody responses to coadministered antigens such as H. pylori whole cell lysate or urease. To further assess the immunologic response induced by LT_ 110/112 following intragastric immunization, IgG subclass responses were determined by ELISA (see: Figure 8A: 1, PBS treatment; 2, 125μg urease treatment; 3, 125μg urease and 25μg LT treatment; 4, 125μg urease and 25μg LTS63Y treatment; 5, 125μg urease and 25μg LT l 110/112 treatment) . 
 As shown in Figure 8A, urease antibody responses enhanced by LT Δ 110/112 were largely restricted to IgGl(gray bars), rather than IgG2a (white bars) or IgG2b (black bars) subclass antibody in sera, and similar antibody patterns were observed using wild-type LT as an adjuvant . 

 Generally, CT elicits adjuvant responses by inducing antigen-specific CD4+ T cells secreting interleukin (IL-4), IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 that correlated directly with serum IgGl and IgG2b subclass responses in mice orally immunized with protein Ag and CT as adjuvant (s_e_e_: Marinaro. M. et al., J. Immunol., 155:4621-4629(1995). It was reported that mutant CT(S61F), despite lack of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity with resultant cAMP induction, elicits serum IgGl and IgG2b subclass Ab responses when administrated intranasally (see: Yamamoto, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 94:5267-5272(1997) or subcutaneously (^≥e.: Yamamoto, S. et al., J. Exp. Med., 185:1203-1210(1997). On the other hand, oral immunization with LT promotes IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b, which are supported by a mixed CD4+ Thl- and Th2-type responses associated with IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 production (see : Takahashi, I. et al., J. Infect. Dis., 173:627-635(1996). In the results of present invention, intragastric administration of LT,4110/112 or wild-type LT as an adjuvant induced predominant IgGl Ab responses as shown in Figure 8A. This result is not consistent with the typical IgG subclass responses induced by wild-type LT and rather resembles the responses induced by CT activating CD4+ Th2-type cells (s_e_e_: Marinaro, M. et al., J. Immunol., 155:4621-4629(1995). In contrast, LTS63Y induced IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b antibody responses to H. pylori urease on intranasal immunization. The similar result is also observed by wild-type LT eliciting IgGl, IgG2a and IgG2b subclass responses, which are supported by a mixed CD4+ Thl- and Th2-type response (s_≤e_: Takahashi, I. et al., J. Infect. Dis., 173:627-635(1996)). Therefore, the mutant LTs of this invention, LTS63Y and LT Δ 110/112, induced distinct IgG subclass responses, depending on immunization routes. 
 Mucosal adjuvanticity of LTS63Y and LT J 110/112 by intranasal immunization 

 The ability of mutant LTs to function as a mucosal adjuvant was also assessed by intranasal immunization in mice. Intranasal administration of wild-type or mutant LTs demonstrated the sensitiveness in inducing mucosal immunigenecity and adjuvanticity (.≥e_e_: Figure 7: 1, PBS treatment; 2, 20μg urease treatment; 3, 20μg urease and 2μg wild-type LT treatment; 4, 20μg urease and 2μg LTS63Y treatment; 5, 20μg urease and 2μg LT_d 110/112 treatment) . 
 Mice immunized intranasally by coadministration of urease antigen and LTS63Y showed high levels of mucosal and systemic anti-urease responses including urease-specific secretary IgA, serum IgG and IgA antibodies, which were equivalent to the responses observed when wild-type LT was used as an adjuvant. However, mice immunized by coadministration of urease and LT_ 110/112 showed lower level of antibodies to urease, similar to those levels induced by urease alone. When 0.2μg of LTS63Y was used, antibody responses to urease in both fecal extracts and sera were lower by a factor of approximately 10, but when 6μg of LTS63Y was used, no increase in antibody responses to urease was induced. 
 In addition, as shown in Figure 8B, LTS63Y induced IgGl (gray bars), IgG2a (black bars) and IgG2b (white bars) subclass antibody responses to H. pylori urease, and these results were quite different from those IgG subclass responses (predominant IgGl) resulted from the intragastric immunization with the mutant LT Δ 110/112 (,≥e_e_: Figure 8B: 1, PBS treatment; 2, 20μg urease treatment; 3, 20μg urease and 2μg LT treatment; 4, 20μg urease and 2μg LTS63Y treatment; 5, 20μg urease and 2μg LT.dllO/112 treatment) . Therefore, the mutant LTs of this invention, LTS63Y and T Δ 110/112 induced district IgG subclass responses, depending on immunization routes. 
 As described above, the mutant LTs of this invention have shown different abilities to act as mucosal adjuvant according to the route of administration. This suggests that different mutant forms of LT may require different 

immunization routes for adequate adjuvanticity, and that specific immunization route may elicit specific mechanisms of up-regulation of immune responses, independent of cAMP levels. Thus, selection of the route of immunization may be critical for determining the mucosal adjuvant activity of mutant LTs. Mucosal vaccines delivered into the nasal tract provide several advantages. For example, lower doses of antigen and adjuvant are required to induce effective antibody responses when compared to intragastric immunization, which can decrease the cost of vaccination. 
 As clearly illustrated and demonstrated as above, the present invention provides detoxified and immunologically active proteins (mutant LTs). The mutant LTs was expressed from recombinant expression vectors, pBlueKS-/LTS63Y and pBlueKS-/LT 110/112 that contain mutated DNA sequences encoding amino acids in the ADP-ribosyltransferase active center. In contrast to wild-type LT, both of the LTS63Y and LT l 110/112 did not induce any toxic activities. Both of the mutants elicited high and comparable levels of anti- LT antibodies when delivered either intragastrically or intranasally, inducing systemic and local responses in serum and fecal extracts. Thus, they might be useful for the development of a novel diarrheal vaccine in human and animals. In addition, the antibody production ability using LTS63Y and LT,4110/112 as adjuvants against H. pylori urease may be effective for prevention and treatment of various diseases. The adjuvant activity of these mutants might be very useful to develop an effective mucosal vaccine component.
