 Description of the Prior Art Tumor invasion and metastasis are defined as the proliferating stages of the tumor cells at whole body from the primary tumor, which finally persuade patient into death. Cancer cells detached from the primary malignant neoplasm(mostly endothelium) penetrate the basement membrane which separates the cancer cells from the other tissue. As some penetrated cells can invade not only endothelium but also basement membrane which surrounds the blood vessels, they can migrate freely via blood vessels and finally set down on capillary vessels. If cancer cells penetrate capillary vessels again, they can form secondary tumor. The probability of secondary tumor formation from the primary tumor followed by dissemination and invasion is under one in ten thousand(see: Erkki Scientific American, 257:72-77(1996)). 
 The interaction of cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) is required for the tumor invasion and metastasis. 
 WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 2 During metastasis, tumor cells induce endothelial cell death, leading to exposure of basement membrane, which facilitates adhesion of tumor cells with ECM protein in surrounding stroma(see: Hynes, R. Cell, 48:549(1987)). 
 These substrate proteins promote cell adhesion by binding with cell surface receptor including integrin family. 
 In terms of structure, each integrin is a heterodimer formed by a subunit and P subunit via noncovalent binding. It has been reported that pi subfamily plays a role in cell-cell interaction directly as well as in cell-ECM substrate adhesion as a major contact mediator(see: Larjava, H. et al., J. Cell. Biol., 110:803- 815(1990)). p2 subfamily distributed in leukocyte includes cell surface receptors which mediate cell-cell interaction. 
 p3 subfamily including vitronectin receptor and thrombocyte glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex may be able to function in the development of tumor invasiveness and in the progress of tumor into the malignant tumor(see: Albelda, S. M. et al., Cancer Res., 50:6757-6764(1990)). 
 The integrin receptor complex that spans transversely cell membrane plays a role in connecting cytoskeletal network with extracellular matrix. The core sequences, common to cell-adhesion molecules like fibrinogen, vitronectin and laminin are known to be responsible for cell adhesion, spread and integration. By the way, it is also suggested that cancer promotion and metastasis can be closely related to the role of integrin(see: Giancotti, F. 
 G. and Rouslahti, Cell, 60:849-859(1990); Hynes, R. O., Cell, 69:11-25(1992); Nip, J. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 96:2096-2103(1995)). Over-expression of fibronectin receptor a501 is known to diminish a mutated phenotype in CHO(Chinese hamster ovary) and decrease in the expression level of integrin a5pl in the rodents cells which are mutated into ras(see: Plantefaben, L. C. and Hynes, R. O., Cell, 56:281-290(1989)). Super-fibronectin, a fibronectin polymer, has been reported to prevent cancer promotion and metastasis(see: Pasqualini, R. et al., Nature Medicine, I l 1 T r 3 2:1197-1203(1996)). 
 Integrin aVp3 can be useful as a marker of most malignant tumor cells, which shows the function of integrin in the development of malignant human melanoma(see: Albelda, S. M. et al., Cancer Res., 50:6757- 6764(1990)). The expression and adhesive phenotype of integrin aV gene have a direct correlation with in vivo proliferation of human melanoma(see: Felding-Habermann, J. 
 Clin. Invest., 89:2018-2022(1992)). 
 Meanwhile, angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessels formation by sprouting of new vessels from existing blood vessels(see: Folkman, J. and D'Amore, P. 
 Cell, 87:1153-1155(1996)). Angiogenesis occurs during development, wound healing and inflammation, and is the essential process in the tumor growth. Cell-adhesion molecules regulate angiogenesis in smooth muscle cells and capillary endothelial cells(see: Nguyen, M. et al., Nature, 365:267 (1993)). 
 The turnover of tumor angiogenesis is determined by the balance change between stimulating and inhibiting regulators. In relation to this, two cytokine-dependent pathways of angiogenesis have existed and are distinguished by the distinct vascular cell integrins, .aVp3 and aVP5. These two integrins are expressed in newly formed blood vessels and play an important role in angiogenesis stimulated by bFGF(basic fibroblast growth factor), TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor-a), VEGF(vascular endothelial growth factor) and fragments of human tumors(see: Friedlander, M. et al., Science, 270:1500- 1502(1995)). The activation of aVp3 integrin stimulates a survival signal inducing the vessel proliferation and differentiation, which demonstrates that the signal transmission by cytokine and integrin receptor is related to angiogenesis(see: Brooks, P. C. et al., Cell, 79:1157- 1164(1994)). 
 Disintegrins, which are known to be potent antagonists of integrin, are small proteins derived from the snake venom(see: Niewiarowski, S. et al., Semin. 
 H:\Simeona\Keep\Speci\61848.00.doc 14/11/03 WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 4 Hematol., 31:289-300(1994)). Most of disintegrins contain Arg-Gly-Asp(GRD) or Lys-Gly-Asp(KGD) motifs recognized by thrombocyte fibrinogen receptor, a2bp3. It is reported that disintegrins containing RGD sequences inhibit adhesion of integrin-mediated metastatic cells with ECM and finally block metastasis(see: Trikha, M. et al., Cancer Res., 54 (8):4993-4998(1994)). Integrin aVp3 has been identified as a marker of angiogenic vessel in chicken embryo and human cells(see: Brooks, P. C. et al., Science, 264:569-571 (1994)). Monoclonal antibody of integrin aVp3 disrupts angiogenesis by inducing apoptosis of the newly formed vascular endothelial cells. Synthesized peptides containing RGD sequence, which is known to prevent integrin aVp3 from binding with ligands, inhibit a tumor-induced angiogenesis (see: Brooks, P. C. et al., Cell, 79:1157- 1164(1994)) of CAM(chick chorioallantoic membrane). 
 Furthermore, Angiogenin, which is known to help adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cell as a subsidiary factor, is also inhibited by synthesized RGD peptides. 
 Recently, the snake venom-derived disintegrin, Triflavin is reported to inhibit TNF-a stimulated angiogenesis. These results provide the possibility that disintegrins, synthesized RGD peptides and anti-aVp3 monoclonal antibodies, may be developed as anti-cancer drugs. 
 On the other hand, the snake venom is known to contain various kinds of proteins that affect thrombosis and hemostasis. Since thrombus formation resulted from the abnormal platelet coagulation raises lethal thrombosis, platelet aggregation antagonist or agonist was isolated from the snake venom and identified. As for aggregation mechanism, platelet aggregation is mediated by fibrinogen binding with a glycoprotein in the platelet of GP IIb/IIIa receptor, where the amino acid sequence of Arg-Gly-Asp(RGD) of fibrinogen binding site has been reported to be crucial for fibrinogen binding with GP IIb/IIIa receptor(see: Rouslagti E. and Pierschbacher M. Science, 238:491- 497(1987)). Therefore, proteins containing the said WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 sequence competitively inhibit fibrinogen binding with GP IIb/IIIa receptor which leads to the suppression of platelet aggregation. At first, inhibitors of GP IIb/IIIa receptor isolated from the snake venom were small proteins of 5 kD to 9 kD(see: Huang, T. F. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262:16157-16163(1987)). Afterwards, various kinds of platelet aggregation inhibitors, which included large molecular weight antagonists, were isolated from the snake venom. These inhibitors are rich in cysteins, and common in binding with GP IIb/IIIa receptor by the interaction with the Arg-Gly-Asp(RGD) amino acid sequence. In addition, the structures of Kistrin(see: Alder, M. et al., Science, 253:445-448(1991); Alder, M. et al., Biochemistry, 32: 282- 289(1993)), Flavoridine(see: Klaus, W. et al., J. Mol. 
 Biol., 232:897-906(1993); Senn, H. and Klaus, J. Mol. 
 Biol., 232:907-925(1993)), Albolabrin(see: Jaseja, M. et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 218: 853-860(1993)) and Echistatin(see: Chen, et al., Biochemistry, 30:11625- 11636(1991); Cooke, R. M. et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 202:323-328(1991); Cooke, R. M. et al., Protein Eng., 5:473-477(1992); Saudek, V. et al., Biochemistry, 30:7369- 7372(1991); Dalvit, C. et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 202:315- 321(1991)) have been identified by nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopy. And, the inhibition of fibrinogen binding with GP IIb/IIIa receptor by these antagonists was ascertained by using animal model(see: Collen, B. J. Clin. Invest., 76:101-108(1985); Gold, H. 
 K. et al., Circulation, 77:670-677(1988); Yasuda, T. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 81:1284-1291(1988); Coller, B. S. 
 et al., Blood, 68:783-786(1986); Hanson, S. R. et al., J. 
 Clin. Invest., 81:149-158(1988)). 
 In relation to this, extensive studies have been made on the venom of Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus or Caliginosus. Salmosin derived from the venom of Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus, a protein of about 7.5 kD, has been proposed as a potent platelet aggregation inhibitor(see: Korean Patent No. 142606). However, little i' 6 is known about the venom of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov because of the rareness of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov compared with other snakes. This invention was made on the assumption that the potent toxicity and high lethality of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov venom may be closely related with the bleeding.

In addition, the inventors found that the recombinant Saxatilin possesses an inhibitory activity against platelet aggregation and angiogenesis which is essential for the metastasis and proliferation of tumor, without any untoward effect on normal endothelial cell proliferation, assuring that the said protein can be developed as an anti-tumor agent.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present inventors isolated Saxatilin from the venom of a Korean snake, Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov and cloned cDNA encoding Saxatilin, a recombinant expression vector comprising the cDNA, and a recombinant microorganism transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and manufactured recombinant Saxatilin by culturing the transformant. 
 The method of isolating Saxatilin from Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov and the process for preparing recombinant Saxatilin are illustrated in more detail as followings. 
 The venom of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov was collected and purified by using gel-filtration column and reverse-phase HPLC, to obtain a protein possessing platelet aggregation inhibitory activity. Determination of amino acid sequence of the protein revealed that it is a novel protein and it was designated as Saxatilin. The inventors cloned cDNA encoding Saxatilin from cDNA. library derived from the venom of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov. The Saxatilin cDNA was designed to contain both Xho I restriction site and protease KEX2 recognition site at Nterminal region and introduced into the EcoR I/Xho I site at C-terminal region of c-factor secretory signal protein of an expression vector, pPIC9(8.0 kb). The expression vector encoding Saxatilin was designated as pPSAX. The expression vector may be transformed into yeast cells of Pichia sp., Hansenula sp. and Saccharomyces sp., preferably Pichia sp. such as Pichia pastoris GS115, SMD 1168 and KM71. 
 The constructed pPSAX was transformed into Pichia WO 02/14488 PCT/KROO/00809 9 pastoris GS115 and the transformed cell was designated as "Pichia pastoris Y/pPSAX(Pichia pastoris Y/pPSAX)", and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms(KCCM, Hongje-l-dong 361-221, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea), an international depository authority on July 21, 2000 as accession No. KCCM-10201. 
 The process for preparing recombinant Saxatilin comprises a step of culturing the transformed microorganism to obtain recombinant Saxatilin: The transformed cells were inoculated in the minimum glycerol media and incubated until 1.0 O.D 600 unit, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in the minimum methanol media and cultured in a fed-batch wise. The minimum glycerol media(pH contained 0.5 to 1.5% of yeast extract or peptone as nitrogen source, 0.5 to of glycerol, dextrose or glucose as carbon source and trace amounts of biotin. The minimum methanol media was the minimum glycerol media with 0.1 to 1.0% preferably 0.3 to 0.8% most preferably 0.5% of methanol as carbon source. During the cell incubation in minimum glycerol media, the temperature condition was 25 to 35 preferably 28 to 32 oC, most preferably 30 oC, for 12 to 24 hr, preferably 16 to 20 hr, most preferably 18 hr. During the cell incubation in the minimum methanol media, the temperature condition was 25 to 35 OC, preferably 28 to 32 most preferably 30 OC, for 72 to 120 hr, preferably 84 to 108 hr, more preferably 96 hr. 
 For the purification of recombinant Saxatilin, the supernatant obtained from the cell broth by the centrifugation was applied to a hydrophobic column and HPLC, where the hydrophobic column was charged with phenyl Sepharose resin, and preferably eluted with 0.5 to 2M ammonium sulfate solution, and HPLC was equipped with source 30 RPC column and preferably eluted with 0.01 to 0.2% TFA in acetonitrile. 
 The platelet aggregation-inhibitory activity of WO 02/14488 PCT/KROO/00809 recombinant Saxatilin was compared with that of a known platelet aggregation inhibitor, recombinant Salmosin. As a result, it was demonstrated that the platelet aggregationinhibitory activity of recombinant Saxatlilin was similar to that of recombinant Salmosin. In addition, in case of being expressed in yeast cell, the expression efficiency of Saxatilin was superior to that of Salmosin. Comparing the amino acid sequence of recombinant Saxatilin with that of Salmosin, it was confirmed that the difference in the 4 9 t h amino acid of two proteins brought about the different expression mode and efficiency in two proteins. Since the recombinant Salmosin contained the 4 8 t h and 4 9 th Arg, it is readily susceptible to a signal peptidase existing in yeast, which recognizes the amino acid sequence of Lys and Arg, while the recombinant Saxatilin with 4 9 t h Met was rarely attacked by the same enzyme. Thus, it was understood that the 49 t h amino acid in recombinant Saxatilin plays an important role in improving expression efficiency and stability. 
 To investigate whether Saxatilin inhibits tumor metastasis, the effect of Saxatilin on angiogenesis was determined by HUVEC(human umbilical vein endothelial cell) assay and CAM(chick chorioallantoic membrane) assay, which were developed as the model system for the study of angiogenisis. As a result, it was demonstrated that Saxatilin inhibited angiogenesis induced by tumor. The inhibition of HUVEC proliferation by Saxatilin was due to the direct interaction of Saxatilin with Vitronectin receptor, aV03 integrin, localized on the surface of HUVEC. 
 It has been already known that disintegrin prevents tumor cells from binding with endothelia, leading to suppress the colony formation of the matastatic tumor. However, little has been known whether the growth of already-invaded metastatic tumor was inhibited. In this regard, the effect of Saxatilin on the metastatic tumor growth was investigated, which revealed that Saxatilin effectively inhibits the metastatic tumor growth without cytotoxicity. 
 WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 11 The present invention is further illustrated in the following Examples, which should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention. 
 Example 1: Purification of Saxatilin To isolate Saxatilin from the venom of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov, 302.4 mg of crude venom from the snake was applied to a Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column(l.8 x 100 cm) equilibrated with PBS buffer, and fractionated at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The activity of Saxatilin was determined by the platelet aggregation inhibition assay: The concentrated human platelet rich plasma(PRP) obtained from 400 ml of human blood was diluted to the concentration of 300,000 platelets/pl. The diluted PRP(450 l) was mixed with 50 il of PBS and then incubated in the aggregometer(Chromo-Log, USA) at 37 OC for 3 minutes. 
 After collagen(2 nM) was added into the PRP solution to induce the platelet aggregation, the difference of light transmittance was measured. 
 The active fractions showing the inhibitory effect on the platelet aggregation contained a protein whose molecular weight ranges from 7 kD to 10 kD in Native-PAGE gel. The pooled active fractions were applied to a reverse-phase HPLC(C18) column(7.8 x 300 mm) equilibrated with distilled water containing TFA, eluted by the linear gradient of 5-45% acetonitrile with 0.1%(v/v) TFA. Saxatilin was eluted at the point of 21% acetonitrile with the purification yield of 0.2%. 
 Example 2: Amino acid sequence analysis of Saxatilin To analyze the amino acid sequence of Saxatilin, the purified Saxatilin was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gel under the reducing condition and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride(PVDF) membrane(Biorad, USA). The WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 12 N-terminal amino acid sequence of Saxitilin was determined to be GEECDCGAPANP(SEQ ID NO:9) by automated protein sequence analyzer. 
 Example 3: Determination of the molecular weight of Saxatilin by mass spectrometer The molecular weight of Saxatilin was determined as three different forms of 7,444, 7,515 and 7,647 Da by the aid of Mass spectrometer(Kratos Kompact Mold II, Kratos Analytical, Manchester, which is ascribed to three types of isoforms containing N-terminal sequences of 'EAGEE' and 'AGEE', in addition to 'GEE'. 
 Example 4: Determination of DNA sequence encoding Saxatilin For the cloning of Saxatilin cDNA, mRNA was extracted from the venom gland of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov using oligo-dT cellulose. cDNA library was constructed by using a template of mRNA obtained from the venom gland, and oligo-dT primer and reverse transcriptase. Then, 5' primer was designed by deduction from the N-terminal sequence, which is 5'-GGNGARGARTGYGAYTGYGG-3'(SEQ ID NO:3): primer 1. 
 The 3' primer was designed by deduction from the C-terminal sequence, determined during subcloning process, which is 5'-GGCATGGAAGGGATTTCTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO:4): primer 2. The polymerase chain reaction(PCR) was performed using the primer, the 3' primer and a template of the synthesized cDNA library of venom gland. The PCR products of 220 bp separated on agarose gel electrophoresis were subcloned into pGEM-T vector(Promega, USA) and used to analyze the DNA sequence encoding Saxatilin(SEQ ID NO:2). The total amino acid sequence of Saxatilin was deduced from the cloned cDNA sequence(SEQ ID NO:1). 
 Example 5: Comparison of the inhibitory effect of Saxatilin with known peptides possessing WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 13 platelet aggregation inhibitory activity For the comparison of the inhibitory effect of Saxatilin with those of other known peptides possessing platelet aggregation inhibitory activity, Salmosin(see: Korean Patent No. 142606, SEQ ID NO:10) and GRGDSP(SEQ ID NO:7), the platelet aggregation inhibition assay was performed as follows: 225 il of the human platelet rich plasma(300,000 platelets/L) was mixed with 25 [il of the platelet aggregation inhibitor peptide solutions in PBS and then incubated in aggregometer(Chromo-Log, USA) at 25 °C for 5 minutes. After ADP was added into each of the PRP solutions to induce the platelet aggregation, the turbidity was measured, respectively(see: Figure In Figure 1, represents the degree of platelet aggregation inhibition of Saxatilin; Salmosin(SEQ ID NO:10); and GRGDSP(SEQ ID NO: respectively. As shown in Figure 1, IC 50 value of Saxatilin was 179 nM, which is comparable with 173 nM of Salmosin, and 1000 times more potent inhibitory effect than GRGDSP peptide. 
 Example 6: Cloning of Saxatilin DNA The PCR(Robocycler, Stratagene, USA) was performed using a plasmid containing Saxatilin cDNA, prepared from Example 4, as a template and the following two primers: N-terminal primer, containing both Xho I restriction site and protease KEX2 recognition site, 5'-CCGCTCGAGAAAAGAGAGGCCGGAGAAGAATGT-3'(SEQ ID C-terminal primer, containing both EcoR I restriction site and two stop codons, 5'-CGGAATTCTCATTAGGCATGGAAGGGA-3'(SEQ ID NO:6). 
 The PCR was carried out for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 OC (denaturation), 1 min at 55 oC(annealing), and 1 min at 72 OC (polymerization), respectively. The DNA fragments WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 1 4 of about 250 bp, PCR products, were cloned into pBluescriptKS(2.9 kb, Stratagene, USA) by the reaction with T4 DNA ligase to construct a recombinant plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was used for the transformation of E.coli XL-IBlue. The transformed E.coli was incubated on LB(Luria Botani) plate with 100 pg/ml of ampicillin and selected by formed white colony. The plasmid extracted from the white colony was investigated using restriction map analysis and DNA sequence analysis(ALF system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, USA), and thus confirmed that the DNA fragment of 250 bp by PCR was Saxatilin cDNA. The EcoR I/Xho I fragment of the plasmid was cloned into the Cterminal region of the a-factor secretory signal protein of an expression vector pPIC9(8.0kb), to give an expression vector comprising Saxatilin encoding cDNA, pPSAX(8.3 kbp)(see: Figure 2). 
 The pPSAX was digested with Sall to give a linear DNA fragment and dissolved in TE buffer at a concentration of pg/tl, which was then mixed with 80 pl of Pichia pastoris GS115 competent cell(Invitrogen, USA) to perform transformation by electroporator(Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, USA) under a condition of 1.5 kV. The transformed cells were spread onto a histidine-deficient agar plate and incubated at 30 oC for 3 days. The selected colonies were inoculated to 1L of minimum glycerol media(100 mM sodium phosphate pH yeast nitrogen base 1.34%, biotin 4x 10-5%, glycerol and incubated at 30 °C until O.D 600 unit reaches to the level of 1.0. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 xg, and resuspended in the minimum methanol media(containing 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0, yeast nitrogen base 1.34%, biotin 4x 10-5%, methanol These cells were grown at 30 °C and induced the expression of recombinant Saxatilin. The cells were further incubated for 96 hr with the addition of 0.5% methanol at an interval of 24 hour, and it was confirmed that Saxatilin was accumulated in the media during the incubation period. The transformed cell WO 02/14488 PCT/KROO/00809 containing Saxatilin expression vector, pPSAX, was designated as "Pichia pastoris Y/pPSAX(Pichia pastoris Y/pPSAX)", and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms(KCCM, Hongje-l-dong 361-221, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea), an international depository authority as accession No. KCCM-10201 on July 21, 2000. 
 For the purification of Saxatilin, the supernatant obtained from cell broth by the centrifugation at 5,000 xg was applied to a phenyl Sepharose column of 1.3 x Rad, USA) equilibrated with 1.5 M ammonium sulfate solution, and eluted with 1 M ammonium sulfate solution at a flow rate of 20 ml/hour to obtain active fractions of Saxatilin. 
 The activity of Saxatilin was determined in a similar manner as in Example 1. The active fractions were loaded into HPLC column(source 30 RPC column, 7.8 x 300mm) equilibrated in distillated water with TFA, and eluted by the linear gradient of 0 to 50%(v/v) acetonitrile to give pure Saxatilin with a purification yield of 107 mg/L. 
 Example 7: Inhibition of platelet aggregation by recombinant Saxatilin Recombinant Saxatilin obtained in Example 6 was assayed by the platelet aggregation inhibition method described in Example 1, and compared with those of wildtype Saxatilin obtained in Example 1 and GRGDSP(SEQ ID NO:7)(see: Table respectively. 
 As shown in Table 1 below, the recombinant Saxatilin represented the comparable platelet aggregation inhibitory activity with the wild-type Saxatilin. 
 Table 1: IC 50 determined by platelet aggregation inhibition assay S Inhibitor ICs 0 (nM) Wild-type 136 WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 16 Saxatilin Recombinant 139 Saxatilin GRGDSP (SEQ ID 270 x NO: 7) Example 8: Anti-platelet aggregation activity of Saxatilin When a mixture of collagen and epinephrine was injected into mice intravenously, thrombus was formed in pulmonary artery, which led to paralysis, dilation of pupil, laboring breath and convulsions, and finally 70% of the mice died not more than 5 min. Thus, it was investigated whether the intravenous injection of recombinant Saxatilin could reduce the thrombosis symptoms. 
 At 10 minutes after Saxatilin(0, 0.1, 0.25 and mg/kg dissolved in 0.1 ml PBS, respectively) was intravenously injected into the tails of ICR mice, the mixture of collagen and epinephrine(120 gg collagen and 12 p g epinephrine in 0.lml PBS) was also injected into the tails of ICR mice, intravenously, and the viability was determined(see: Table 2). 
 Table 2 Saxatilin (mg/kg) 0 0.1 0.25 Treatment Mortal group 18/20 16/20 11/20 3/20 /Total group Viability 10 20 55 As shown in Table 2, based on the results that the treatment of Saxatilin caused the increase in viability, Saxatilin was supposed to suppress the coagulation induced by collagen and epinephrine, with more potent inhibitory activity in case of pre-treatment than post-treatment. 
 .1 WO 02/14488 PCT/KROO/00809 1 7 Example 9: Effect of recombinant Saxatilin on human umbilical vein endothelial cell(HUVEC) It has been known that disintegrins containing RGD sequence which is a part of recombinant Saxatilin(49-51 amino acid sequence), suppress the bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell growth. To investigate whether recombinant Saxatilin containing RGD sequence inhibits the endothelial cell proliferation, proliferation inhibition assay was performed using HUVEC. The activity of Saxatilin was compared with that of Salmosin(SEQ ID NO:10), which is known to inhibit the bFGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. 
 HUVEC was cultured on 24-well microplate coated with gelatin at 37 °C for 24 hr under an environment of 5% CO 2 After the media was replaced with 0.25 ml DMEM containing fetal bovine serum, recombinant Saxatilin obtained from Example 6 and Salmosin were added in a concentration of 0, 20, and 30 pg/ml, respectively. Then, cells were further incubated for 20 min and treated with 1 ng/ml of bFGF solution. After incubation of 72 hr, cells were trypsinized and the cell numbers were counted to determine cell viability(see: Figure As shown in Figure 3, Saxatilin inhibited the HUVEC growth in a dose-dependent manner similarly as Salmosin. 
 Example 10: Inhibition of HUVEC adhesion by Saxatilin To confirm that inhibition of HUVEC proliferation by Saxatilin is due to the direct interaction of Saxatilin with Vitronectin receptor, aVP3 integrin, localized on the HUVEC surface, it was investigated whether Saxatilin blocks HUVEC from binding to Vitronectin-coated 96-well plate. 
 96-well plate was coated with recombinant Saxatilin obtained in Example 6(1 Jg/well) as well as Mg/well) which were dissolved in phosphate buffered WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 18 saline(PBS) for 16 hr at 4°C. After washing the plate, mg/ml of heat-treated bovine serum albumin(BSA) was added for blocking of uncharged protein binding site. The plate was incubated for 1 hr and washed with PBS. HUVEC was trypsinized and washed with PBS three times, and then, resuspended in serum-free DMEM. 5 x 10 4 cells were mixed with anti-aVP 3 monoclonal antibody, a synthesized RGD peptide, GRGDSP(SEQ ID NO:7), a synthesized RGE peptide, GRGETP(SEQ ID NO:8) and Saxatilin, and pre-incubated for min at 37°C. Then, the mixture was added to the wells of both Saxatilin and Vitronectin-coated 96-well plate. After 1 hr of incubation at 37 0 C under an environment of 5% CO 2 the plate was washed with PBS to remove unbound cells, and bound cells were fixed and stained with Coomassie blue. 
 Optical absorbences of the wells were measured at 540nm to count relative cell numbers(see: Figures 4a and 4b). 
 As shown in Figures 4a and 4b, pre-incubation of bFGF-stimulated HUVEC with GRGDSP(SEQ ID NO:7), Saxatilin and anti-aV03 monoclonal antibody prevented HUVEC from adhering to Vitronectin(see: Figure 4a) and Saxatilin(see: Figure 4b) as well, indicating that Saxatilin inhibited integrin-mediated cell adhesion by binding with aVP3 integrin on HUVEC surface. 
 Example 11: Effect of Saxatilin on angiogenesis by chick chorioallantoic membrane(CAM) assay Chick chorioallantoic membrane(CAM) assay, a simulated in vivo model, was carried out to examine the effect of Saxatilin on bFGF-stimulated angiogenesis. A part of the rind of fertilized 3-day-old egg was broken carefully, and sealed with transparent tape, and incubated for 10 days at 37 0 C under an environment of 60% humidity. 
 Then, bFGF was applied to the chick chorioallantoic membrane(CAM) of individual embryo(6 ng/embryo) to induce angiogenesis. After further incubation of 24 hr, PBS as a negative control and 5 gg recombinant Saxatilin obtained WO 02/14488 PCT/KROO/00809 19 from Example 6 were applied to CAM, respectively. At 72 hr after treatment, the blood vessels of embryos were observed(see: Figures 5a and 5b). As shown in Figures and 5b, PBS showed no effect(see: Figure 5a) while Saxatilin had an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis(see: Figure Example 12: Inhibitory effect of Saxatilin on metastatic tumor growth Disintegrins suppress the lung tumor colony formation by preventing tumor cells from adhering to endothelial cells. However, it has never been reported that disintegrins inhibit the metastatic tumor promotion. 
 Therefore, it was investigated whether Saxatilin has an effect on the metastatic tumor growth. 
 1 x 106 Lewis lung carcinoma cells(purchased from American Type Cell Culture, Rockville, Md, USA) were injected into the tails of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice(Charles river, Japan), intravenously. At 4 day after injection, recombinant Saxatilin obtained from Example 6 was periodically applied to mice by intravenous injection in an amount of 1.25 mg/kg/day(once per day). After 4weeks of periodical treatment, tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed, and the number of tumor colony was counted by using stereomicroscope. As a result, it was clearly demonstrated that Saxatilin potently inhibited the metastatic tumor growth(see: Table 3). 
 Table 3: Suppression of metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma growth by Saxatilin Saxatilin Number of Average Inhibition (mg/kg mouse) tested mice colony number rate 0 4 15± 6 0 1.25 4 0.7± 0.6 WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 2 0 The suppression of metastatic tumor growth by Saxatilin was ascribed to the anti-angiogenesis effect of Saxatilin, which potently inhibited the bFGF-stimulated BCE cell proliferation by blocking of aV33 integrin function essential for angiogenesis. In addition, Saxatilin showed no toxicity on tested mice. 
 Furthermore, to observe the direct effect of Saxatilin on the metastatic lung carcinoma, histochemical study was carried out. Tumor-bearing lung tissue was fixed in paraffin in accordance with the conventionally known method followed by treatment of Bouin's solution for 4 hours. The tissue section of 4 im thickness was infiltrated with trypsin at 37 OC for 10 min and washed with PBS. The tissue section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and then mounted(see: Figures 6a, 6b and 6c). 
 Figure 6a is a photograph showing lung tissue without Lewis lung carcinoma cell; Figure 6b, lung tissue implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma cell and then treated with PBS; and, Figure 6c, lung tissue implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma cell and then treated with Saxatilin. As shown in Figures 6b and 6c, the metastatic tumor growth was observed in control group treated with PBS evidently(see: Figure 6b), while not observed in Saxatilin-administered group(see: Figure 6c). As illustrated as above, it was assumed that the suppression of metastatic tumor growth in Saxatilintreated mice was due to blockade of Saxatilin against angiogenesis, which was essential for the secondary tumor growth. 
 Administration and Effective Dose The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, which comprises an active ingredient of Saxatilin and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be administered as an injectable form. The injectable form may further comprise sterilized isotonic aqueous solution or suspension, and the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier ~m WO 02/14488 PCT/KR00/00809 21 covers preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for changing osmotic pressure or buffers. 
 Though the effective dose of Saxatilin is variable depending on age, body weight of the patient and progression of the disease, it is preferable to administer parenterally 20 to 52mg/60kg/day in a single dose for the treatment of thrombosis, and 30 to 120mg/60kg/day in a single dose for the treatment of cancer, which may be individualized by experience of the skilled in the art. 
 Acute Toxicity To examine the acute toxicity of Saxatilin as antiplatelet aggregation agent and anti-tumor agent, Saxatilin was injected into male C57BL/6 mouse subcutaneously and the dead were counted to determine LDo for 7 days. As a result, 
 LD 
 50 was determined as about 1100mg/kg, indicating that the anti-platelet aggregation agent and anti-tumor agent comprising Saxatilin were sufficiently safe within the range of the effective dose. 
 As clearly illustrated and demonstrated as aboves, the present invention provides Saxatilin, a protein derived from the venom of a Korean snake, Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov, a process for preparing the same, anti-platelet aggregation agent and anti-tumor agent comprising an active ingredient of Saxatilin. The present inventors purified Saxatilin from the venom of Agkistrodon saxatilis emelianov, cloned cDNA encoding Saxatilin, and constructed a recombinant expression vector comprising the cDNA and a recombinant microorganism transformed with the recombinant expression vector which expresses Saxatilin, and prepared Saxatilin by culturing the recombinant microorganism. 
 Saxatilin effectively suppresses the platelet aggregation and angiogenesis of tumor cells, which makes possible its practical application as an active ingredient of anti-platelet agent and anti-tumor agent.
