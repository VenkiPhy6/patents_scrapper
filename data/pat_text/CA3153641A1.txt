More specifically, the present invention relates to the cell-based production of bacterial nonulosonates and their biosynthetic precursors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  Nonulosonic sugars are a family of nine-carbon a-keto acids that are predominantly found on the outer surfaces of both eukaryotic and bacterial cells. Sialic acid (see Figure 1), which is the best characterized member of this family, plays a crucial role in animal physiology; for this reason, sialic acid and its derivatives have been extensively used as drug targeting molecules (Javant et al, 2007), anti-viral drugs (von ltzstein, 2007), cell-imaging agents (Mahal et al, 1997;  Hsu et al, 2007), and as supplements in nutraceuticals (Colombo et al, 2003;  Wang et al, 2007). Two other structurally distinct nonulosonic sugars, pseudaminic (Schoenhofen et al, 2006a) (Pse) and legionamlnic (Schoenhofen et al, 2009) (Leg) acid (Figure 1), and their biosynthetic pathways have also been characterized. These sialic acid-like sugars are constituents of microbial glycans, which are associated with important virulence factors, including flagella (McNally et al, 2007), capsules (Kiss et al, 2001), and lipopolysaccharides (Knirel et al, 2003 (LPS). Many commensal, as well as pathogenic bacteria, notably Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter co/l, Clostridium botulinum, Escherichia coil 0161, Helicobacter pylori, Legions/la pneumophila, Vibrio parahaernolyticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, biosynthesize and decorate their surfaces with these nonulosonic acids, whose function(s) remains unclear. The structural similarities and evolutionary history (Lewis et al, 2009) shared between these three nonulosonic sugars has raised considerable interest in understanding the mammalian sialobiology associated with bacterial-derived Pse and Leg. The biosynthesis of Pse and Leg parallels that of sialic acid and involves the condensation of a 6-carbon amino sugar intermediate with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to generate the corresponding nonulosonate. In contrast to sialic acid biosynthesis in bacteria, which involves condensation of N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) with PEP, both Pse and Leg utilize unusual 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy hexoses (DAT01-1) for the synthase step.   Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 Pse is biosynthesized from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GIcNAc) in a five-step enzymatic transformation (Schoenhofen et al, 2006a) (see Table 1 and Figure 2). A  dedicated dehydratase (PseB) and aminotransferase (PseC) pair (Schoenhofen et al, 2006b), converts UDP-G1cNAc into UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-P-L-AltNAc. An acetyltransferase, PseH, and a UDP-sugar hydrolase, PseG, transform this UDP-activated sugar intermediate into 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-L-altropyranose (6-deoxy-AltdiNAc). The Pse synthase, Psel, performs the PEP-dependent condensation with 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc to liberate 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-L-manno-nonulosonic acid or pseudaminic acid. Table 1.

 2 Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 2006; Glaze et al, 2008; see Table 1 and Figure 2). Dehydratase PgIF and aminotransf erase PgIE pair (Schoenhofen et al, 2006b) convert 1.1013-GIcNAc into UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-a-D-GIcNAc. Acetyltransferase PgID and hydrolyzing 2-epimerase LegG transform this UDP-activated sugar intermediate into 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-mannopyranose (6-deoxy-MandiNAc). The Leg synthase, Legl, performs the PEP-dependent condensation with 6-deoxy-MandiNAc to liberate 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-D-giycero-D-galacto-nonulosonic acid (legionaminic acid). Enzymes functionally similar to PgIF, PgIE and PgID also exist, for example the C. jejuni LegB, LegC and LegH (respectively) enzymes, which produce identical sugar products except that they are GDP-linked biosynthetic intermediates (Schoenhofen et al, 2009). Here, PgIFED produce UDP-BacdiNAc starting from UDP-GIcNAc (see Table 1).  Similarly, certain LegG enzymes, as in C. jejuni, may utilize a GDP-linked substrate The bacterial nonulosonic acids are a medically and biotechnologically important family of cell-surface carbohydrates. Current methods for producing these complex sugars allows the isolation of only limited, sub-gram quantities from natural resources, or via currently available chemical or enzymatic synthesis in vitro. Additionally, the cost of enzyme preparation, reagents and cofactors required for in vitro synthesis is quite significant. There remains a need in the art for a method that can generate significant quantities of Pse and Leg in a cost-effective manner.

The detailed description and examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, as various changes and    . modifications within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the teachings of this invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other features of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the appended drawings, wherein: FIGURE 1 shows the structures of sialic acid and sialic acid-like sugars.  Sialic acid (Neu5Ac; D-glycero-D-galacto configuration), pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac; L-glycero-L-manno configuration), legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7Ac; D-glycero-D-galacto configuration), 4-epi-legionaminic acid (4eLeg5Ac7Ac; D-glycero-D-talo configuration), and 8-epi-legionaminic acid (8eLeg5Ac7Ac; L-glycero-D-galacto configuration) are shown. For reference, the 9 carbon atoms of sialic acid are numbered, and the functional groups that are different than those present on sialic acid-like sugars are circled. Moreover, stereochemical differences of bacterial sialic acid-like sugars to that of sialic acid are indicated by numbering of the respective carbon centers. FIGURE 2 shows the production pathway for pseudaminic acid, legionaminic acid, and UDP-activated 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy hexoses (DATDH), specifically UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc or UDP-BacdiNAc, by metabolically engineered E. coll. The non-native, yeast-derived enzymes, Agm1 and Uap1, were used to activate exogenously fed GIcNAc into UDP-GIcNAc.  This substrate then entered either pseudaminic acid or legionaminic acid biosynthesis via PseBCHGI  or PgIFED/LegGI, respectively.

These ion extraction peaks were not present in the negative control production culture (data not shown). To confirm that these m/z values are derived from authentic Pseudaminic acid, cell-free broth from the negative control culture was spiked with Pseudaminic acid standard.

The epimerization at C2 by LegG  generates a 2-acetamido-6-deoxy mannose intermediate (6-deoxy-MandiNAc) that is not likely accepted by the NagA/NagB catabolic pathway, but instead has to undergo a second epimerization at C2 via NanE to generate a degradable sugar adduct.

The recombinant cell does not include naturally-occurring cells that produce pseudaminic or legionaminic acid (such as EscherIchla coil 0161), but does include naturally-occurring cells in which the production of pseudaminic or legionaminic acid has been increased, improved, or enhanced by engineering to comprise the enzymes listed herein. In a specific, non-limiting example, the recombinant cell may be an Escherichia coil cell. The recombinant cells described herein may be part of a cell-based system for producing the legionaminic acid, pseudaminic acid, or respective biosynthetic precursors. By the term "cell-based system", it is meant that the recombinant strains described herein are one component and others may be included. Components of the system may include, but are not limited to the recombinant cells described herein, culture medium (also referred to herein as "growth medium"), and supplements. The culture medium may be any suitable culture medium; as would be known to those skilled in the biochemical arts, the choice of culture medium may be based on the type of recombinant cell. Without wishing to be limiting in any manner, supplements to the culture medium may include palmitate. In an alternative to supplementation with palmitate, the recombinant cell may further comprise overexpression of a gene encoding acetyl-CoA  synthetase, where the enzyme joins acetate and coenzyme A (CoA) to form acetyl-CoA (Lin et al., 2006).

Pse may further comprise an inactivated sialic acid transporter gene, and/or an inactivated sialic acid aldolase gene. As would be understood by those of skill in the art, the source of the inactivated genes will be dependent on the type of recombinant cell used. By the term "inactivated", it is meant that the gene does not encode a functional product.  The gene may be rendered inactive by any suitable method known in the art, for example, but not limited to partial or complete deletion of the gene DNA, or insertion of additional DNA within the gene (resulting in the inability to produce a functional gene product or enzyme).

The recombinant cell for production of Leg also comprises genes encoding GIcNAc-6-P mutase and GIcNAc-1-P  uridyltransferase (Table 2 and Figure 2). The GicNAc-6-P mutase and GIcNAc-1-P    uridyltransferase genes may be from any suitable source; as would be known to those of skill in the art, many biological sources comprise GIcNAc-6-P mutase or GIcNAc-1-P  uridyltransferase genes, and any of these may be used in the present invention. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, the genes may be from S. cerevisiae, C.  albicans, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, or any other suitable source. Additionally, and similarly to the recombinant cell used for production of Pse, the recombinant cell used for production of Leg comprises an inactivated GIcNAc-6-P  deacetylase gene, described in Table 2. As would be understood by those of skill in the art, the source of the inactivated genes will be dependent on the type of recombinant cell used.  Optionally, the recombinant cell for producing Leg may either have an inactivated sialic acid transporter gene, an inactivated sialic acid aldolase gene, an inactivated ManNAc-6-P epimerase gene (for example, nanE), an inactivated undecaprenyl-P/UDP-GIcNAc transferase gene (for example, wecA), or a combination thereof. NanE may be responsible for depletion of intermediates in the Leg biosynthetic pathway (specifically 6-deoxy-MandiNAc), while WecA may be responsible for the depletion of Intermediates in the Leg biosynthetic pathway (specifically UDP-BacdiNAc). In a specific, non-limiting example, the recombinant cell for production of legionaminic acid is an E. coil cell comprising an inactivated sialic acid transporter gene (nanT;  encoding SEQ ID   Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 NO:14), an inactivated sialic acid aldolase gene (nanA; encoding SEQ ID  NO:15), an inactivated GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase gene (nagA; encoding SEQ ID NO:16), a gene encoding C.  jejuni PgIF  (SEQ ID NO:6), a gene encoding C. jejuni PgIE (SEQ ID NO:7), a gene encoding C. jejuni PgID  (SEQ ID NO:8), a gene encoding C. jejuni Legl (SEQ ID NO:9), a gene encoding L. pneurnophila LegG (SEQ ID NO:11), a gene encoding S. cerevisiae GIGNAc-6-P mutase (Agm1;  SEQ ID  NO:12), and the S. cerevislae gene uapl (encoding a GIcNAc-1-P  uridyltransferase; SEQ ID  NO:13).

Similarly, the present invention provides a cell-based fermentation method for the production of legionaminic acid, comprising growing the recombinant cell as described above (for the production of Leg) and recovering the produced legionaminic acid. By the term "cell-based fermentation method", it is meant that microorganisms are used in a fermentation process; in the present case, the microorganisms are the recombinant cells of the present invention. The fermentation process may occur under aerobic or anaerobic conditions;  specific methods and conditions for cell-based fermentation may vary based on the type of recombinant cell, and are well-known in the art. The fermentation process may also be conducted as either a batch or a continuous process. In the batch process, the recombinant cells are mixed in an aqueous suspension of growth medium and optionally supplements, and placed under an atmosphere that includes or excludes oxygen. In a continuous mode, the aqueous suspension of the recombinant cells and medium is circulated through the fermentor at a constant flow rate, such that the volume in the fermentation vessel is constant; at steady state, the growth rate of the cells is equal to the dilution rate. The final product, legionaminic acid or pseudaminic acid, may be recovered from the culture medium or cell lysates by any suitable method known in the art. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, the legionaminic acid or pseudaminic acid may be recovered by conventional chromatography utilizing, for example, preparative fast performance liquid chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography (FPLC/HPLC) instruments, or recovered by precipitation and/or recrystallization approaches. In a batch fermentation Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 process, the final product may be recovered at the end of the process; in a continuous process, the final product may be recovered continuously or at various time points. The present invention also provides recombinant cells and methods for production of legionaminic and pseudaminic acid precursors, also referred to herein as UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy hexoses (UDP-DATDHs). Specifically, the present invention provides a recombinant cell for the production of UDP-DATDHs such as the pseudaminic acid biosynthetic precursor UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-I3-L-altropyranose (UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc) and the legionaminic acid biosynthetic precursor UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-a-D-glucopyranose (UDP-BacdiNAc). UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-3-L-altropyranose, also referred to herein as UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc, is a pseudaminic acid biosynthetic precursor; it can be converted to Pse by the actions of PseG and Psel enzymes.

The source of the Pse genes described above may be from any suitable source, including a biological source capable of producing UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, the genes may be from H. pylori, C. jejuni, or any other suitable source. The source of the GIcNAc-6-P mutase gene, and the GIcNAc-1-P uridyltransferase genes inserted into the recombinant cell for the production of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc are as described above for the recombinant cell for the production of pseudaminic acid. Additionally, the recombinant cell used for production of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc comprises an inactivated GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase gene, described in Table 2.

In a specific, non-limiting example, the recombinant cell for production of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc is an E coil' cell comprising an inactivated sialic acid transporter gene (nanT, encoding SEQ ID  NO:14), an inactivated sialic acid aldolase gene (nanA; encoding SEQ ID  NO:15), an inactivated GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase gene (nagA; encoding SEQ ID NO:16), a gene encoding H.  pylori PseB    Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 (SEQ ID NO:1), a gene encoding H. pylon PseC (SEQ ID NO:2), a gene encoding H.  pylori PseH  (SEQ ID NO:3), a gene encoding S. cerevisiaeGIcNAc-6-P mutase (Agm1; SEQ ID  NO:12), and the S. cerevisiae gene uapl (encoding a GicNAc-1-P uridyltransferase; SEQ ID  NO:13); one specific, non-limiting example is construct BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL151, described herein. UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-a-D-glucopyranose, also referred to herein as UDP-BacdiNAc, is a legionaminic acid biosynthetic precursor; UDP-BacdiNAc can be converted to Leg by the actions of LegG and Legl enzymes. The recombinant cell for production of UDP-BacdiNAc comprises genes encoding PgIF, PgIE, and Pg1D enzyme functions (Table 1 and Figure 2); the recombinant cell for producing UDP-BacdiNAc also comprises a gene encoding GIcNAc-6-P mutase and a gene encoding a GIcNAc-1-P uridyltransferase (Table 2 and Figure 2). The source of the Pgl genes described above may be from any suitable source, including a biological source capable of producing UDP-BacdiNAc. For example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, the genes may be from C. jejuni, L. pneumophila, or any other suitable source. The source of the GIcNAc-6-P mutase gene and the GIcNAc-1-P  uridyltransferase gene inserted into the recombinant cell for the production of UDP-BacdiNAc are as described above for the recombinant cell for the production of legionaminic acid. Additionally, the recombinant cell used for production of UDP-BacdiNAc comprises an inactivated GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase gene, described in Table 2. Optionally, the recombinant cell for producing UDP-BacdiNAc comprises an inactivated sialic acid transporter gene, and/or an inactivated sialic acid aldolase gene, and/or an inactivated undecaprenyl-P/UDP-GIcNAc transf erase gene. As would be understood by those of skill in the art, the source of the inactivated genes will be dependent on the type of recombinant cell used. In a specific, non-limiting example, the recombinant cell for production of UDP-BacdiNAc is an E. coif cell comprising an inactivated sialic acid transporter gene (nanT;  encoding SEQ ID NO:14), an inactivated sialic acid aldolase gene (nanA; encoding SEQ ID  NO:15), and an inactivated GIcNAG-6-P deacetylase gene (nag4; encoding SEQ ID NO:16); the recombinant cell also comprises a gene encoding C. jejuni PgIF (SEQ ID NO:6), a gene encoding C. jejuni PgIE (SEQ ID NO:7), and a gene encoding C. jejuni PgID (SEQ ID NO:8), a gene encoding S.  cerevisiae GIcNAc-6-P mutase (Agm1; SEQ ID NO:12), and the S. cerevisiae gene uapl (encoding a GIcNAc-1-P uridyltransferase; SEQ ID NO:13). The bacterial cell may additionally comprise an inactivated undecaprenyl-P/UDP-GIcNAc transferase gene (wecA;  encoding SEQ  ID NO:18); one specific, non-limiting example is construct BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL152, described herein. In another non-limiting example, the recombinant strain is IDAC  deposit No. 060411-01.   Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 The present invention also provides a cell-based fermentation method for the production of UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-13-L-altropyranose (UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc), comprising growing the recombinant cell as described above and recovering the produced UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc. The present invention further provides a cell-based fermentation method for the production of UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-a-D-glucopyranose (UDP-BacdiNAc), comprising growing the recombinant cell as described above and recovering the produced UDP-BacdiNAc. The enzymes and genes described in the above bacterial cells for the production of precursor compounds are as described previously above. Similarly, conditions for the methods just described are as indicated above for the production of the final products.  Methods for recovering the products are as described herein. The precursors, UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc and UDP-BacdiNAc, obtained using the recombinant cells and methods above, may be converted to pseudaminic acid and legionaminic acid, respectively. Methods for conversion of these precursors to the final product are well known in the art. For example, UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc may be converted to pseudaminic acid by incubation in a reaction vessel comprising a UDP-sugar hydrolase (PseG), a pseudaminic acid synthase (Psel), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or pyruvate. Alternatively, UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc sugar could be converted to 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc with PseG, which may be chemically modified as described by Lee et al. (2010), to produce pseudaminic acid. As well, UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc may be converted to 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc by chemical methods (such as heat or acidic treatment), and then converted to pseudaminic acid with Psel and PEP/pyruvate or the chemical methods described above. Similarly, UDP-BacdiNAc may be converted to legionaminic acid by incubating it in a reaction vessel comprising a UDP-sugar hydrolase and 2-epimerase (LegG), a legionaminic acid synthase (Legl) or sialic acid aldolase, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or pyruvate. Alternatively, the UDP-BacdiNAc may be converted to Leg by chemi-enzymatic methods similar to above (Tsvetkov et al., 2001). Optionally, the Pse and Leg sugars produced by the methods described herein may be further converted to respective CMP-activated sugars with the CMP-pseudaminic acid synthetase (PseF; Schoenhofen et al, 2006a) and CMP-legionaminic acid synthetase (LegF;  Schoenhofen et al, 2009), respectively. PseF catalyzes the reaction [CTP + pseudaminic acid -3 CMP-pseudaminic acid + pyrophosphate], whereas LegF catalyzes the reaction [CTP +  legionaminic acid -3 CMP-Iegionaminic acid + pyrophosphate]. The conversion to CMP-sugars may be accomplished by any suitable method in the art, for example either by co-expression within Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 recombinant cells (i.e. PseBCHGIF or PgIFED/LegGIF strains), mixing of separate recombinant cells (i.e. PseBCHGI + PseF, or PgIFED/LegGI + LegF), or by in vitro synthesis after their isolation (Pse or Leg) using methods known to those skilled in the art. The PseF and LegF  enzymes may be from any suitable source; for example, and without wishing to be limiting in any manner, the genes may be from H. pylori, C. jejuni, C. coil, P. aeruginosa, L  pneumophila, or any other suitable source. Methods of producing such CMP-activated sugars are encompassed by the present invention. To produce pseudaminic acid, the complete Pse-blosynthetic pathway and UDP-GIcNAc generating enzymes Agm1 and Uap1 were introduced into an E. coil strain (BRL02) previously .. engineered for the synthesis of sialic acid (Example 3). This system failed to produce significant levels of Pse or Pse-pathway intermediates. The extremely low productivity was attributed to the degradation of the Agm1/Uap1/PseBCHGI- pathway substrate, GIcNAc-6-P, via NagA  (GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase). Therefore, the pseBCHG1 and agml/uapl genes were introduced into the dnagA E. coil strain BRLO4 (Example 3). However, co-transformation of the PseBCHGI pathway and Agm1/Uap1 proteins as a hepta-cistronic operon, encoded on a single vector (pBRL179), into the AnagA strain BRLO4 failed to produce viable clones on every attempt. The pseBCHG1-agml-uspl operon is controlled by a 17 promoter, and it is widely accepted that leaky expression results from T7 promoters (Studier et al, 1990). The failure to co-transform the Pse-biosynthetic pathway and Agm1/Uap1 proteins into the AnagA strain BRLO4 was due to a toxicity associated with the leaky expression of the pseBCHGlIagm uapl genes.  Independent transformations of either the pseBCHG1 or agml/uapl genes were successful in generating viable clones, which indicated that neither pathway alone is toxic in the AnagA strain. Only a combination of both sets of genes was required for toxicity (Example 3). By splitting the hepta-cistronic PseBCHGI/Agm1/Uap1 system into two operons, pseBCHG 1 and agm 1 I  tiap1, on two separate, 17-controlled expression vectors (pBRL175 and pBRL178) with different replication origins, viable BRL04IpseBCHG1lagmlluap1 clones were generated. Analysis of cell-free culture broth from these BRLO4lpseBCHG1lagmlluapl cells (i.e. two operon system above) in a glycerol/GicNAc-batch fermentation by LCMS ESI+ (Figure 7A) indicated pseudaminic acid production (Example 3). The sub-optimal production of the Pse product and pathway intermediates in some engineered strains (BRL02, BL21(DE3), BRL25; Examples 3 and 5) suggested that either the acetyl-CoA  levels were suboptimal due to an additional N-acetylation required relative to sialic acid biosynthesis; that the intermediates in the Pse-biosynthetic pathway were being consumed by Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 undesirable intracellular glycosylation reactions; or that intermediates were degraded by unidentified mechanisms. Removal of all non-essential glycosylation reactions in the engineered E. coil strain (BRL25) did not have an effect on the production of pseudaminic acid (Example 6). The only dissimilation pathway in E. coil K-12 for 2-acetamido sugars (Plumridge & Vimr, 1999) involves a highly specific process that includes a deacetylase, NagA, and a deaminase, NagB (Plumridge & Vimr, 1999). The deacetylase, NagA, removes the acetate at C2 of N-acetyl glucosamine-6-phosphate (GIcNAc-6-P) to generate glucsosamine-6-phosphate (GIcN-6-P);  NagB then deaminates GIcN-6-P into fructose-6-phosphate, which then enters central metabolism. This pathway may be responsible for catabolizing the Pse-biosynthetic pathway intermediates, which have the same configuration at C2, thus preventing the production of pseudaminic acid. Only when the GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase, NagA, was deleted was Pse readily produced (Example 3). It is therefore possible that the native E coil pathway for the degradation of N-acetylglucosamine is in fact able to catabolize 2-acetamido-6-deoxy hexoses such as 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-L-altropyranose (6-deoxy-AltdiNAc). The present invention will be further illustrated in the following examples.  However, it is to be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner. Example 1: Construction of recombinant pathway for pseudaminic acid, UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc, and UDP-BacdiNAc biosynthesis Plasmids encoding the H. pylori pseB, pseC, psel-f and psel genes, and the C.  jejuni pseG gene were provided by the Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The plasmids were used as templates for PCR with the primers given in Table 3. Initial constructions of H. pylori pseB, pseC, pseH and pseG genes On a pseBGHGloperon) examined via Western blot of cell lysates showed that the H. pylori PseB, PseC  and PseH were successfully expressed but not PseG (data not shown). Therefore, the C. jejuni PseG was cloned and used in place of H. pylori PseG. The pgIF, pgiE and pg1D genes were amplified from C. jejuni (ATCC  700819-5) genomic DNA  using primers also shown in Table 3. Table 3. Forward (f) and reverse (r) primers used for amplification of pse and pgi genes, shown with restriction sites.

The sub-cloning of genes and construction of recombinant expression vectors described in this and following Examples was done using standard molecular biology techniques (Erbel et al, 2003). A full pseudaminic acid biosynthetic pathway was constructed using genes encoding the proteins PseB (HP0840; SEQ ID NO:1), PseC (HP0366; SEQ ID NO:2), PseH (HP0327; SEQ ID  NO:3), and Psel (HP0178; SEQ ID NO:4) from H. pylori and PseG (011312; SEQ ID NO: 5) from C.  jejuni. This set of enzymes was shown to synthesize Pse from UDP-GIcNAc in vitro (Schoenhofen et al, 2006a). The pseBCHGloperon was constructed by sequentially cloning the Xba I-Avr II fragment of the targeted downstream gene(s) into the Avr II of the parental vector, yielding a low-copy expression vector and arranged into a penta-cistronic operon, controlled by a single 17 promoter (pBR1.175; Table 4). The UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc biosynthetic pathway was constructed using genes encoding the proteins PseB (HP0840; SEQ ID NO:1), PseC (HP0366; SEQ ID NO:2), and PseH  (HP0327;  SEQ ID NO:3) from H. pylori. This set of enzymes was shown to synthesize UDP-6-deoxy-Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 AltdiNAc from UDP-GIcNAc in vitro (Schoenhofen et al, 2006a; Schoenhofen et al, 2006b).  Construction of the pseBCH operon was achieved by sequentially cloning the Xba I-Avr II  fragment of the targeted downstream gene(s) into the Avr II of the parental vector, resulting in a low-copy expression vector and arranged into a tri-cistronic operon, controlled by a single T7 promoter (pBRL151, Table 4). The UDP-BacdiNAc biosynthetic pathway was constructed using genes encoding the proteins PgIF (Cj1120c SEQ ID NO:6), PgIE (Cj1121c SEQ ID NO:7), and PgID (Cj1123c SEQ  ID NO:8) from C. jejuni. This set of enzymes was shown to synthesize UDP-BacdiNAc from UDP-GIcNAc in vitro (Schoenhofen et al, 2006b; Oliver et al, 2006). Construction of the pgIFED operon was achieved by sequentially cloning the Xba I-Avr II fragment of the targeted downstream gene(s) into the Avr II of the parental vector, resulting in a low-copy expression vector and arranged into a tri-cistronic operon, controlled by a single T7 promoter (pBRL152, Table 4). Resulting plasmids, listed in Table 4, may be used for the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid (Pse), legionaminic acid (Leg) and their precursors UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc and UDP-BacdiNAc, respectively. Table 4. Plasmids used for the production of UDP-GIcNAc, pseudaminic acid (Pse), UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-a-D-glucopyranose (UDP-BacdiNAc) and UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-6-L-altropyranose (UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc) Biosynthesized Plasmid         Operon               Metabolite pBRL179         pseBCHGI- agm 1- uap1    Pse             See Example 3 pBRL175         pseBCHGI             Pse                 See Example 3 pBRL151         pseBCH               UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc See Example 5 pBRL152         pgIFED               UDP-BacdiNAc        See Example 5 pBRL178         agml-uapl            UDP-GIcNAc          See Example 2 Example 2: Cloning of a UDP-GicNAc biosynthetic pathway The Pse-biosynthetic pathway diverges from E. coil metabolism at the key branch point UDP-GIcNAc, the synthesis of which is tightly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms (Plumbridge et al, 1993). To circumvent the dependency of Pse/Leg or UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAdUDP-BacdiNAc production from UDP-GIcNAc supplied only by homeostasis, a foreign, yeast-derived UDP-Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 GIcNAc biosynthetic pathway was co-expressed with the Pse or UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc/UDP-BacdiNAc biosynthetic pathways. The genes encoding the enzymes for a GIcNAc-6-P mutase (Hofmann et al, 1994), Agm1 (SEQ  ID NO:12), and a GIcNAc-1-P uridyltransferase (Mio et al, 1998), Uap1 (SEQ ID  NO:13), were cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For E. coil, exogenously-fed GIcNAc is taken up by PTS-transporters, i.e., ManXYZ and/or NagE (GIcNAc-inducible), to generate intracellular GlcNAc-6-P, which can only be degraded into Fru-6-P in wild-type E. coll.  Expression of the non-native Agm1/Uap1 pathway enabled GIcNAc-6-P to be directly converted to UDP-GIcNAc, bypassing E. coil central metabolism and generating higher pools of UDP-GIcNAc for Pse, Leg, UDP-BacdiNAc, and UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc production. The agml (GIcNAc-6-P mutase) and uapl (GIcNAc-1-P uridyltransferase) from S.  cerevisiae were previously cloned into the expression vector pKH22 as a bi-cistronic operon controlled by a 17-promoter, thus generating the plasmid pBRL80 (Lundgren, 2010). This system was highly productive in converting exogenously supplied GIcNAc into UDP-GicNAc (Lundgren, 2010). The Xba II Avr II agm 1 -uapl fragment from pBRL80 was sub-cloned into either the Awll site of pBRL175 (pseBCHG() or the Xba I site of pKH61 (Lundgren, 2010) to generate plasmids pBRL179 and pBRL178, respectively (Lundgren, 2010). The vector pBRL179 encoded all the necessary genes for channelling GicNAc into Pse production. In contrast, the pBRL178 supplied only the agml-uapl genes but could be readily co-expressed with the plasmid-encoded pathways for UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (pseBCH on pBRL151), Pse (pseBCHGI on pBRL175), or UDP-BacdiNAc (pgIFED on pBRL152), or Leg. Example 3: Pseudaminic acid production from E. coil For initial Pse production experiments, the PseBCHGI pathway was expressed in the commercially available, industrially-friendly E. coil BL21(DE3) strain.  Chemical transformation of plasmids into cells was performed using art-known methods. Because there was no known Pse-specific aldolase or degradation pathway for 2-acetamido-6-deoxy sugars encoded in the E. coil genome (Lewis et al, 2009), E. coil BL21(DE3) served as a desirable host for Pse production due to its robustness in gene expression. However, the BL21(DE3)/PseBCHGI strain failed to produce any detectable Pse from either glycerol or glucose batch fermentation (data not shown). Expression of the non-native pseBCHGI genes was not an issue, because the Pse-biosynthetic proteins were detected by Western blots of production-culture cell lysates derived from both minimal and complex media (data not shown).   Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 The Pse-biosynthetic pathway along with the Agm1 and Uapl genes (pBRL179, Example 1) were transformed into and co-expressed in the nanT nank E. constrain BRLO2 (Table 6) using method known in the art.; this strain was previously engineered for sialic acid production (Lundgren & Boddy, 2007). Pse production was performed using a mixed feeding strategy of glycerol/GIcNAc batch fermentations in shake-flasks. Glycerol supplied the cells with energy and biosynthetic precursors whereas GIcNAc fed into UDP-GIcNAc synthesis for Pse production. Briefly, starter cultures were grown in 1 mL of LB media, supplemented with the necessary antibiotics, at 37 C, 200 rpm, for 18 h. A 20 mL F2 minimal media (in 250-mL  shake-flask), supplemented with the necessary antibiotics, 0.25% casitone and 1% (v/v) glycerol was inoculated with 0.2 mL of starter culture. Production cultures were grown at 37 C, 200 rpm, until an OD600 of 0.5 was reached. At this point, pseudaminic acid production was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG (final concentration), and the incubation temperature was lowered to 30 C. Production cultures were grown for 72 h and supplemented with 0.6% (v/v) glycerol at 0, 12 and 36 h post induction. At 0, 18 and 36 h post induction, doses of 0.2% GIcNAc were added for pseudaminic acid biosynthesis/production. Expression of the hepta-cistronic operon of pBRL179 in E. coil strain BRLO2 produced a trace amount of Pse with m/z of 317 (M-OH), 335 (M+1-1), and 357 (M+Na), see Figure 5. The extremely low productivity was attributed to the degradation of the Agm1/Uap1/PseBCHGI-pathway substrate, GIcNAc-6-P, via NagA (GIcNAc-6-P deacetylase; SEO ID NO:  16). Therefore, the pseBCHG1 and agmlluapl genes In pBRL179 were introduced into the nanT  nank AnagA E. coil strain BRLO4 (Table 6); chemical transformation of plasmids into cells was performed using art-known methods. Cell culture and gene expression were performed as described above. Co-transformation of the PseBCHGI pathway and Agm1/Uap1 proteins as a hepta-cistronic operon encoded on a single vector, into the AnagA strain BRLO4 failed to produce viable clones on every attempt. The pse5CHG1-agml-uapi operon is controlled by a 17 promoter, and it is widely accepted that leaky expression results from 17 promoters (Studier et al, 1990). The failure to co-transform the Pse-biosynthetic pathway and Agm1/Uap1 proteins into the AnagA strain BRLO4 was due to a toxicity associated with the leaky expression of the pseBCHG1lagm 11 uapl genes. Independent transformations of either the pseBCHGI (in pBRL175) or agml/uapl genes (in pBRL178) using art-known chemical transformation methods were successful in generating viable clones (data not shown), indicating that neither pathway alone is toxic in the nanT nanA-Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 AnagA strain. Based on these results and those of Example 5, BRLO4 cells were transformed with pseEtCHG1 (in pBRL175) and agmlluapl (in pBRL178) using art-known chemical transformation methods, generating viable BRL04/pseBCHG1lagm1luap1 clones (strain BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL175). This clone was deposited with the International Depositary Authority of Canada (National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2) on April 7, 2011, under deposit number 060411-02. Cell culture and gene expression were performed as described above. The pseBCHGI and agmiluapi genes were present on plasmids with copy numbers (replication origins) of -20 (pMB1') and >100 (mutated ColE1), respectively (Hayes, 2003). Under non-induced conditions, the substantially higher copy number of the uapllagml operon out-competed the pseBCHGI  pathway for T7-polymerase mediated transcription. This increased the synthesis of UDP-GicNAc but did not raise its flux through Pse biosynthesis, thus keeping Pse-pathway intermediates at non-toxic levels. The cell-free culture broth was analyzed using a LCMS ESP- method developed herein (see Example 4). Analysis of cell-free culture broth from BRLO4IpseEICHG1lagmlivapl cells (strain BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL175) in a glycerol/GIcNAc-batch fermentation by LCMS ESI+  (Figure 7A) showed a clear ion-extraction peak for Pse with m/z values of 317(M-OH), 335 (WEI) and 357 (M+Na). These ion extraction peaks were not present in the negative control production culture (data not shown). To confirm that these m/z values were derived from authentic Pse, cell-free broth from the negative control culture was spiked with Pse standard. As shown in Figures 7A  and B, the ion-extraction peak of the spiked sample was identical to the Pse produced from the BRL04/ pseBCH011agrniluapl fermentation (strain BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL175).  Although a quantitative Pse titer could not be determined, a rough estimate based on the inability to detect Pse standards injected at concentrations of <40 mg Li, would imply that Pse production was at least    20 mg Li. Quantitative determination of Pse titers can be made by analyzing pseudaminic acid from cell-free culture broth derivatized with the fluorometric reagent, 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene (DMB) by HPLC (Lewis et al, 2009; Manzi at al, 1990).  This assay is widely used for sialic acid quantification and has been applied to Pse (Lewis et al, 2009). The production of Pse was further optimized by increasing the acetyl-CoA pools in the nanT  flank AnagA E. coil strain BRL04. Unlike sialic acid, Pse biosynthesis involves a diacetamido sugar that is generated from a dedicated acetyl-CoA dependent acetyltransferase, PseH. To Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 increase the acetyl-CoA levels in BRL04/pseBCHGVagm1/uap1 through 13-oxidation, cell culture of BRLO4 transformed with pBRL175 and pBRL178 was grown and gene expression was performed as described above except that production cultures were supplemented with 0.6 mg L-1 of palm itate. As indicated in Figure 8, Pse was readily produced and appeared to be higher than that without palmitate addition. This suggested that acetyl-CoA may be a factor for the production of diacetamido sugars in E. coll. Example 4: Analysis of pseudaminic acid and legionaminic acid from cell-free culture broth via LCMS ESI# Due to the failures with Pse detection using proton NMR, a LCMS ESI* method was developed and validated to detect Pse from production cultures of Example 3 (Figure 4). Briefly, cell-free broth from production cultures (Example 3) were diluted 100-fold into 0.1 mL of water and analyzed by LCMS ESP- (10 1.. injection volumes) on a Shimadzu LCMS  2010 A.  HPLC conditions: UV detection X = 210, 254 nm, Thermo 50 x 4.6 mm, 3 pm, HypercariP HPLC  column (graphitic carbon based packing), flow rate 0.15 mL/min, isocratic elution H20, 0.05% v/v formic over 20 min run time. Example 5: Production of UDP-activated 2,4-diacetamido-2.4.6-trideoxy hexoses from E. coli Plasmids pBRL151 (pseBCH) or pBRL152 (pgIFED) (Example 1; Table 4), encoding the biosynthetic pathways for the Pse precursor UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc or Leg precursor UDP-BacdiNAc (Figure 11), respectively, were transformed with pBRL178 (agml-uapl;  Example 2; Table 4) in the nanT nanA- nagA- E. coil strain BRLO4 (Table 6; WO  2008/097366) using art-known chemical transformation methods. The BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL173 strain was used as a negative control. To maximize cell density for the production of the UDP-DATDHs from shake-flasks, starter cultures were scaled up in 5-fold increments. Seed cultures of BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL151 or BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL152 were grown in 1 mL LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics at 37 C, 200 rpm, for 18 h. Afterwards, entire seed cultures were harvested, and the resulting cell pellets were re-suspended and diluted into 5 mL of LB with necessary antibiotics. Cultures were grow at 37 C, 200 rpm, for 18 h and then re-harvested. Cell pellets were used to inoculate 20 mL LB with appropriate antibiotics and grown at 37 C, 200 rpm, for 18 h. At this time, the entire 20 mL seed culture was harvested, and the cell mass was used to inoculate the production culture of 100 mL 2XYT (in 2-L flasks) supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) glycerol and necessary antibiotics. Production cultures were grown at 30 C, 250 rpm, until an  D600 of 5 was reached.    Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 At this point, UDP-DATDH production was induced with the addition of 0.3 mM  IPTG (final concentration), and cultures were grown at 30 C, 250 rpm, for 60 h. At t = 0, 12 and 36 h post induction, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol was added to the production cultures. To maximize UDP-DATDH  production, doses of 0.3% GIcNAc were supplied at t = 0, 12, 24 and 36 h post induction. At the end of the duration of the experiment, cultures were harvested and the resulting cell pellets were analyzed by capillary-electrophoresis-MS. To determine if the nanr nanAs AnagA E. coil strain can at least generate the necessary UDP-linked DATDH sugar for pseudaminic and legionaminic acid production, the agml/uapl and pseBCH or pgIFED genes were co-expressed in BRLO4 as described. Analysis of clarified-cell lysates from production cultures of BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL151 with CE-MS in the negative-ion mode gave a distinct m/z peak at 630.9 (M-H) for UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (Figure 6A). This peak was absent in the negative control (Figure 6C). Similarly, the BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL152 strain was shown to produce UDP-BacdiNAc (Figure 6B; m/z of 630.9). These results confirmed that the engineered E. coil strains are able to synthesize and produce UDP-linked 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy hexoses. The strain for production of UDP-BacdiNAc, BRL04/pBRL178/pBRL152, was deposited with the International Depositary Authority of Canada (National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2) on April 7, 2011, under deposit number 060411-01. Example 6: Construction of an E. coli strain deficient in enterobacterial common antioen (ECM, colanic acid, and poly-N-acetyldlucosamine biosynthesis There are no known biosynthetic or catabolic enzymes in E. coil involved in the metabolism of 2-acetamido-6-deoxy sugars (Keseler et al, 2009). However, the UDP-GIcNAc undecaprenyl-phosphate transferase, WecA (SEQ ID NO:18), from E. coil K-12 has been shown to accept UDP-linked 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy hexoses (Linton et al, 2005). This evidence indicates that E. coil could salvage UDP-activated 2-acetamido-6-deoxy sugars by incorporating them into its own exo-polysaccharides; however, the substrate specificities of the glycosyltransferases in the majority of these pathways are poorly characterized. To prevent unwanted glycosylation reactions that could consume UDP-linked Pse intermediates, the genes necessary for the biosynthesis of colanic acid (Stevenson et al, 1996), enterobacterial common antigen (ECA;  Erbel et al, 2003), and poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PGA; Rohl et al, 2008), and wecA were deleted from E. coil K-12 to test the effect on Pse production. It is worth noting that WecA may have the same effect on a strain for the production of legionaminic acid.   Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 A wecA- E. coil K-12 strain was obtained from the Keio Collection; this strain, BW25113 (.6(araD-araB)567, A/acZ4787(::rrnB-3), lambda-, rph-1, 6.(rhaD-rhaB)568, hsdR514) (Table 6), has the wecA gene replaced with a kanamycin marker, and thus cannot biosynthesize ECA. A A.(DE3) lysogen, encoding a T7 RNA polymerase under the control of a lac promoter, was inserted into the chromosome of the wecA- E. coil K-12 strain, using the 1.(DE3) lysogenization kit from Novagen (San Diego, California), to generate the strain BRL11. Next, the entire colanic acid and poly-N-acetyglucosamine gene clusters were sequentially deleted from BRL11 using the lambda Red system. The plasmids pKD3, pCP20 and pKD46, were used for lambda Red recombination in E. coil (Lundgren, 2010). Primers used for the construction of the replacement, antibiotic-marker cassettes are given in Table 5. Table 5. Primers used for cassette construction. Primers (al, a2) and (bl , b2) were used to PCR-amplify gene regions targeted for chromosomal deletion; primers (cl , c2) were used to generate the chloramphenicol-marker. The homology arms from (al, a2) and (bl , b2) were fused with the marker from (cl , c2) to yield the full-length replacement cassette for lambda Red recombination. colanic         al -gttatcgatgatcaggttgcgc                         SEQ ID  NO:37 acid                                                               a2-gaagcagctccagcctacaccgccagcttgctgcaggctttatag SEQ ID NO:38 bl-ctaaggaggatattcattgtttatttatcactttggcag                         SEQ ID  NO:39 b2-gtaataacctcacattatccctg                                         SEQ ID  NO:40 cl- gtgtaggctggagctgcttc                                           SEQ ID  NO:41 c2- gtgtaggctggagctgcttc                                           SEQ ID  NO:42 pgaDABC al- atgtattcaagtagcagaaaaaggtg                             SEQ ID  NO:43 a2-                                                                SEQ ID  NO:44 gaagcagctccagcctacacggttattgctgagtgctgattttagtgc bl -ctaaggaggatattcatgtctgggcgctgtacaataagctgcg                    SEQ ID  NO:45 b2-ttatgcccggactagcgctttttctgaaac                                  SEQ ID  NO:46 cl- gtgtaggctggagctgcttc                                           SEQ ID  NO:47 c2- atgggaattagccatggtcc                                           SEQ ID  NO:48 Deletions were performed using standard molecular biology protocols. The colanic acid gene cluster region, wza-wcaM, was targeted first for deletion in the strain BRL11 and positive clones, were verified by kanamycin and chloramphenicol sensitivity. This markerless AwecA A wza-.. wcaM E. col/ strain was designated as BRL21.   Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 The poly-N-acetylglucosamine gene cluster, pgaABCD (Rice et al, 2008), was then deleted from BRL21 to generate strain BRL25. The pgaABCD region was replaced with a chloramphenicol marker. Expression of the PseBCHGI pathway in the biofilm deficient strain BRL25 did not yield any pseudaminic acid by proton NMR. The inability to detect Pse was attributed to a low conversion rate of UDP-GIcNAc into the desired pseudaminic acid product. Example 7: Leaionaminic acid production from E. coil Legionaminic acid is produced by co-expressing the pg1FED (pBRL152) and agmlluapl (pBRL178) genes with the genes LegG and Legl (see Table 1) in E. coil BRL04.  The LegG gene is derived from Legionella pneumophila (Glaze et al, 2008) (Lpg0753; SEQ ID  NO:11) and the Legl gene is derived from C. jejuni (Schoenhofen et al, 2009) (Cj1327; SEQ ID  NO:9) or L.  pneumophila (Glaze at al, 2008) (Lpg0752 ; SEQ ID NO:10). Starter cultures are grown in 1 mL of LB media, supplemented with the necessary antibiotics, at 37 C, 200 rpm, for 18 h. A 20 mL F2 minimal media (in 250-mL shake-flask), supplemented with the necessary antibiotics, 0.25% casitone and 1% (v/v) glycerol is inoculated with 0.2 mL of starter culture. Production cultures are grown at 37 C, 200 rpm, until an 013600 of 0.5 is reached.  Legionaminic acid production is induced with 0.2 mM IPTG (final concentration), and the incubation temperature is lowered to 30 C. Production cultures are grown for 72 h and supplemented with 0.6% (v/v) glycerol at 0, 12 and 36 h post induction. At 0, 18 and 36 h post induction, doses of 0.2% GIcNAc are added for legionaminic acid biosynthesis/production. Alternatively, pg1FED (pBRL152) is co-expressed with agm 1 uapl (pBRL178) as just described above. To produce legionaminic acid, the expression is done in the presence of a UDP-BacdiNAc hydrolyzing 2-epimerase and a Leg synthase (Schoenhofen et al, 2009;  Glaze et al, 2008). In yet another alternative, the UDP-BacdiNAc is recovered or partially recovered from the UDP-BacdiNAc culture of Example 5 and the UDP-BacdiNAc hydrolyzing 2-epimerase and Leg synthase enzymes are added to the recovered or partially recovered precursor. As shown in Figures 2 and 10, an epimerase hydrolyzes the glycosidic linkage of UDP-BacdiNAc and catalyzes an inversion of configuration at C2 to liberate 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-mannose. Unlike the pseudaminic acid DATDH-biosynthetic intermediate 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc, which has the glucose configuration at C2 (Figure 2), the Leg-DATDH precursor 6-deoxy-MandiNAc is unlikely to be catabolized by NagA/NagB. Instead, its degradation could proceed Date Recue/Date Received 2022-03-30 through N-acetylmannose metabolism consisting of the ManNAc-6-P epimerase, NanE (SEQ ID  NO:17) (Plumbridge & Vimr, 1999). NanE converts ManNAc-6-P into GIcNAc-6-P, and thus is required for catabolism of 2-acetamido mannose sugars in E. coll. Thus, a strain for production of legionaminic acid could also comprise an inactivated ManNAc-6-P epimerase gene. Detection of Leg from production cultures may be done using a method similar to that described in Example 4. Example 8: Summary of plasmic's and E. coil strains The bacterial strains and plasmids used and prepared herein are described in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. Table 6. E. coil strains used given with relevant genotypes. The BRLO2 and BRLO4 strains are derived from E. coil K-12 MG1655 (Kang et al, 2004). The BRL11, BRL21 and BRL25 strains are derived from E. coil BW25113. Resistance of strains to antibiotics kanamycin (Km), tetracycline (Tc) and/or chloramphenicol (Cm) is indicated.
