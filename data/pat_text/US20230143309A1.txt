     The present invention relates to conjugates comprising a specific pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD), and the precursor drug linker used to make such conjugates. 
   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION 
   
    
    [0002]
     Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al.,  Chem. Rev.  1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al.,  Chem. Brit.,  26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al.,  Tetrahedron,  48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al,  J. Antibiotics,  29, 2492-2503 (1982);  Langley and Thurston, J. Org. Chem.,  52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0003]
     They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N═C), a carbinolamine (NH—CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH—CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In  Antibiotics III . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter,  Acc. Chem. Res.,  19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents. 
     
    
    [0004]
     It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of this molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8/C′-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al.,  J. Org. Chem.,  61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5′-Pu-GATC-Py-3′ interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al.,  Biochemistry,  42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al.,  Biochemistry,  44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity. 
     
    
    [0005]
     One example of a PBD dimer is SG2000 (SJG-136): 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0006]
     (Gregson, S., et al.,  J. Med. Chem.,  44, 737-748 (2001); Alley, M. C., et al.,  Cancer Research,  64, 6700-6706 (2004); Hartley, J. A., et al.,  Cancer Research,  64, 6693-6699 (2004)) which has been involved in clinical trials as a standalone agent, for example, NCT02034227 investigating its use in treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (see: clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02034227). 
     
    
    [0007]
     Dimeric PBD compounds bearing C2 aryl substituents, such as SG2202 (ZC-207), are disclosed in WO 2005/085251: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     and in WO2006/111759, bisulphites of such PBD compounds, for example SG2285 (ZC-423): 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0008]
     These compounds have been shown to be highly useful cytotoxic agents (Howard, P. W., et al.,  Bioorg. Med. Chem . (2009), doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.09.012). 
     
    
    [0009]
     In an impact study submitted to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the United Kingdom by University College London (available at impact.ref.ac.uk/casestudies2/refservice.svc/GetCaseStudyPDF/35393), it was commented that: 
     
    
    [0010]
     “The next generation of PBD dimers, which are more potent than SG2000, have been developed, including SG2057 and SG2202. They exhibit picomolar/sub-picomolar activity against a range of human tumour cell lines and demonstrate curative activity in human tumour xenograft models.” making reference to:

    [0012]
     “The ability to generate such cytotoxic molecules that display exquisite potency suggested a potential role in strategies aimed at targeting and releasing highly cytotoxic agents directly at a tumour site. An example is as the ‘warhead’ component of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The fully synthetic PBD dimers are ideally suited for the role of warhead in an ADC approach.” 
     
    
    [0013]
     The Hartley et al (2012) paper comments in its summary that “SG2057 is therefore a highly active antiumour agent, with more potent in vitro activity and superior in vivo activity to SG2000, warranting further development”. 
     
    
    [0014]
     SG2057 has the structure: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0015]
     Antibody drug conjugates using SG2057 as a warhead were first disclosed in WO 2011/130598. For example,  claim   54  of this application includes the formula: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0016]
     wherein n is from 1 to 24, more preferably 4 to 8. The following drug linkers were exemplified: n=4, 15c; n=8, 15d; n=24, 15e. 
     
    
    [0017]
       Claim  54 of this application also includes the formula: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0018]
     wherein n is from 1 to 24, more preferably 4 to 8. The following drug linkers were exemplified: n=8, 58; n=24, 61. 
     
    
    [0019]
     WO 2011/130598 also discloses antibody-drug conjugates including these drug linkers, for example 110 (antiSteap1-15d), example 114 (tastuzumab-15d) and example 115 (tastuzumab-58).

   DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 
   
    
    [0025]
     The present inventors have surprisingly found that although SG2000 is at least 10 times less cytotoxic than SG2057 (see Hartley et al 2012), particular antibody-drug conjugates appear to show at least comparable activity. These conjugates have been shown to have surprisingly well tolerated in toxicity studies in a variety of species. This leads to the conjugates exhibiting high therapeutic indices and thus are promising clinical candidates. 
     
    
    [0026]
     In a first aspect, the present invention provides Conjugates of formula I: 
       L-(D L ) p   (I)
 
     
    
    [0027]
     wherein L is a Ligand unit (i.e., a targeting agent), D L  is a Drug Linker unit of formula II: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0028]
     wherein 
     
    
    [0029]
     either: 
     
    
    [0030]
     (a) R 10  and R 11  form a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound; or 
     
    
    [0031]
     (b) R 11  is OH, and R 10  is: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0032]
     p is an integer of from 1 to 20. 
     
    
    [0033]
     The Ligand unit, described more fully below, is a targeting agent that binds to a target moiety. The Ligand unit can, for example, specifically bind to a cell component (a Cell Binding Agent) or to other target molecules of interest. The Ligand unit can be, for example, a protein, polypeptide or peptide, such as an antibody, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, or other binding agent, such as an Fc fusion protein. 
     
    
    [0034]
     A second aspect of the present invention provides a compound of formula III: 
     
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
     
    
    [0035]
     wherein 
     
    
    [0036]
     either: 
     
    
    [0037]
     (a) R 10  and R 11  form a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound; or

    [0039]
     A third aspect of the present invention provides the use of a conjugate of the first aspect of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a proliferative disease. The third aspect also provides a conjugate of the first aspect of the invention for use in the treatment of a proliferative disease. The third aspect also provides a method of treating a proliferative disease comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate of the first aspect of the invention to a patient in need thereof. 
     
    
    [0040]
     One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether or not a candidate conjugate treats a proliferative condition for any particular cell type. For example, assays which may conveniently be used to assess the activity offered by a particular compound are described in the examples below.

     Ligand Unit 
     
    
    [0050]
     The Ligand Unit may be of any kind, and include a protein, polypeptide, peptide and a non-peptidic agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a cyclic polypeptide. These Ligand units can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one target molecule-binding site, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, or any other cell binding molecule or substance that can specifically bind to a target. 
     
    
    [0051]
     The terms “specifically binds” and “specific binding” refer to the binding of an antibody or other protein, polypeptide or peptide to a predetermined molecule (e.g., an antigen). Typically, the antibody or other molecule binds with an affinity of at least about 1×10 7  M −1 , and binds to the predetermined molecule with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific molecule (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined molecule or a closely-related molecule. 
     
    
    [0052]
     Examples of Ligand units include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein. 
     
    
    [0053]
     In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a Cell Binding Agent that binds to an extracellular target on a cell. Such a Cell Binding Agent can be a protein, polypeptide, peptide or a non-peptidic agent. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a cyclic polypeptide. The Cell Binding Agent also may be antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). 
     
    
    [0054]
     Cell Binding Agent 
     
    
    [0055]
     A cell binding agent may be of any kind, and include peptides and non-peptides. These can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one binding site, lymphokines, hormones, hormone mimetics, vitamins, growth factors, nutrient-transport molecules, or any other cell binding molecule or substance. 
     
    
    [0056]
     Peptides 
     
    
    [0057]
     In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4-30, preferably 6-20, contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment, it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound. 
     
    
    [0058]
     In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin α v β 6 . The peptide may be selective for α v β 6  over XYS. 
     
    
    [0059]
     In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV-Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV-Cys has the sequence: NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC. Alternatively, a variant of the A20FMDV-Cys sequence may be used wherein one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten amino acid residues are substituted with another amino acid residue. Furthermore, the polypeptide may have the sequence NAVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXRTC. 
     
    
    [0060]
     Antibodies 
     
    
    [0061]
     The term “antibody” herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003)  Jour. of Immunology  170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001)  Immuno Biology,  5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin. 
     
    
    [0062]
     “Antibody fragments” comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′) 2 , and scFv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. 
     
    
    [0063]
     The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975)  Nature  256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991)  Nature,  352:624-628; Marks et al (1991)  J. Mol. Biol.,  222:581-597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system (Lonberg (2008)  Curr. Opinion  20(4):450-459). 
     
    
    [0064]
     The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984)  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include “primatized” antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences. 
     
    
    [0065]
     An “intact antibody” herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more “effector functions” which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR. 
     
    
    [0066]
     Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different “classes.” There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into “subclasses” (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called a, 5, E, y, and p, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. 
     
    
    [0067]
     Humanisation 
     
    
    [0068]
     Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non-human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed “humanisation”. 
     
    
    [0069]
     A “humanized antibody” refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region, preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain, has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein, preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression “humanized antibodies” includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region (“CDR”)amino acid residues and/or one or more framework region (“FW” or “FR”)amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non-human antibodies. The expression “humanized antibody” also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin. 
     
    
    [0070]
     “Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Or, looked at another way, a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non-natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and/or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulins. 
     
    
    [0071]
     There are a range of humanisation techniques, including ‘CDR grafting’, ‘guided selection’, ‘deimmunization’, ‘resurfacing’ (also known as ‘veneering’), ‘composite antibodies’, ‘Human String Content Optimisation’ and framework shuffling. 
     
    
    [0072]
     CDR Grafting

     In this technique, the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, camel, bovine, goat, or rabbit having the desired properties (in effect, the non-human CDRs are ‘grafted’ onto the human framework). In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues (this may happen when, for example, a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding). 
     
    
    [0074]
     Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus, in general, a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one, and in one aspect two, variable domains, in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), or that of a human immunoglobulin.

     Guided Selection 
     
    
    [0076]
     The method consists of combining the V H  or V L  domain of a given non-human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human V H  or V L  library and specific human V domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VHxVL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology (N.Y.) 12, (1994) 899-903. 
     
    
    [0077]
     Composite Antibodies 
     
    
    [0078]
     In this method, two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required, T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by, exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008/0206239 A1. 
     
    
    [0079]
     Deimmunization 
     
    
    [0080]
     This method involves the removal of human (or other second species) T-cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody (or other molecule). The therapeutic antibodies V-region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II-binding motifs by, for example, comparison with databases of MHC-binding motifs (such as the “motifs” database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au). Alternatively, MHC class II-binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. ( J. Mol. Biol.  249 244-250 (1995)); in these methods, consecutive overlapping peptides from the V-region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides, such as amphipathicity, Rothbard motifs, and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes. 
     
    
    [0081]
     Once potential second species (e.g. human) T-cell epitopes have been identified, they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T-cell epitope itself, but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein (and therefore, may not be adjacent in the primary structure). Most typically, the alteration is by way of substitution but, in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate. 
     
    
    [0082]
     All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology, so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However, the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible.

     Resurfacing 
     
    
    [0084]
     This method involves: 
     
    
    [0085]
     (a) determining the conformational structure of the variable region of the non-human (e.g. rodent) antibody (or fragment thereof) by constructing a three-dimensional model of the non-human antibody variable region; 
     
    
    [0086]
     (b) generating sequence alignments using relative accessibility distributions from x-ray crystallographic structures of a sufficient number of non-human and human antibody variable region heavy and light chains to give a set of heavy and light chain framework positions wherein the alignment positions are identical in 98% of the sufficient number of non-human antibody heavy and light chains; 
     
    
    [0087]
     (c) defining for the non-human antibody to be humanized, a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues using the set of framework positions generated in step (b); 
     
    
    [0088]
     (d) identifying from human antibody amino acid sequences a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues that is most closely identical to the set of surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c), wherein the heavy and light chain from the human antibody are or are not naturally paired; 
     
    
    [0089]
     (e) substituting, in the amino acid sequence of the non-human antibody to be humanized, the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c) with the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues identified in step (d); 
     
    
    [0090]
     (f) constructing a three-dimensional model of the variable region of the non-human antibody resulting from the substituting specified in step (e); 
     
    
    [0091]
     (g) identifying, by comparing the three-dimensional models constructed in steps (a) and (f), any amino acid residues from the sets identified in steps (c) or (d), that are within 5 Angstroms of any atom of any residue of the complementarity determining regions of the non-human antibody to be humanized; and 
     
    
    [0092]
     (h) changing any residues identified in step (g) from the human to the original non-human amino acid residue to thereby define a non-human antibody humanizing set of surface exposed amino acid residues; with the proviso that step (a) need not be conducted first, but must be conducted prior to step (g). 
     
    
    [0093]
     Superhumanization 
     
    
    [0094]
     The method compares the non-human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non-human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally, the non-human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005/079479 A2. 
     
    
    [0095]
     Human String Content Optimization 
     
    
    [0096]
     This method compares the non-human (e.g. mouse) sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content (HSC) that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC/T-cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants (described in Molecular Immunology, 44, (2007) 1986-1998). 
     
    
    [0097]
     Framework Shuffling 
     
    
    [0098]
     The CDRs of the non-human antibody are fused in-frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in  Methods  36, 43-60 (2005).

     The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) sequence (Dennis et al. (2002) “Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins”  J Biol Chem.  277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746). Antibodies of the invention include fusion proteins with ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002)  J Biol Chem.  277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; (ii) US 2004/0001827 at [0076]; and (iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, and all of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
     
    
    [1414]
     In one embodiment, the antibody has been raised to target specific the tumour related antigen α v β 6 . 
     
    
    [1415]
     The cell binding agent may be labelled, for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate, or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope. 
     
    
    [1416]
     Connection of Linker Unit to Ligand Unit 
     
    
    [1417]
     The Ligand unit is connected to the Linker unit through a disulfide bond. 
     
    
    [1418]
     In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Drug Linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the Ligand unit and a maleimide group of the Drug Linker unit. 
     
    
    [1419]
     The cysteine residues of the Ligand unit may be available for reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit to form a connection. In other embodiments, for example where the Ligand unit is an antibody, the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit. 
     
    
    [1420]
     In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is an introduced into the heavy or light chain of an antibody. Positions for cysteine insertion by substitution in antibody heavy or light chains include those described in Published U.S. Application No. 2007-0092940 and International Patent Publication WO2008070593, which are incorporated herein. 
     
    
    [1421]
     Methods of Treatment 
     
    
    [1422]
     The compounds of the present invention may be used in a method of therapy. Also provided is a method of treatment, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a conjugate of formula I. The term “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors. 
     
    
    [1423]
     A conjugate may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g. drugs; surgery; and radiation therapy. 
     
    
    [1424]
     Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, i.e. a conjugate of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous. 
     
    
    [1425]
     Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included. A capsule may comprise a solid carrier such a gelatin. 
     
    
    [1426]
     For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included, as required. 
     
    
    [1427]
     The Conjugates can be used to treat proliferative disease and autoimmune disease. The term “proliferative disease” pertains to an unwanted or uncontrolled cellular proliferation of excessive or abnormal cells which is undesired, such as, neoplastic or hyperplastic growth, whether in vitro or in vivo. 
     
    
    [1428]
     Examples of proliferative conditions include, but are not limited to, benign, pre-malignant, and malignant cellular proliferation, including but not limited to, neoplasms and tumours (e.g., histocytoma, glioma, astrocyoma, osteoma), cancers (e.g. lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, bowel cancer, colon cancer, breast carinoma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, melanoma), leukemias, psoriasis, bone diseases, fibroproliferative disorders (e.g. of connective tissues), and atherosclerosis. Other cancers of interest include, but are not limited to, haematological; malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and subtypes such as DLBCL, marginal zone, mantle zone, and follicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, AML, and other cancers of B or T cell origin.

    [1432]
     Drug Loading 
     
    
    [1433]
     The drug loading (p) is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent, e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines, drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines, drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, although an upper limit of 40, 20, 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 80, 1 to 40, 1 to 20, 1 to 10 or 1 to 8. 
     
    
    [1434]
     The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV, reverse phase HPLC, HIC, mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004)  Clin. Cancer Res.  10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005)  Clin. Cancer Res.  11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates. 
     
    
    [1435]
     For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. 
     
    
    [1436]
     Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the Drug Linker (A or B). Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of Drug Linker (A or B) relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification. 
     
    
    [1437]
     Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by engineering one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids. 
     
    
    [1438]
     Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) Blood 114(13):2721-2729; U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,521,541; 7,723,485; WO2009/052249). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC. 
     
    
    [1439]
     Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody. 
     
    
    [1440]
     Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues. 
     
    
    [1441]
     In one embodiment, the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the  range  1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8, 2 to 8, 2 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8. 
     
    
    [1442]
     In some embodiments, there is one dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine group per cell binding agent.

     Conjugates can be prepared as previously described. Antibodies can be conjugated to the Drug Linker compounds (A or B) as described in Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2003, 21, 778-784). Briefly, antibodies (4-5 mg/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37° C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, is monitored by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols/mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0° C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol. After 1 hour, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC is then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation, and RP-HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker.

     A 50 mM solution of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) was added (50 molar equivalent/antibody, 20 micromoles, 0.4 mL) to a 13.25 mL solution of antibody (60 mg, 0.4 micromoles) in reduction buffer containing PBS and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at a final antibody concentration of 4.5 mg/mL. The reduction mixture was heated at +37° C. for 3 hours (or until full reduction is observed by UHPLC) in an incubator with gentle (<150 rpm) shaking. After cooling down to room temperature, the reduced antibody was buffer exchanged, via spin filter centrifugation, into a reoxidation buffer containing PBS and 1 mM EDTA to remove excess reducing agent. A 50 mM solution of dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA, 12 molar equivalent/antibody, 4.8 micromoles, 96 μL) in DMSO was added and the reoxidation mixture was allowed to react for 17 hours at room temperature (or until full reoxidation of the cysteine thiols to reform the inter-chain cysteine disulfides is observed by UHPLC) with gentle (<150 rpm) shaking at an antibody concentration of ˜1.6 mg/mL. The reoxidation mixture was then sterile-filtered and diluted in a conjugation buffer containing PBS and 1 mM EDTA to a final antibody concentration of ˜1.5 mg/mL.  Compound  40 was added as a DMSO solution (11 molar equivalent/antibody, 0.44 micromoles, in 0.45 mL DMSO) to 4.05 mL of this reoxidised antibody solution (6 mg, 40 nanomoles). The solution was mixed for 1.25 hours at room temperature, after which the conjugation reaction was quenched by addition of N-acetyl cysteine (1.76 micromoles, 17.6 μL at 100 mM). The conjugation mixture was purified by spin filtration with PBS using a 15 mL Amicon Ultracell 50 kDa MWCO spin filter, sterile-filtered, analysed and stored at +4° C.

    [1531]
     A 50 mM solution of DTT (Dithiothreitol) in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) was added (40 molar equivalent/antibody, 40 micromoles, 825 μL) to a 37.5 mL solution of antibody HLL2 (150 mg, 1 micromol) in reduction buffer containing PBS and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and a final antibody concentration of 4 mg/mL. The reduction mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight with gentle (135 rpm) shaking. The reduced antibody was buffer-exchanged against PBS+1 mM EDTA (to remove the excess of DTT) using TFF (Tangential Flow Filtration, Spectrum Labs 115 cm 2  hollow fibre cassette with 50 kDa molecular weight cut off). The sample was filtered using a 0.4 μm syringe filter to remove any debris from the TFF step and antibody concentration brought to 1.5 mg/mL before reoxidation. A 50 mM solution of dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA, 15 molar equivalent/antibody, 13.9 micromoles, 0.28 mL) in DMSO was added and the reoxidation mixture was allowed to react for 16 hours at room temperature under gentle (<150 rpm) shaking. The reoxidation mixture was then sterile-filtered; 139 mg of antibody (92.6 mL as 1.5 mg/mL solution) was obtained, 14 mL of which was taken forward for conjugation with Compound 23 (estimated ca. 21 mg antibody, 0.14 micromoles).  Compound  23 was added as a DMSO solution (10 molar equivalent/antibody, 0.33 micromoles in 0.133 mL DMSO) to 14 mL of the reoxidised antibody solution. The conjugation mixture was topped with 1.27 ml of DMSO to bring the final DMSO concentration to 10% (v/v) and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature under gentle agitation (135 rpm). Free drug was then removed from the antibody-drug conjugate by extensive diafiltration in PBS using a spin filter device (Amicon Ultra-30K centrifugal filter, Millipore). The resulting conjugation mixture was sterile-filtered and analysed by UHPLC.

   Example 5—In Vitro Testing 
   
    
    [1538]
     Medium from sub-confluent (80-90% confluency) cell culture in a T75 flask was aspirated and the flask rinsed with PBS (about 20 ml) and emptied. Trypsin-EDTA (5 ml) was added, the flask returned to the 37° C. gassed incubator for up to about 5 minutes, then rapped sharply to dislodge and dissociate cells from the plastic. The cell suspension was transferred to a sterile 50 ml screw-top centrifuge tube, diluted with growth medium to a final volume of 15 ml, then centrifuged (400 g for 5 min). The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml culture medium. Repeated pipetting may be necessary to produce monodisperse cell suspensions. The cell concentration and viability are measured of trypan blue cell stained cells, using a haemocytometer. Cells were diluted to 2×10 5 /ml, dispensed (50 μl/well) into 96 well flat bottom plates and incubated overnight before use. 
     
    
    [1539]
     A stock solution (1 ml) of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) (20pg/ml) was made by dilution of filter-sterilised ADC into cell culture medium. A set of 8x 10-fold dilutions of stock ADC were made in a 24 well plate by serial transfer of 100 μl onto 900 μl of cell culture medium. 
     
    
    [1540]
     ADC dilution was dispensed (50 μl/well) into 4 replicate wells of the 96-well plate, containing 50 μl cell suspension seeded the previous day. Control wells received 50 μl cell culture medium. 
     
    
    [1541]
     The 96-well plate containing cells and ADCs was incubated at 37° C. in a CO 2 -gassed incubator for the exposure time. 
     
    
    [1542]
     At the end of the incubation period, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. MTS (Promega) was dispensed (20 μl per well) into each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37° C. in the CO 2 -gassed incubator. Well absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Percentage cell survival was calculated from the mean absorbance in the 4 ADC-treated wells compared to the mean absorbance in the 4 control untreated wells (100%). IC 50  was determined from the doses-response data using GraphPad Prism using the non-linear curve fit algorithm: sigmoidal, 4PL X is log(concentration).

     In Vivo Implantation and Tumour Growth 
     
    
    [1551]
     Xenografts were initiated with BT474 human breast carcinomas maintained at CR Discovery Services by serial subcutaneous transplantation into the SCID mice (see above). On the day of tumour implant, each test mouse received a 1-mm 3  BT474 fragment implanted subcutaneously in the right flank, and tumour growth was monitored as the average size approached the target range of 100 to 150 mm 3 . Thirty-three days after tumour implantation, designated as  Day  1 of the study, the animals were sorted into nine groups each consisting of ten mice with individual tumour volumes of 75 to 144 mm 3  and group mean tumour volumes of 111 to 112 mm 3 . Tumours were measured in two dimensions using calipers, and volume was calculated using the formula: 
       Tumour Volume (mm 3 )=0.5( w   2   ×l ) 
     
    
    [1552]
     where w=width and l=length, in mm, of the tumour. Tumour weight may be estimated with the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm 3  of tumour volume. 
     
    
    [1553]
       Treatment  1 
     
    
    [1554]
     Treatment began on  Day  1 in groups of mice (n=10) with established subcutaneous BT474 tumors (75-196 mm 3 ). Trastuzumab-23 was administered intravenously once on Day 1 (qd×1) at two dosages (0.3 and 1 mg/kg). A vehicle-treated group served as the control group for efficacy analysis. Tumors were measured twice per week until the study was ended on  Day  60. Each mouse was euthanized when its tumor reached the endpoint volume of 800 mm 3  or on the final day, whichever came first. The time to endpoint (TTE) was calculated for each mouse. 
     
    
    [1555]
     Treatment outcome was determined from percent tumor growth delay (% TGD), defined as the percent increase in median TTE for treated versus control mice, with differences between groups deemed statistically significant at P s 0.05 using logrank survival analysis. Mice were monitored for complete regression (CR) and partial regression (PR) responses.

     Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. All regimens were acceptably tolerated. 
     
    
    [1557]
     The median TTE for vehicle-treated controls was 44.4 days, establishing a maximum possible TGD of 15.6 days (35%) for the 60-day study. ADC regimens resulted in the maximum possible TGD, produced survival benefit that was statistically significantly different from vehicle-treated controls (P<0.01) and could not be distinguished based on logrank analysis (P>0.05). Differences within ADC treatments were only evident in the MTV on the final day and numbers and types of regression responses produced by each regimen. 
     
    
    [1558]
     Trastuzumab-23 at 1 mg/kg produced four partial regressions (PRs). The results are illustrated in  FIG.  1   .

Trastuzumab-40 was administered intravenously once on Day 1 (qd×1) at two dosages (0.3 and 1 mg/kg). A vehicle-treated group served as the control group for efficacy analysis. Tumors were measured twice per week until the study was ended on Day 83. Each mouse was euthanized when its tumor reached the endpoint volume of 800 mm 3  or on the final day, whichever came first. The time to endpoint (TTE) was calculated for each mouse. 
     
    
    [1577]
     Treatment outcome was determined from percent tumor growth delay (% TGD), defined as the percent increase in median TTE for treated versus control mice, with differences between groups deemed statistically significant at P s 0.05 using logrank survival analysis. Mice were monitored for complete regression (CR) and partial regression (PR) responses. Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. All regimens were acceptably tolerated. 
     
    
    [1578]
     The median TTE for vehicle-treated controls was 44.9 days, establishing a maximum possible TGD of 38.1 days (85%) for the 83-day study. Trastuzumab-40 (0.3 mg/kg) had a median TTE of 54.2 days corresponding to a TGD of 9.3 days (21%). Trastuzumab-40 (1 mg/kg) had a median TTE of 61.6 days corresponding to a TGD of 16.7 days (37%).

     Rat Study: 
     
    
    [1581]
     A single dose toxicity study was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of Trastuzumab-23. Male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Inc) were dosed once by slow bolus intravenous injection via the tail vein with vehicle control (25 mM Histidine-HCl, 7% sucrose, 0.02 % Polysorbate  80, pH 6.0) or test material (Trastuzumab-23). Parameters evaluated during the study included mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, body weights, body weight changes, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulation), and gross pathology findings. All animals were terminated on Study Day (SD) 29.

    [1582]
     Tolerability was determined based on toxicity end points, including body weight loss (>10%) and bone marrow suppression. Based on minimal adverse findings at the high dose, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the rat after a single dose of Trastuzumab-23 was determined to be >7 mg/kg, which was the highest dose level evaluated. 
     
    
    [1583]
     Therapeutic Index 
     
    
    [1584]
     The Therapeutic Index can be calculated by dividing the maximum tolerated single dose (MTD) of non-targeted ADC in rat, by the minimal effective single dose (MED) of the a targeted ADC. The MED is the single dose necessary to achieve tumour stasis in an in vivo model at 28 days (for NCI-N87 xenograft). 
     
    
    [1585]
     Thus for conjugates of  compound  23, the therapeutic index is the MTD of greater than 7 mg/kg divided by the MED which is less than 1 mg/kg (see  FIG.  3    at 28 days), giving a Therapeutic Index of greater than 7.

     Cynomolgus Macaque Study: 
     
    
    [1587]
     A Single-Dose Toxicity study was performed in male Cynomolgus macaques monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) of Cambodian origin following a single intravenous (IV) bolus injection of ADC-SG3400. The study was conducted in 2 phases. In  phase  1, animals (n=1) were treated at dose levels of 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg to determine the optimal dose level to explore in phase 2. Animals were dosed by slow bolus intravenous injection via the saphenous vein with vehicle control (25 mM Histidine, 200 mM Sucrose, pH 6.0) or test material (Trastuzumab-23). Based on observations of significant body weight loss at 6 mg/kg, a dose level of 4.5 mg/kg was chosen for phase 2 of the study. In phase 2, animals (n=3) were administered a single dose of 4.5 mg/kg Trastuzumab-23 on  Day  1 and necropsied on  Days  71 or 72.

     Tolerability was determined based on toxicity end points, including body weight loss (>10%) and bone marrow suppression. There was no unscheduled mortality in any animal administered Trastuzumab-23. The major findings were body weight loss and bone marrow suppression at the highest tested dose of 6 mg/kg. Based on these data, and minimal signs of toxicity at next lowest dose, the MTD of Trastuzumab-23 in cynos was 4.5 mg/kg.
