 Technical field 
 New expected with providing in processing milk powder the present invention relates to method, enzyme treated milk powder and the enzyme of production milk powder
Less than technical advantage in purposes. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Milk powder is (herein also referred to as " milk powder ") by breast being dried obtained artificial milk product.Dry main purpose
It is to extend its shelf life and avoid the need for refrigerating, because moisture is low.Milk powder and powder dairy products may include whole-fat milk powder, take off
Fat milk powder, buttermilk powder, dry whey product and mammala mixture. 
 Generally, milk powder is by made from being spray-dried skimmed milk, rich milk, buttermilk or whey.General bar first
Family name's sterile milk is concentrated into about 50% milk solid in evaporator.The concentrated milk of gained is sprayed in heating chamber, moisture exists
Wherein almost flash evapn, leaves milk solid powder particle.Powder particle is separated from air stream, reclaimed in drying
Device bottom, while humid air is discharged evaporator. 
 Or breast can be also dried by drum dried method (also referred to as roller drying).Breast is set to be applied to heating with film
The surface of rotary drum (generally being heated by steam).The water of the water of evaporation is drained, leaves dry milk solid, it is on rotary drum
Thin layer is formed, then scrapes the thin layer.Obtained milk powder often has kind of " cooked " taste by this way, and this is due to excessively sudden and violent
Be exposed to heat and caused by caused by caramelization. 
 The method that another kind is used for producing milk powder is freeze-drying, and it can retain many battalion in breast compared with drum dried
Support thing.But the expense of this method is generally higher than drum dried or spray drying. 
 Milk powder product and preparation method thereof is in " Milk and Dairy Products ", R.Jost, publ. Wiley-
There is the description of summary in VCH, Weinheim, 2007, the document has been incorporated by reference herein. 
 WO 2006/066590 describes the method using phosphatidase particularly phospholipase A production milk powder.But this is literary
Offer the pollution for not disclosing or prompting to equipment used in this method can be prevented using this enzyme production milk powder. 
 Known acyltransferase is favourable in food applications.It has been found that acyltransferase has in food
There is significant acyltransferase activity.This activity has unexpected advantageous application in the method for making food. 
 For example, WO 2004/064537 discloses the method and correlation using acyltransferase produced in situ emulsifying agent
The advantages of. 
 WO 2008/090395 describes expresses acyltransferase in (heterologous) host cell, and the patent is to quote
Mode is incorporated herein. 
 WO 2009/024862 is described using made from the method and this method of acyltransferase manufacture UHT breasts
Breast. 
 The key component of breast is water, fat, protein, lactose and mineral matter (salt).Breast also contains other a small amount of materials,
Such as pigment, enzyme, vitamin, phosphatide (material with the adipose property of class), sterol and gas. 
 Many lipids of breast are collectively forming " butter oil ", and it has extremely complex the Nomenclature Composition and Structure of Complexes, than it is most of other
Natural fat will also complexity.Generally, butter oil is by triglycerides, diglyceride and monoglyceride, aliphatic acid, sterol, carotenoids
Element and vitamin (A, D, E and K) composition.Other compositions include phosphatide, lipoprotein, glycerine, cerebroside, protein, nucleic acid, enzyme,
Metal and water. 
 Phosphatide is surface-active highest one kind material, because they are ambipolar.Because molecular dimension is relatively large,
They tend to form sheet bilayer.Generally it can be seen that the phosphatide of breast is combined closely with protein, particularly when it is located at butter oil
When in the film of bead.The key component of phosphatide in breast includes lecithin, and it has medium hydrophilic surface-active.Therefore,
Lecithin can be considered suspending agent and dispersant or be considered as the emulsifying agent of O/W emulsions and W/O emulsions. 
 Phosphatide accounts for the 0.8-1.0% of genuine milk fat.The primary categories of phosphatide/lecithin in breast be phosphatidyl choline and
Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. 
 Sterol is highly insoluble in water, and shows extremely low surface-active.They easily associate with phosphatide.From the nutrition of breast
Value considers that cholesterine is regarded as the unwanted composition in breast.Cholesterol accounts for the 0.3-0.4% of genuine milk fat.

Row identical avtive spot etc..Although homology can also according to similitude (i.e. amino acid residue have it is similar chemically
Matter/function) consider, but in the linguistic context of this specification homology is preferably represented according to sequence identity. 
 In the linguistic context of this specification, homologous sequence means：Including such nucleotide sequence, it can be with the coding present invention
The nucleotide sequence (subject nucleotide sequence) of polypeptide has the homogeneity of the homogeneity of at least 75,85 or 90%, preferably at least 95 or 98%.It is logical
Often, homologue will include the sequence with subject nucleotide sequence identical encoding active site etc..Although homology can be according to similitude
(i.e. amino acid residue has similar chemical property/function) considers, but same preferably according to sequence in the linguistic context of the present invention
One property represents homology. 
 Tetraploid rice can be carried out by eye, or more generally, be entered by means of the sequence comparison program being readily available
OK.These commercially available computer programs can calculate the percent identity (%) between two or more sequences. 
 Percent identity (%) can calculate in continuous sequence, i.e., compared a sequence and another sequence
It is right, and by each amino acid amino acid corresponding with another sequence in a sequence directly compared with, residue one at a time.
This is referred to as " not producing room " and compared.Generally, it is this do not produce room comparison it is only enterprising in the residue of relatively short number
OK. 
 Although this is very simple and reliable method, it can not consider, for example, in script identical a pair of sequences
In, an insertion or missing will cause amino acid residue below no longer to align, so as to be led when carrying out overall comparison
% homologys are caused to have big reduction.Therefore, most Number Sequence comparative approach is designed to produce optimal comparison, and the optimal comparison is examined
Possible insertion and missing are considered without penalizing excessive overall homology score.This in sequence alignment by inserting " room "
To attempt to make local homology to maximize to realize. 
 Cause however, these more complicated methods are assigned to " gap penalty " to each room occurred in comparing for same
For the same amino acid of sample number, there is the sequence alignment for lacking room as far as possible (to reflect correlation between two comparative sequences
It is higher) fraction higher than the sequence alignment with many rooms will be obtained.Usually using " affine room cost (Affine
Gap costs) ", of a relatively high cost is imposed in its presence to room, and the residue follow-up to each in room is imposed less
Point penalty.This is most generally used gap scoring system.High gap penalty can will be produced with less room most certainly
Good comparison.Most of alignment programs allow to change gap penalty.However, when with this software preferably use when sequence compares
Default value. 
 The calculating of maximum % homologys thus produces optimal comparison firstly the need of in the case where considering gap penalty.Carry out
The suitable computer program of this comparison is Vector NTI (Invitrogen Corp.).Other can carry out the soft of sequence comparison
The example of part includes but is not limited to BLAST software kits (referring to Ausubel et al. 1999Short Protocols in
Molecular Biology, the 4th edition the 18th chapter) and FASTA (Altschul et al. 1990J.Mol.Biol.403-410).

FEMS Microbiol Lett 1999177(1)：187-8 and tatiana@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov )。 
 Although final percent identity (%) can also homogeneity measure, comparison process is not usually base in itself
In either it is complete have otherwise completely without paired comparison.On the contrary, usually using upscaled similarity score matrix, the matrix is based on chemistry
Similitude or evolutionary distance are relatively assigned to score value in pairs to each.The example of usually used this matrix is BLOSUM62 squares
The default matrix of battle array-blast program bag.Vector NTI programs are usually using public default values or the symbol comparison sheet of customization
(if provided that) (refers to user's manual) for further details.For some applications, it is preferred to use
Each default value of Vector NTI software kits. 
 Or it can be based on and CLUSTAL (Higgins DG＆Sharp PM (1988), Gene 73 (1), 237-244) class
As algorithm, using the Multiple Sequence Alignment feature in Vector NTI (Invitrogen Corp.), to calculate homology percentage
Number. 
 Once the software generates optimal comparison, it is likely that calculates percent identity (%), preferably % sequences are same
Property.The software generally makes the part that this point compares as sequence, and produces numerical result. 
 Gap penalty (Gap Penalties) should be used when determining sequence identity, then will preferably be joined as follows

 Conclusion 
 
 Ferment treatment is carried out to rich milk with acyltransferase KLM3, the wetability of the milk powder to being produced by the breast has
Significant impact.Ferment treatment also has an impact to drying temperature, because the moisture for having proven to enzyme treated sample compares control sample
Product are low. 
 Compared with not doing the control sample of ferment treatment, the free courage in the breast produced from the breast handled with acyltransferase
Sterol significantly reduces.
