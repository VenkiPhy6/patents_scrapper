Background Art  
 [2]    Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are one of the components of the outer membrane which surrounds peptidoglycan in Gram-negative bacteria. LPS are molecules containing lipid A and a variety of polysaccharides conjugated with the lipid A by a covalent bond. Among the components of LPS, Lipid A, which is also known as endotoxin, is held responsible for the toxicity of Gram-negative bacteria.  
 [3]    Lipid A is a very potent stimulant of the immune system, activating cells (for example, monocytes or macrophages) at picogram per milliliter quantities.  Derivatives of lipid A or variants of lipid A can be used as, for example, components of vaccines such as adjuvants. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) is used as an adjuvant and used for allergen-specific immunotherapy and immunotherapy for cancer, and has also been reported to be effective in the prevention and treatment of dementia. Lipid A  found in the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, conjugates with sugars such as 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Kdo). Accordingly, MLA may be produced by extracting LPS from the outer membrane of bacteria, heating LPS  in the presence of an acid, and hydrolyzing LPS in the presence of sodium carbonate to remove Kdo and a 1-phosphate group or an acyl chain, or by a chemical synthesis method. However, these methods involve complicated processes and produce low yields.  
 [4]    When introducing foreign genes into bacteria by using a genetic engineering method, the bacteria may eliminate the foreign gene by natural mutagenesis to inhibit ex-pression of the foreign gene. Such natural mutagenesis may cause a reduction in genetic engineering transformation efficiency and stability of the genetic engineering. 151        Therefore, there is a need to develop a method of producing MLA and derivatives thereof that is simpler than methods of the related art, does not involve acid hydrolysis, reduces the probability of natural mutagenesis that reduces MLA production, and results in constitutive expression of MLA and derivatives thereof such that yield is increased. Disclosure o f Inve ntion Technical Problem [6]    One or more embodiments include a bacterium that constitutively produces monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA). [71    One or more embodiments include a method of producing MLA with a high yield. [8]    Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments. [91    According to one or more embodiments, there is provided a bacterium that constitutively produces monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA), wherein the bacterium includes an LpxE  polypeptide, and a chromosome of the bacterium includes a mutation in a polynucleotide that encodes an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (Und-PP phosphatase), a polynucleotide that encodes a phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase (PGP phosphatase), or a combination thereof. [10] According to one or more embodiments, a method of producing monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) includes: culturing the bacterium according to any of the above described embodiments to obtain a culture; collecting the bacterium from the culture; and isolating MLA from the collected bacterium.  Solution to Problem [11] This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2017-0085406, filed on July 5, 2017, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office. [12] The term "increase expression" used herein refers to a detectable increase in expression product of a certain gene, for example, mRNA or a protein encoded by the gene in a cell.  The term "parent bacterial cell "used herein refers to a bacterial cell of the same type that does not have a particular genetic modification. When a wild-type cell is used in the genetic modification, the parent bacterial cell may be a "wild-type" cell. For example, bacterium comprising a genetic modification that increases expression of a gene may have higher level of expression product than that of parent bacterial cell by about 5% or more, about 10% or more, about 15% or more, about 20% or more, about 30% or more, about 40% or more, about 50% or more, about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, about 90% or more, about 95% or more, or about 100%  or more.  Increase in expression product in a cell may be verified by any methods known in the art. The level of expression product may be determined by measuring activities or quantities of the expression product such as mRNA or Date Recue/Date Received 2021-02-17 protein. [13]    Genetic modification includes a modification that introduces a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide into a cell; a modification that substitutes, adds (i.e., inserts), or deletes one or more nucleotides of the genetic material of a parent cell, including a chemical modification (exposure to a chemical) resulting in a change to the genetic material of a parent cell. Genetic modification includes a heterologous or homologous modification of referenced species. Genetic modification includes a modification of a coding region for polypeptides. Genetic modification also includes a modification of non-coding regulatory regions that change expression of a gene or function of an operon. Non-coding regions include 5'-non-coding sequence (5' of a coding sequence) and 3'-non-coding sequence (3 of a coding sequence). [14]    The term "sequence identity" of a nucleic acid or polypeptide used herein refers to a degree of identity of nucleotides or amino acid residues of two corresponding sequences over a particular region measured after the sequences are aligned to be matched with each other as much as possible. The sequence identity is a value that is measured by comparing two optimally aligned corresponding sequences of a particular comparable region, wherein in the comparable region, a part of the sequence may be added or deleted compared to a reference sequence. In some embodiments, a percentage of the sequence identity may be calculated by comparing two optimally aligned corresponding sequences in an entire comparable region, determining the number of locations where an amino acid or a nucleic acid is identical in the two sequences to obtain the number of matched locations, dividing the number of the matched locations by the total number (that is, a range size) of all locations within a comparable range, and multiplying the result by 100 to obtain a percentage of the sequence identity. The percent of the sequence identity may be determined by using known sequence comparison programs, examples of which include BLASTN and BLASTP (NCBI), CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio.), MegAlign'm (DNASTAR Inc). [15]    In identifying polypeptides or polynucleotides of different species that may have identical or similar function or activity, similarity in sequence identity may be used.  For example, similar sequences may have a sequence identity of 50% or more, 55% or more, 60% or more, 65% or more. 70% or more, 75% or more, 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more. 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, 99% or more, or 100%. [16]    The term "exogenous" and the like used herein refers to a referenced molecule (e.g., nucleic acid) or referenced activity that has been introduced into a host cell. A nucleic acid may be exogenously introduced into a host in any suitable manner. For example, a nucleic acid can be introduced into a host cell and inserted into a host chromosome, or the nucleic acid can be introduced into the host as non-chromosomal genetic material, such as an expression vector (e.g., a plasmid) that does not integrate into the host chromosome. A nucleic acid encoding a protein should be introduced in an expres-sionable form (i.e., so that the nucleic acid can be transcribed and translated). The exogenous gene may include a homologous gene, i.e., an identical gene with the en-dogenous gene, or a heterologous gene. [17]    An aspect provides a bacterium that constitutively produces monophosphoryl lipid A  (MLA). [18]    The bacterium may include a genetic modification that increases expression of a gene encoding LpxE polypeptide as compared to a parent bacterial cell. A chromosome of the bacterium may include a mutation of a polynucleotide that encodes an unde-caprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (Und-PP phosphatase), a mutation of a polynu-cleotide that encodes a phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphatase (PGP  phosphatase), or a combination thereof. [19]    Lipid A moiety in monophosphoryl lipid A consists of two glucosamines (carbohydrates or sugars) with attached acyl chains, and normally contains one phosphate group in each glucosamine. Two disaccharides may linked by p(1-)6) linkage. The acyl chain may be directly attached to hydroxyl residue selected from the group of hydroxyl residue at C-2, C-2', C-3 and C-3 positions of glucosamine dis-accharide. The acyl chain may have hydroxyl residue, for example at C-3 position thereof and additional acyl chain may be attached to hydroxyl residue located in the acyl chain. Each of the acyl chain attached may have identical or different.  Depending on the number of acyl chains, lipid A may be tri-acylated lipid A, tetra-acylated lipid A, penta-acylated lipid A. or hexa-acylated lipid A, hepa-acylated lipid A.  Lipid A that effectively activates an immune system is known to contain six acyl chains.  Four acyl chains attached directly to the glucosamines may be beta hydroxy acyl chains consisting of 10 to 22 carbons, and two additional acyl chains are mostly attached to a beta hydroxy group. [20]    The MLA refers to a monophosphoryl lipid A in which only one phosphate group is joined to C-1 or C-4' position of glucosamine disaccharide. The MLA may be tri-acylated MLA, tetra-acylated MLA, penta-acylated MLA, hexa-acylated MLA, or hepta-acylated MLA. For example. the MLA may be 1-dephospho-lipid A, 1-dephospho-tetra-acylated lipid A, 1-dephospho-penta-acylated lipid A, or a com-bination thereof. [21]    The MLA may not include 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (Kdo). Kdo is a component of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) conserved in almost all LPS. [22]    The MLA may be present in a membrane, for example, in an outer membrane, of a living bacterium. [23]    The term "bacterium" as used herein refers to a prokaryotic bacterium.  The bacterium

A lipid phosphate phosphatase is a hydrolase, specifically acting to phosphoric monoester bonds, which may remove a phosphate group from a lipid containing a phosphate group. The LpxE may be phosphate phosphatase specifically dephosphorylating the 1-position. The LpxE polypeptide may be an LpxE  polypeptide of bacterium selected from the group consisting of Aquifex genus bacterium, Hell-cobacter genus bacterium, Francisella genus bacterium, Bordetella genus bacterium, Brucella genus bacterium, Rhizobium genus bacterium, Mesorhizobium genus bacterium, Legionella genus bacterium, Agrobacterium genus bacterium, Chlorobiurn genus bacterium, Rhodospirillurn genus bacterium, Magnetospirillum genus bacterium, Chlorobaculum genus bacterium, Pelodictyon genus bacterium, Pseudovibro genus bacterium, Phaeospirillum genus bacterium, Syntrophobacter genus bacterium, Bradyrhizobium genus bacterium, Porphyromonas genus bacterium.

The term "bacterial chromosome", which contains genetic in-formation of the bacterium, may be circular DNA. The bacterium chromosome may be plasmid-free. A plasmid refers to circular DNA that is physically separate from a bacterial chromosome and can replicate independently. [30]    The Und-PP phosphatase is an enzyme that produces an undecaprenyl phosphate by catalyzing dephosphorylation of an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate. An undecaprenyl phosphate is a lipid carrier of a glycan biosynthetic intermediate for a hydrocarbon polymer that is transmitted to the envelope of bacteria. [31]    The polynucleotide that encodes the Und-PP phosphatase may be a bacA  gene, a pgpB gene, a ybjG gene, or a combination thereof. The bacA gene is a gene of which overexpression confers resistance to a known antibiotic, bacitracin. The pgpB  gene is a gene that encodes an enzyme catalyzing dephosphorylation of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) to generate phosphatidyl glycerol (PG). This enzyme may have the

For example, the mutation may be a deletion, an insertion, a point mutation, a frameshift mutation, or a combination thereof. The point mutation may be a missense mutation or a nonsense mutation. By a mutation, genetic material may be deleted from or introduced into the genome of the bacterium. [36]    The bacterium according to one or more embodiments may further include a polynu-cleotide encoding a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of a LpxL  polypeptide and a LpxM polypeptide. The polynucleotide may be inducible or consti-tutively expressed.

After an organic solvent layer was isolated from the centrifuged mixture, the organic solvent layer was extracted twice by adding a pre-equilibrated organic solvent layer to the upper aqueous layer. The organic solvent layer was pooled, and then dried in a rotary evaporator to obtain lipids. The obtained lipids were dissolved in 5 mL of a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform and methanol, and then subjected to ultrasonic irradiation in a water bath.  The ultrasonically irradiated lipids were moved to a new test tube, and the obtained lipid s were dried at room temperature in a nitrogen gas environment and then stored at about -80 C. [150]    3.4. Lipid analysis by thin layer chromatography (TLC) [151]    Membrane lipids of each E. coli strain obtained as described above in Section 3.3 was analyzed using, as positive control groups, MPLA Synthetic (InvovoGen, Catalog Code: tlrl-mpls, synthetic 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A (Lane 6 of FIG.  5, and Lane 1 of FIG. 6), and MPLA-SM (InvovoGen, Catalog Code tlrl-mpla, 1-dephospho-lipid A separated and purified from lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Salmonella minnesota R595 after acid-based hydrolysis) (Lane 7 of FIG. 5).     11521    To perform thin layer chromatography (TLC), as described above in Section 3.2, lipid was obtained from 200 mL of each E. coli culture solution, and one-third of the obtained total liquid was dissolved in 200 AL of a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform and methanol. Subsequently, about 5 !IL to 15 [LI, of the mixture was spotted on a 10x10 cm high-performance TLC (HPTLC) plate (EMD Chemicals) and developed in a solvent mixture of chloroform, methanol, water, and ammonium hydroxide (28%  (v/v) ammonia) in a ratio of 40:25:4:2 (v/v). The developed plate was then dried, visualized by spraying with 10% (v/v) of sulfuric acid (in ethanol), and then heated on a hot plate of 300 C. The TLC results of the liquids are shown in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7. [153]    FIG. 5 is an image showing TLC results of lipids extracted from the E. coli strains from which bacA gene of the E. coli genome was removed and replaced with a phosphatase gene. In FIG. 5, Lane 1 represents KHSC0044 producing 1-dephospho-lipid A (two of the 8 colonies cultured in the same cell stock), Lane 2 represents KHSC0044 not producing 1-dephospho-lipid A (six of the 8 colonies cultured in the same cell stock, Lane 3 represents KHSC0031 producing 1-dephospho-lipid A (six of the 7 colonies cultured in the same cell stock), Lane 4 represents KHSC0031 not producing 1-dephospho-lipid A (one of the 7 colonies cultured in the same cell stock), Lane 5 represents KHSC0045 stably producing 1-dephospho-lipid A (all of the 7 colonies cultured in the same cell stock.  Lane 6 represents the synthetic 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A (InvovoGen, Catalog Code:  tlrl-mpls), and Lane 7 represents 1-dephospho-lipid A separated and purified from Salmonella minnesota R595 after acid-base hydrolysis (InvovoGen, Catalog Code:  tlrl-mpla). [154]    FIG. 6 is an image showing TLC results of the lipids of the E. coli strains KHSC0045 and KHSC0055. In FIG. 6, Lane 1 represents the synthetic 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A (InvovoGen, Catalog Code: tlrl-mpls), Lane 2 represents KHSC0045 cultured with an overexpression inducer to induce overexpression of a lipidation enzyme, and Lane 3 represents KHSC0055 cultured without use of an overexpression inducer. [155]    FIG. 7 is an image showing TLC results of lipids of E. coli strains KHSC0045 and KHSC0055. wherein Lane 1 represents KHSC0055 cultured with an antibiotics, and Lane 3 represents KHSC0055 cultured without use of the antibiotics. [156]    Referring to FIG. 5, even though the cell stocks of KHSC0044 and KHSC0031 were each derived from one colony, the selected 8 colonies of KHSC0044 were found to include colonies in which 1-dephospho-lipid A was detected (Lane 1, two of the colonies), and colonies in which 1-dephospho-lipid A was not detected (Lane 2, six of the 8 colonies), and the selected 7 colonies of KHSC0031 were found to include colonies in which 1-dephospho-lipid A was detected (Lane 3, six of the 7 colonies) and a colony in which 1-dephospho-lipid A was not detected (Lane 4, one of the 7 colonies). However, 1-dephospho-lipid A was detected in all of the selected 7 colonies of KHSC0045 (Lane 5). [157]    These results indicate that when a phosphatase is inserted into the genome of E. coli, an E. coli strain producing 1-dephospho-lipid A may inactivate the activity of the inserted phosphatase, thereby forming easily natural mutant that cannot produce 1-dephospho-lipid A. [158]    Therefore, it was found that, to produce 1-dephospho-lipid A by insertion of a phosphatase into the genome of E. coli, removing an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase (Und-PP phosphatase) gene (bacA, pgpB, or ybjG) or phosphatidylglyc-erophosphate phosphatase (PGP phosphatase) gene (pgpB, pgpA, or pgpC), which are present in the genome of E. coli, or a combination of these genes (Lane 1, Lane 3, or Lane 5 of FIG. 5), is necessary to stably produce 1-dephospho-lipid A from E.  coli and yield live E. roll with a reduced probability of natural mutation. [159]    For the E. coli KHSC0045, overexpression of a lipidation enzyme during incubation of the strain is necessary to effectively produce 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A. As a result of the membrane lipid composition comparison using the synthetic 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A (Lane 1 of FIG. 6) and KHSC0045 incubated by inducing the overexpression of a lipidation enzyme with an overexpression inducer as positive control groups, the E. coli KHSC0055 transformed into pKHSC0004 was found to be a live E. coli strain effectively producing 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A (Lane 3 of FIG. 6) without use of an overexpression inducer (Lane 3 of FIG.  6). [160]    For the E. coli KHSC0055, while the plasmid pKHSC0004 stably sustained in the E.  coli KHSC0055, the E. coli KHSC0055 effectively produced 1-dephospho-hexa acylated lipid A with antibiotics (Lane 1 of FIG. 7) or without use of the antibiotics (Lane 2 of FIG. 7). [161]    As described above, according to the one or more embodiments, a bacterium that constitutively produces MLA and a method of producing MLA by using the bacterium may simply produce MLA and a derivative thereof without acid hydrolysis, have a reduced probability of natural mutation, and produce increased yields of MLA  and a derivative thereof by constitutive expression of the MLA and derivative thereof.
