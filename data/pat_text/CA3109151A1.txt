FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE:  
 [0002]          The present disclosure relates to probiotics. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to isolated strains of probiotic bacteria from free ranging wolves and related compositions and methods. BACKGROUND:  
 [0003]          The gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of most mammals are colonized by native micro-organisms forming a microbiota. In a healthy animal, there is a balance between beneficial or benign bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. Intestinal dysbiosis refers to an imbalance of the microbiota of the intestine. Dysbiosis in microbiota of the intestine may cause a shift in the balance of immunostimulatory cytokines in the GI tract. This shift in immunostimulatory cytokines may in turn alter the balance of the inflammatory signals in the gut, causing diarrhea and other acute and chronic GI disorders.  
 [0004]    Probiotics may help to restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in the GI tract and therefore may be useful in treating intestinal dysbiosis and GI disorders.  
 [0005]          Although probiotics have conventionally been used only in humans, there is increasing interest in use of probiotics in companion animals such as dogs. However, commercially-available canine probiotics are generally of human origin and are not optimal for animals since probiotic bacteria typically possess host-specific traits (Oh et al., "Diversification of the gut symbiont Lactobacteria reuteri as a result of host-driven evolution", ISME    J, 2010, Vol 4: pp 377-387; Frese et al., "The evolution of host specialization in the vertebrate gut symbiont Lactobacillus reuteri", PloS Genet., 2011.  7:e1001314).  
 [0006]    Some canine probiotics isolated from dogs are known. However, the nutritional profile of commercial pet foods may result in alterations in the intestinal microbiome of domestic dogs and not all probiotics isolated from domestic dogs may be effective in counteracting intestinal dysbiosis.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS: [0054]          Generally, the present disclosure provides isolated strains of gastrointestinal bacteria from wolves for use as probiotics. In some embodiments, the isolated strains are for use as probiotics in canine subjects such as domestic dogs. In some embodiments, the isolated strains may be used to treat or prevent intestinal dysbiosis in the subject. Also provided is a composition comprising at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria and a related method for making same. [0055]          As used herein, "probiotic" refers to a microbial cell culture or preparation that has at least one beneficial effect on a host organism. The beneficial effects on the host organism may include, for example, a beneficial effect on the host's digestive system and/or immune and/or brain-gut-microbiome systems. Embodiments are not limited by the specific beneficial effects described herein. [0056]          The present disclosure provides isolated strains of gastrointestinal bacteria from free ranging wolves for use as a probiotic. As used herein, "wolf" refers to an animal of the Canis lupus species, including any known subspecies, with the exception of Canis lupus familiaris. A wolf may also be known as a gray wolf, grey wolf, timber wolf, or tundra wolf. In some embodiments, the wolves are free-ranging wolves native to Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan, Canada. [0057]         As used herein, "gastrointestinal bacteria" refer to bacteria that are native to the gastrointestinal tract of an animal. As used herein, "isolated" or "isolate", when used in reference to a strain of bacteria, refers to bacteria that have been separated from their natural environment. In some embodiments, the isolated strain or isolate is a biologically pure culture of a specific strain of bacteria. As used herein, "biologically pure" refers to a culture that is substantially free of other strain of organisms.      [0058]    In some embodiments, the isolated strain of gastrointestinal bacteria from a wolf is isolated from wolf feces. In some embodiments, the isolated stain may be isolated from wolf feces using the methods described in the Examples below. [0059]         The isolated strain of gastrointestinal bacteria from a wolf may be used as a probiotic in a subject. In some embodiments, the subject is a canine subject. As used herein, "canine" refers to an animal of the Canis genus including wolves, dogs (as defined below), and hybrids thereof. [0060]         In some embodiments, the canine subject is a domestic dog. As used herein, "dog" or "domestic dog" refers to an animal of the Canis lupus familiaris subspecies. Some taxonomic authorities alternatively recognize domestic dogs as a distinct species Canis familiaris. In some embodiments, the dog is an adult dog. In other embodiments, the dog is at any other stage of development. [0061]         In some embodiments, the isolated strain is a strain of lactic acid bacteria. In some embodiments, the isolated strain is a Lactobacillus species (also known as lactobacilii). In other embodiments, the isolated strain is an Enterococcus species. In other embodiments, the isolated strain is any other genus of gastrointestinal bacteria native to a wolf gastrointestinal tract.     [0062]                                                               In some embodiments, the isolated strain of gastrointestinal bacteria is one of Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus animalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus curvatus.      [0063]    In some embodiments, the isolated strain of gastrointestinal bacteria is one of the strains listed in Table 1 below. For each bacterial strain in Table 1, a biologically pure stock of each isolate was deposited in the International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC) (1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2) under the Budapest Treaty on December 18, 2018. Gram staining results showing the bacterial morphologies of each of the isolated strains of Table 1 are shown in Figure 1.

ID NO: 7         Figure 2G [0065]          In some embodiments, the isolated strain is a mutant of one of 5    the strains listed in Table 1. As used herein, a "mutant" or a "mutant strain" refers to a bacterial strain that has at least 95% homology, at least 96%  homology, at least 97% homology, at least 98% homology, at least 99%  homology, or at least 99.5% homology to the 16S rDNA sequence of a reference bacterial strain but that otherwise has one or more DNA mutations 10    in one or more other DNA sequences in the bacterial genome. DNA  mutations may include base substitutions including transitions and transversions, deletions, insertions, and any other type of natural or induced DNA  modification. [0066]          In some embodiments, the isolated strain may be further characterized by whole genome sequencing, as described in more detail in the Examples below. In some embodiments, the isolated strain has at least one adhesion gene, bacteriocin gene, copper homeostasis gene, and/or bile hydrolysis gene. In some embodiments, the isolated strain does not have any genes encoding toxins or superantigens. [0067]    The isolated strain may be capable of probiotic activity in the subject. As used herein, "probiotic activity" refers to the ability of the bacteria of the isolated strain to produce at least one beneficial effect in the subject. In some embodiments, the isolated strain of bacteria is capable of surviving and colonizing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject to provide the beneficial effect to the subject. [0068]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are tolerant to low pH, indicating that the bacteria may be capable of surviving passage through the acidic canine stomach. As used herein, "low pH" refers to a pH of 6.9 or less. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to survive in vitro at a pH of about 2.5 to about 6.9 for at least 2 hours. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to survive in vitro at a pH of about 3.0 to about 6.9 for at least 6 hours. Survival may be measured using plate count methods, as described in the Examples below, or any other suitable method. As used herein, "survive" means that the viable cell count of a test culture (as measured in colony forming units (CFU) per mL) is above detection limit [1.710g10(CFU/mL) 0r50 CFU/mL]. [0069]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are tolerant to the presence of bile salt, indicating that the bacteria may survive the passage through the canine intestine. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to survive in vitro in the presence of 5% bile salts for at least 24 hours. [0070]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are tolerant to the presence of at least one gastric digestive enzyme. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to survive in vitro for at least 2 hours in SGF at pH 3.0 in the presence of pepsin (3.2 mg/mL). In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are tolerant to the presence of at least one intestinal digestive enzyme. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to survive in vitro in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) for at least 24 hours at pH 6.8 in the presence of pancreatin (10 mg/mL). [0071]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain have autoaggregation ability, indicating that the bacterial cells may be able to bind host intestinal epithelial cells in the subject to facilitate colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. As used herein, "autoaggregation" or "autoaggregate"  refers to the bacterial cells binding to one another to floc out of solution.  Autoaggregation may be measured by measuring the 0D600 of a stationary liquid bacterial culture over time, as described in more detail in the Examples below, or by any other suitable method. [0072]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain have high cell surface hydrophobicity, indicating that the bacterial cells may be able to adhere to host cells in the subject to facilitate colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Cell surface hydrophobicity may be measured by Microbial Adhesion to Hydrocarbons (MATH), as described in more detail in the Examples below, or by any other suitable method. [0073]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are able to bind to canine cells in vitro. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to bind canine epithelial cells in vitro, for example, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK (NBL-2), Canis familiaris ATCC CCL-34)) cells. In some embodiments, the bacteria are able to bind canine macrophage-like cells in vitro, for example, DH82 cells (Canis familiaris ATCC CRL-10389). In other embodiments, the bacteria may be able to bind any other suitable type of canine cell. [0074]    In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are able to modulate expression of at least one anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory cytokine by host immune cells. Non-limiting examples of anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory cytokines include IL-10, IL-6, TGF-r3 and any other known anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory cytokine. In some embodiments, the ability to stimulate expression of at least one anti-inflammatory cytokine can be measured by incubating cytokine-expressing cells in the presence of bacteria of the isolated strain and measuring cytokine expression by real-time quantitative FOR (RT-qPCR), as described in more detail in the Examples below, or by any other suitable method.     [0075]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are able to inhibit growth of at least one pathogenic or spoilage microorganism.  In some embodiments, the bacteria produce an inhibitory substance that inhibits the growth of at least one pathogenic or spoilage microorganism. In some embodiments, the pathogenic microorganism is a canine intestinal pathogen. Examples of microorganisms that may be inhibited by the isolated strain include Enteropathogenic Escherichia coil E2348/69, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Listeria monocyto genes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile.      .. However, embodiments are not limited to the microorganisms described herein. The production of inhibitory substances may be tested by growing an indicator strain (e.g. a strain of a pathogenic or spoilage microorganism) in the presence of the isolated strain, as described in more detail in the Examples below. If the isolated strain produces inhibitory substances, growth of the indicator strain may be inhibited presence of the isolates strain.  Alternatively, the inhibitory activity of the isolated strain may be tested by any other suitable method. [0076]          In some embodiments, the bacteria of the isolated strain are susceptible to at least one antibiotic. Antibiotic susceptibility may be desirable .. to prevent the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria, including pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotic susceptibility may be tested using the methods described in the Examples below, or by any other suitable method.  The lowest antibiotic concentration for which no bacteria growth is observed is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In some embodiments, the isolated strain has an MIC value for at least one antibiotic that is at or below the MIC breakpoint value set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  Examples of antibiotics to which the isolated strain may be susceptible include, for example, ampicillin, gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. However, embodiments are not limited to the antibiotics described herein.     [0077]          In some embodiments, a lyophilized (freeze-dried) form of the isolated strain is substantially stable for a suitable shelf-life period. As used herein, "substantially stable" means that at least 50% of the bacterial cells are still viable at the end of a given time period, as measured in CFU/g. In some embodiments, the lyophilized form of the isolated strain is substantially stable for at least 10 weeks at 4 C. [0078]          The isolated strains of wolf probiotic bacteria described above may be used to improve and/or maintain the health of the subject. In some embodiments, at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria may be used to treat or prevent intestinal dysbiosis in the subject or treat the subject for a health condition or disorder. As used herein, "treat" or "treatment"  refers to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The effect can be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a health condition or symptom thereof and/or can be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for the health condition and/or adverse effect attributable to the health condition. In some embodiments, at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria may be used to treat or prevent diarrhea in the subject. In other embodiments, at least one strain of wolf probiotic bacteria may be used to provide any other health benefit to the subject. In some embodiments, at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria may be used in the preparation of a medicament for treatment or prevention of intestinal dysbiosis, diarrhea, or any other suitable health condition. [0079]          Without being limited by theory, it is believed that some commercial pet foods have a materially different nutritional profile compared to the fats, proteins and carbohydrates within the prey hunted and consumed by wolves. Such nutritional profile differences may result in alterations to the intestinal microbiome in domestic dogs. By introducing gastrointestinal bacteria from a wolf into the GI tract of a dog, the dog's intestinal microbiome may shift towards more of an ancestral state and thereby treat or prevent dysbiosis.     [0080]          The isolated strain may be administered to the subject in an effective amount. As used herein, "effective amount" refers to an amount of the isolated strain that provides at least one health benefit to the subject.  The effective amount may vary based on a number of factors including but not 5 limited to the specific isolated strain being administered and its characteristics; the age, weight, sex, diet, and general health of the subject;  the mode and time of administration; the severity of the condition being treated; the nature of any concurrent therapies or medications; and any other relevant factor. 10    [0081]    In some preferred embodiments, the isolated strain is orally administrable to the subject. In other embodiments, the isolated strain may be enterally and/or rectally administrable to the subject. In some embodiments, the isolated strain may be administered to the subject at any suitable interval including, for example, at least once per month, at least once per week, or at 15    least once per day. In some embodiments, per 20 lbs of body weight of the subject, about 1 billion CFU per daily serving may be orally administered to the subject. [0082]          In some embodiments, the isolated strain is administrable in a viable form. In some embodiments, the isolated strain is administrable in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) form.

[0106]          Without any limitation to the foregoing, the present strains, 15    compositions, uses, and methods are further described by way of the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 ¨ Bacterial Isolation [0107]          Feces samples from free ranging wolves were collected from Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan, Canada, which is distant from 20    cities, human populations, and farming areas. The wolves can range freely and are distant from chemicals utilized by humans, such as pesticides and antibiotics. All feces samples were shipped to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in a StyrofoamTM box with icepacks and were kept frozen upon receipt until further analysis.      [0108]    Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the free ranging wolf feces samples using a three-step isolation method described below. [0109]          Step I (Selective Enrichment): A pea-sized piece of feces was collected and inoculated into 30 mL of MRS (De Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe) nutrient broth containing with 20 pg/mL nalidixic acid. The feces/broth mixture was mixed well by vortexing and then incubated at 37 C for 24 h (hours) under airtight conditions. [0110]          Step ll (Selective Plating): The feces/broth mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet the fecal matter. The resulting liquid upper phase (i.e. supernatant) was transferred to a new sterile 50 mL  conical tube. The supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 minutes to concentrate/pellet the bacteria. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 pL of MRS broth. One hundred pL of re-suspended bacterial culture was spread plated onto a LAMVAB (Lactobacillus anaerobic MRS with vanomycin and bromocresol green) agar plate (5.2% MRS broth, 0.25 mg/mL Cysteine-HCI, 0.025 mg/mL Bromocresol green, 2 mg/mL Vancomycin-HCI, and 2% agar;  Hartemink et al., "LAMVAB ¨ a new selective medium for the isolation of lactobacilli from faeces", Journal of Microbiological Methods 1997, Vol. 29, pp: 77-84). All agar plates were subsequently incubated at 37 C for 48 to 72 hours under ambient conditions. [0111]          Step III (Single Colony Purification): Single colonies or bacterial lawn from a LAMVAB agar plate were streaked onto MRS agar plates and incubated at 37 C for 48 h. Single colonies on an MRS agar plate were re-streaked on a new MRS agar plate. This step was repeated until a pure culture on an agar plate was achieved. [0112]          All isolates were grouped based on their origin i.e. host (wolf feces collected on different dates or from different spots were considered to be from different wolves) and colony morphologies. Typical isolates from each host were selected for further analysis. [0113]          One single colony of each isolate was inoculated into 10 mL of MRS broth and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. The fully-grown culture was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for two minutes. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was re-suspended with 1.5 mL of fresh MRS  broth, followed by adding 0.5 mL of 80% glycerol and mixing well by pipetting.    The glycerol culture stock was stored at -80 C for long term storage and further analysis.      [0114]    Seven isolates of wolf probiotic bacteria, labeled WF-1, WF-2, WF-3, WF-4, WF-5, WF-6, and WF-7, were obtained using the methods described above. EXAMPLE 2 ¨ Isolate Identification Isolate Cultivation [0115]    One loopful of each frozen culture stock was streaked on an MRS agar plate and incubated at 37 C for 48 h. One single colony was inoculated into 5 mL of MRS broth and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. One percent of the inoculum (50 pL) was sub-cultured into 5 mL of MRS broth and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. The fully-grown culture was ready for further analysis. Isolate Identification by Gram Staining [0116]          A Gram-staining kit (Sigma AldrichTM) containing solutions of crystal violet, Gram's iodine, decolorizing fluid, and safranin was used in this study. One mL of fully-grown culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended with sterile water. Ten pL of each bacterial resuspension was spread on a microscope glass slide and allowed to air dry. The smear was gently flooded with crystal violet and let stand for minute. The slide was tilted slightly and rinsed with water. The smear was gently flooded with Gram's iodine and let stand for 1 minute. The slide was .. tilted slightly and rinsed with water. The smear was decolorized with decolorizing fluid for 10 seconds. The slide was tilted slightly and rinsed with water. The smear was gently flooded with safranin to counterstain and let stand for 45 seconds. The slide was tilted slightly and rinsed with water. The slide was blotted dry before being viewed under a light-microscope with oil-immersion. [0117]          The Gram-stained bacteria were visualized using a 100x lens on an OMAXTm LED 40x-2000x Digital Binocular Biological Compound Microscope and photos were obtained using a 3.0 MP USB camera connected to the microscope. Gram-positive, rod-shaped or sphere-shaped bacteria were selected for further analysis. The Gram-staining results showing the bacterial morphologies of the seven isolates are shown in Figure 1. Isolate Identification by 16S rDNA Sequencing (Sanger Sequencing) [0118]    To identify the isolates at the species level, the gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was amplified by FOR and sequenced by Sanger Sequencing. [0119]          Colony polymerase chain reaction (FOR) with bacterium specific primers 8F, SEQ ID NO:8 (nucleotide sequence: AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG    CTC AG), and 805R, SEQ ID NO:9 (nucleotide sequence: GAC TAC CAG  GGT ATC TAA TC) was used to amplify the conserved regions of the 16S  rRNA gene. Each PCR reaction mixture had a total volume of 50 pL and contained 5 pL of 10x PCR buffer, 2 pL of dNTP (10 mM), 0.5 pL of forward primer 8F (10 pM), 0.5 pL of reverse primer 805R (10 pM), 0.5 pL of Taq polymerase (5 U/pL), and 2 pL of cell suspension (1x109 CFU/mL) as template. [0120]          PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (110V, 60 min) and visualized under UV (ultraviolet) light.  The target amplicon was about 800 bp. Once the correct sized band was confirmed, the remaining PCR product was purified using a GeneJETTm PCR  product purification kit (Thermo ScientificTm). The concentrations of PCR  products were determined using a NanodropTM spectrophotometer. Each sample was submitted for Sanger Sequencing using either primer 8F or 805R.  Sequencing was performed at The Applied Genomics CentreTM (TAGC) at the University of Alberta. Resulting sequences and chromatograms were viewed using ContigExpressTM software and genus and species were determined using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) nucleotide search algorithm.      [0121]    The 16S rDNA sequencing results for the seven isolates are shown in Figures 2A to 2G. All isolates were identified as: Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus animalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus curvatus, and Lactobacillus reuteri.      Isolate Identification by RAPD Profiling [0122]          To eliminate duplicate strains from all isolates, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) FOR was used. This experiment was performed to compare isolates from the same host (referring to wolf feces collected on the same day and at the same place/area), not isolates from different sources.      Colony FOR was performed using the M13 primer, SEQ ID NO:10 (nucleotide sequence GAGGGTGGCGGTTCT, Rossetti and Giraffe, "Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-FOR fingerprint databases", J Microbiol Methods, 2005, Vol. 63, pp: 135-144). This primer was chosen because it has low specificity and binds at numerous loci within bacterial genomic DNA (gDNA). [0123]          Agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis of the FOR products provided a banding pattern (visible using a UV table) whereby duplicates of the same strain had the same banding pattern resulting in elimination of the duplicate from further study. Isolates that had unique banding patterns were included for further study. [0124]          Figure 4 shows the RAPD profile of three of the seven isolates:  Lactobacillus brevis WF-5, Lactobacillus curvatus WF-6, and Lactobacillus reuteri WF-7. The other isolates did not need RAPD profile identification because they either belong to different species or originate from a different wolf. Isolate Identification by Whole Genome Sequencing (llluminaTM Sequencing) [0125]          To identify the selected isolates at the strain level, whole 5 genome sequencing (llluminaTM Sequencing) was performed to get more detailed information of each strain. A WizardTM Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Tm) was used to isolate gDNA from each isolate. The concentration and quality of each gDNA sample was first determined using a NanodropTM  spectrophotometer and further confirmed with 1% agarose gel 10    electrophoresis. The qualified gDNA samples (A260/A280 was between 1.8 and 2.0; A260/A230 was over 2.0; Total yield was over 2,000 ng) were shipped to Quebec GenomicsTM (Quebec, Quebec) for llluminaTM sequencing. Resulting sequences were analyzed with a serial of software. The adapter sequences were removed with TrimmomaticTm software, followed by sequence assembly 15 with SPAdesTM software and assembly quality assessment with QUASTTm software. Scaffolding was done using MedusaTM web server. Strain Deposit [0126]          The International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC; 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2) is a patent 20 depository for microorganisms that has been made possible by Canada's accession to the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Micro-Organisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure (the Budapest Treaty) on September 21, 1996. [0127]          Ten vials (0.5 mL each) of each isolate in frozen state (with 20% 25    glycerol) were shipped in a StyrofoamTM box with dry ice to the IDAC in Winnipeg, Canada for deposit. The isolated strains were deposited on December 18, 2018 and an accession number was assigned to each strain by the IDAC as listed in Table 1 above.     EXAMPLE 3 ¨ Isolate Characterization Whole Genome Sequence Analysis [0128]         Genome annotation was done by uploading a FASTA file of contigs onto the RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) server and a detailed annotation report of each strain was generated. Bioinformatics software (e.g. GeneiousTM) and online databases and tools (e.g. via the National Center for Biotechnology Information website) were used to identify the presence or absence of specific functioning genes (e.g.  bacteriocin encoding genes, host adhesion factors, and bile salt tolerance genes), virulence genes, and antibiotic resistance genes, and determine whether certain antibiotic resistance genes are transferable or not. Table 3 shows the results of whole genome sequence analysis of the seven isolates.

For each strain, 1% fully-grown culture (2 pL) was sub-cultured into 198 pL of MRS broth and incubated at 37 C for 60 hours. Four strains, Lb. fermentum ATCC 14931, Lb. reuteri ATCC 23272, Lb. casei K9-1, and Lb. fermentum K9-2, were included as controls. One well containing 200 pL of MRS broth only was used as a sterility control. All tests were done in triplicate. [0130]          Optical densities of each strain were plotted as a function of time, which was defined as the growth curve of each strain. The growth curves of the seven wolf isolates and controls are shown in Figure 5. It took about 24 h for all strains to reach late exponential or early stationary growth phase. Auto-Aggregation Ability [0131]          To assess the auto-aggregation ability of the isolates, auto-aggregation assays were performed. For each isolate, 30 mL of fully-grown culture was mixed thoroughly by vortexing. The initial optical density at 600 nm (0D600, Ao) was measured and recorded. The remaining cell suspension was kept still and undisturbed at ambient temperature for 5 hours. One hundred pL of the upper suspension (the cell suspension was not vortexed) was taken at one-hour intervals to measure the OD600nm (At). The auto-aggregation percentage was expressed as: At ¨ ¨   wherein Ao stands for 0D600 at 0 h, and At stands for 0D600 at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, h, or 5 h. The auto-aggregation rates (in percentage) of the seven wolf isolates are shown in Figure 6. Cell Surface Hydrophobicity [0132]          To assess the hydrophobic nature of the bacterial cell surface of each isolate, microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) assays (Otero et al.    "Bacterial surface characteristics applied to selection of probiotic microorganisms", in Public Health Microbiology 2004, pp. 435-440. Humana Press) were performed to measure the hydrophobicity of bacterial strains in terms of adhesion. For each isolate, 10 mL of fully-grown culture was harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for two minutes, followed by washing the cells with saline solution three times. The cell pellet was resuspended with saline solution and the 0D600 of each cell suspension was adjusted to 0.5 0.1. The actual final 0D600 of each cell suspension was measured and recorded. Three point six mL of cell suspension was aliquoted to a glass testing tube, followed by aliquoting 0.6 mL of solvent (toluene or xylene) to the same glass testing tube and vortexing vigorously for 1 minute. The testing tube was kept still for 1 hour to allow the immiscible solvent and aqueous phase to separate. The aqueous layer was removed with a Pasteur pipet and the 0D600 (Optest) was measured and recorded. The percentage of hydrophobicity of each strain was calculated as the following formula: % hydrophobicity = (ODinitial ODtest)/ ODinitial [0133]          The percentage hydrophobicities of the seven isolates are shown in Figure 7.     Low pH and Bile Salt Tolerance Assays [0134]          To assess the tolerance of the isolates to acidic conditions, for each isolate, 1% of fully-grown culture (10 pL) was subcultured into a set of mL solutions of Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF, without pepsin) with varying pH      values (pH = 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 6.9). The SGF solutions with different pH values were prepared by adjusting the pH of SGF with HCI and NaOH, followed by sterilization by filtering. Once a culture was inoculated into each SGF solution, the mixture was mixed thoroughly by vortexing and 60 pL of each mixture was aliquoted into the first column of a 96-well microtiter plate right away for diluting and plating. The remaining cultures were immediately incubated at 37 C under airtight conditions for 6 h. Sixty pL of each culture was aliquoted into the first column of a new 96-well microtiter plate after 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, respectively, for diluting and plating. [0135]          To assess the tolerance of the isolates to bile salt, for each isolate, 1% fully-grown culture (10 pL) was subcultured into a set of 1 mL of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, pH = 7.2) with varying bile salt concentrations (0%, 3%, and 5%). The PBS solutions with different bile salt concentrations were prepared by dissolving a corresponding amount of bile salt into sterile PBS. Once a culture was inoculated into each PBS solution, the mixture was mixed thoroughly by vortexing and 60 pL of each mixture was aliquoted into the first column of a 96-well microtiter plate right away for diluting and plating. The remaining cultures were immediately incubated at 37 C under airtight conditions for 24 h. Sixty pL of each culture was aliquoted into the first column of a new 96-well microtiter plate after 6 h and 24 h, respectively, for diluting and plating. [0136]          A serial 10-fold dilution of each culture was prepared and proper dilutions were plated on MRS agar plates and incubated at 37 C for 2 days.  Viable cell counts were recorded and expressed as the Mean [logio(CFU/mL)]    Standard Error of at least three independent replicates. The results of the low pH and bile salt tolerance assays for the seven isolates are shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. Gastric and Intestinal Digestive Enzyme Tolerance Assays [0137]          To assess the tolerance of the isolates to gastric digestive 5    enzyme, for each isolate, 1% fully-grown culture (10 pL) was subcultured into a set of 1 mL of SGF solutions (with 3.2 mg/mL of pepsin) with varying pH  values (pH = 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0). The cultures were incubated at 37  C under airtight conditions for 6 h. Sixty pL of each culture was aliquoted into the first column of a 96-well microtiter plate after 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h, respectively, 10    for diluting and plating. [0138]          To assess the tolerance of the isolates to intestinal digestive enzyme, for each isolate, 1% fully-grown culture (10 pL) was subcultured into a set of 1 mL of Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) solutions with 10 mg/mL of pancreatin at pH = 6.8. The cultures were incubated at 37 C under airtight 15    conditions for 24 h. Sixty pL of each culture was aliquoted into the first column of a 96-well microtiter plate after 0 h, 6 h, and 24 h, respectively, for diluting and plating. [0139]          A serial 10-fold dilution of each culture was prepared and proper dilutions were plated on MRS agar plates and incubated at 37 C for 2 days. 20    Viable cell counts were recorded and expressed as the Mean [logio(CFU/mL)]   Standard Error of at least three independent replicates. The results of the gastric digestive enzyme and intestinal digestive enzyme tolerance assays for the seven isolates are shown in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. Production of Inhibitory Substances 25          [0140]    To assess the ability of the isolates to produce any inhibitory substances against a series of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, the isolates were grown in the presence of a series of indicator strains. For each isolate, 1 pL of fully-grown culture was spotted on Reinforced Clostridia!  Agar (RCA) plates and incubated at 37 C overnight. Fourteen non-LAB indicator strains were cultivated in Trypticase Soy Broth with 0.6% Yeast Extract (TSBYE) at 37 C overnight. Each indicator strain (0.1%, 6 pL) was inoculated into 6 mL of RCA soft agar (with 0.75% agar) and solidified agar plates were incubated at 37 C overnight. Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454 and Enterococcus faecalis 710C were used as control strains that produce inhibitory substances against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. The inhibitory zone size without visible growth of indicator strains was measured and recorded. [0141]                                                         The results for the seven isolates are shown in Table 4. In Table 4: "Yes" indicates that an isolate produces inhibitory substances against the corresponding indicator strain; "No" indicates that the strain does not produce inhibitory substances against the corresponding indicator strain; and "n/a" means not applicable.

Yes Antibiotic Susceptibility Assay [0142]          To assess the antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates, broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods were used to determine the antibiotic 5 .. susceptibility of all isolates against eight commonly used clinical antibiotics. A variety of enterococcal and non-enterococcal control strains were also tested as listed in Tables 5 and 6 below. [0143]          Broth micro-dilution for non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria was performed following the methods according to: International Organization for 10 Standardization, Milk and milk products ¨ Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics applicable to bifidobacteria and non-enterrococcal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (ISO 10932:2012). Broth micro-dilution for enterococcal bacteria was performed following the methods according to: CLSI, Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for 15    Bacteria that Grow Aerobically, 9th edition, CLSI standard M07, Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2012. Disk diffusion methods for all bacteria were performed following the methods according to: CLSI, Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests, 11th edition, CLSI Standard M02, Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2012. Antibiotic stock solutions were prepared following the methods according to: CLSI, Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 23rd edition, CLSI Standard M100, Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2013.

Canis familiaris ATCC CCL-34 (MDCK (NBL-2)) and Canis familiaris ATCC CRL-10389 (DH82) and were resuscitated from frozen stocks stored in a liquid nitrogen tank with a complete medium in a tissue culture flask. The base medium used in this study for cell line cultivation was DMEM (Dubecco's Modified Eagle Media;      GibcoTM) with high glucose level, glutamine, and sodium pyruvate. The complete medium was composed of DMEM and 10% heat-inactivated (56 C  for 30 min) fetal bovine serum (FBS, GibcoTm). The growth condition was 37 C with 5% 002. The solution used for cell dispersion was 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin with 0.53 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). The cell line 5    cultures were maintained for two weeks after the confluence to allow full differentiation before the adhesion assay. A hemocytometer was used for cell counting. [0147]          Bacterial cell suspensions were prepared by harvesting 5 mL of fully-grown culture by centrifugation at 3,500 g for 10 min, followed by 10    washing cells with PBS (pH = 7.4) three times. The cell pellet was resuspended in base medium DMEM and adjusted to an OD600nm of around 1.0 for the seven wolf isolates and around 0.1 for control strains L.  monocytogenes ATCC 19116 and S. enterica ATCC 13311 which corresponds to about 5 x 108 CFU/mL for the wolf isolates and about 1 x 108 15    CFU/mL for the control strains. [0148]          Cell monolayers of MDCK and DH82 cells were prepared in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were inoculated at a concentration of 4 x cells per well to obtain confluence and allowed to differentiate. The culture medium was changed every two days. Once the cells were confluent, the 20    complete medium was removed followed by washing cells with PBS for three times. One mL of base medium DMEM was added to each well and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 1 h before the adhesion assay. [0149]          For each strain, a 1 mL aliquot of bacterial cell suspension was added to the confluent monolayer cells and incubated at 37 C with a 5% CO2 25    atmosphere for 2 h. One mL of base medium DMEM was added to one well to serve as a sterility control. Two hours later, the monolayer cells were washed with PBS for three times. Two hundred fifty pL of Trypsin-EDTA solution was added to each well until cell layer was dispersed, followed by adding 1.75 mL  of complete medium and aspirating cells by pipetting. Each cell suspension 30    was divided into two portions: one for evaluation of in vitro adhesion and the  
 36 other for cytokine profiling by RT-qPCR as described in more detail below.  The cell suspensions were kept at -80 C until further analysis. Note that the control strains of L. monocytogenes and S. enterica were only used for cytokine profiling and not for evaluation of in vitro adhesion.    [0150]    A serial 10-fold dilution of each culture was prepared and proper dilutions were plated on MRS agar plates and incubated at 37 C for 2 days.  Viable cell counts were recorded and expressed as the Mean [logio(CFU/mL)]  Standard Error of at least three independent replicates. The cell binding rate for each isolate was calculated as the viable cell count that bound to cell lines over the original inoculated CFU of the bacterial cell suspensions to the cell line. The results of the cell binding assays are shown in Figure 12. Cytokine Profiling [0151]         To assess the ability of the isolates to alter the expression of a series of cytokines in canine-originated cell lines, RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate the cytokine expression change at the gene level. [0152]         The primers used in the RT-qPCR experiments are listed in Table 7. In Table 7: IL = interleukin, IFN = interferon; TFG = transforming growth factor; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; GADPH = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Th1 = T helper cell type 1; Th2 = T helper cell .. type 2; F = forward primer; R = reverse primer; N/A = not applicable.

The cell suspensions were used to isolate total RNA using a QiagenTM RNeasyTM Mini Kit, followed by concentration and quality check using a NanodropTM spectrophotometer. RNA samples were kept at -80 C for further analysis. [0154]         The mRNA in the RNA samples was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a QiagenTM QuantiTectTm Reverse Transcription Kit, followed by concentration and quality check using a NanodropTM spectrophotometer. The cDNA samples were kept at -80 C for further analysis. [0155]          Each FOR reaction mixture had a total volume of 25 pL  containing 12.5 pL of 2x Master Mix, 1.5 pL of cDNA, and 1 pL of forward and 1 pL of reverse primers (10 pM) as listed in Table 4. In total nine pairs of primers, including 8 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12a, IL-1213, IFN-y, TGF-131, and TNF-a) and one endogenous control (GAPDH), were tested. [0156]         The qPCR data were normalized in each individual sample using the level of GAPDH expression. Gene expression was measured by the comparative cycle threshold method (CT) and was reported as the n-fold (n-fold=2-mcT) difference relative to the normalized expression of reference samples (cDNA preparations made from control samples). Comparisons between the n-fold values of the two groups were performed using the t- 
 38 Student test. Significance was taken at P<0.05. The results of the RT-qPCR  experiments are shown in Figure 13. EXAMPLE 4 ¨ Shelf Life Stability Studies Shelf Life of Freeze-Dried Forms of Isolated Strains [0157]    To assess the strain stability of the isolates, and thereby their potential shelf life, 800 mL of fully-grown culture of each strain was freeze-dried using 10% (w/v) maltodextrin as a cryoprotectant in a LyoStarTM II  lyophilizer. The freeze-dried products were divided into three portions, one stored at 4  C, one at 25  C, and one at 37  C, for up to 16 weeks. The viability of each sample was tested every two weeks. The results of the shelf life studies of the freeze-dried products are shown in Figure 14. Shelf Life of Freeze-Dried Forms of Isolated Strains Incorporated into DOCI   Food [0158]          The freeze-dried products were also incorporated into a commercial frozen raw dog diet (BEEF & TRIPE COMPLETE FOR DOGS, Red Dog Blue KatTM, Vancouver, BC, Canada) a 2% inclusion rate and then stored under conditions mimicking commercial production and storage conditions. Briefly speaking, 1 g of freeze-dried product was added to a portion of 50 g of dog diet, followed by mixing thoroughly by massaging and then distributing the product into five sterile stomaching bags. A first bag was sampled for viable cell count immediately (Day 0). The remaining samples were vacuum-packaged and stored at -20 C for more than one week. A  second bag was then withdrawn and kept refrigerated for seven days (Day 7).  Two days later, a third bag of sample was withdrawn and kept refrigerated for five days (Day 5). Two days after that, a fourth bag was withdrawn and kept refrigerated for three days (Day 3) and, a fifth bag was withdrawn and kept refrigerated for one day (Day 1). One set of samples without the addition of any isolates were included to monitor the change of background microflora.  
 39 The results of the shelf life studies of the freeze-dried products incorporated into frozen raw dog diet are shown in Figure 15. EXAMPLE 5 ¨ Summary of Results of Examples 3 and 4 [0159]         All seven strains were whole genome sequenced. Based on whole genome sequence analysis, all seven strains are free of genes coding for toxins and superantigens. They all have bile hydrolysis genes and adhesion genes. WF-3 and WF-6 have genes coding for bacteriocins or antibacterial peptides. [0160]         WF-2 and WF-6 showed the high auto-aggregation rate, over 80% for WF-2 and 75% for WF-6 after 3 h and over 90 % for WF-2 and 85% for WF-6 after 5 h. The remaining five strains showed relatively lower auto-aggregation rates, ranging from 30% to 55% at 5 h. These results indicate that all seven strains have the potential to adhere to host intestinal epithelial cell surface. [0161]    The MATH assay showed that WF-1, WF-2, WF-5, WF-7 had high levels of cell surface hydrophobicity (over 97%) followed by WF-4 (over 85%). WF-6 showed about 40% hydrophobicity and WF-3 was totally hydrophilic. These results indicate that, except for WF-3, all other strains have the potential to adhere to host intestinal epithelial cell surface. [0162]    The low pH change study showed that six strains (except WF-6) survived in a solution (pH = 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0) for 6 h, and WF-6 survived for 2 h in a solution with pH=2.0 or 2.5, and for 6 h when pH=3Ø Overall, WF-1 was the most acid tolerant strain, followed by WF-4, WF-7, WF-3, WF-2, WF-5.  The least acid tolerant strain was WF-6.     [0163]    The bile salt tolerance assay showed that all seven strains were bile salt tolerant. All strains could tolerate 5% bile salt for 24 h. WF-2 and WF-6 showed relatively lower tolerance to bile salt compared to the other five strains.     [0164]          The gastric digestive enzyme tolerance assay showed that five strains (except for WF-2 and WF-3) survived in a Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF, with 3.2 mg/mL of pepsin) at pH 2.0 for 2h. All strains survived in an SGF solution at pH 2.5 (except WF-2 and WF-6) or 3.0 for 6 h. WF-2 and WF-5    6 survived in an SGF solution at pH 2.5 for 4 h. [0165]          All seven strains survived in a Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) with 10 mg/mL of pancreatin, an intestinal digestive enzyme, for 24 h.  Moreover, all seven strains showed an increase in viable cell count, instead of a decrease, over time. 10          [0166]    All seven strains produced inhibitory substances against at 10 out of 14 indicator strains tested in this study. [0167]          According to the MIC cut-off values suggested by the EFSA  (European Food Safety Authority), all seven strains were resistant to at least out of 8 antibiotics tested in this study. 15          [0168]    The cell binding assay showed that all seven strains could bind to canine-originated cell lines, MDCK and DH82, which indicate that all seven strains have the capability to adhere to canine intestinal epithelial cell surfaces and colonize in the intestine. WF-5 showed the highest cell surface binding capability. 20          [0169]    The cytokine gene expression assays in canine originated cells lines, MDCK and DH82, showed that DH82 was a better cell model for immunomodulation compared to MDCK. All seven strains had the capability to modulate the expression of certain cytokines. [0170]          All seven seven strains were successfully fermented in MRS 25    broth and freeze-dried in-house, followed by storage at three different temperatures, 4 C, 25 C, and 37 C.
