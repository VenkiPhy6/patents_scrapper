 FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to compositions comprising bacterial strains and use thereof in controlling pathogenic microorganisms. 
 A respiratory tract infection (RTI) refers to any of a number of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. An infection of this type is normally further classified as an upper respiratory tract infection (URI or URTI) or a lower respiratory tract infection (LRI or LRTI). Lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, tend to be far more serious conditions than upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold. 
 Various  Bacillus subtilis  group strains were reported to antagonize pathogenic bacteria such as  Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas  and  Bacillus cereus  group microorganisms and molds such as  Fusarium, Botrytis cinerea, Phoma tracheiphila . Several bioactive components such as enzymes that degrade fungal structural polymers (protease and chitinase), lipopeptides (iturin, surfactin and fengycin), antibiotics (fengycin, surfactin, iturin and bacillomycin D) and antifungal volatiles have been identified as the main component of antagonistic mode of action (Xu, Park et al. 2016). This pathogen antagonistic characteristic has allowed them to be used as promising biological control agents and implemented in various foods and supplement preparations. 
 Identifying probiotic microbial strains which can be used in the effective and safe treatment and prophylaxis of respiratory tract infections is therefore highly desired.

 DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to compositions comprising bacterial strains and use thereof in controlling pathogenic microorganisms. Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. 
 In a search for probiotic bacterial strains that can be effectively and safely used in controlling pathogenic microorganisms, the present inventors have identified a novel strain of  Bacillus subtilis  ( B. subtilis ), termed  B.  subtilis      strain number  281. The pathogenicity of the strain was assessed using in-vitro methods such as lecithinase activity, hemolysis tests and resistance to therapeutic antibiotics.    B. subtilis   281 safety was also evaluated in-vivo through a lung infection model in mice. Lastly, the efficacy of  Bacillus subtilis  281 in inhibiting the growth of  Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Alternaria  alternate and  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  was affirmed in-vitro. 
 Collectively these assays place    B. subtilis   281 as both safe for respiratory tract infection and functional with high potential to be used in various domestic, clinical and industrial applications. 
 Thus, according to an aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated bacterial  strain  Bacillus subtilis       281 or a functional homolog thereof comprising a genomic nucleic acid sequence at least 97% identical to the nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein said isolated microbial strain is purified to a level of at least 99%. 
 According to an alternative or an additional aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated bacterial  strain  Bacillus subtilis       281 or a functional homolog exhibiting: 
 (i) growth inhibitory effects against bacteria and fungi, as shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively; 
 (ii) no lecithinase activity as determined by the absence of a white precipitate when the isolated bacterial strain or functional homolog of same is streaked out onto egg yolk agar and incubated for 24 h at 37° C.; and 
 (iii) gamma hemolytic activity when streaked onto 5% sheep blood agar and incubated for 24 h at 37° C., wherein said isolated microbial strain is purified to a level of at least 99%. 
 According to an alternative or an additional aspect of the invention there is provided an isolated bacterial  strain  Bacillus subtilis       281, a sample of which having been deposited as KCTC 13468BP a functional homolog of same. 
 KCTC 13468BP has been deposited in the Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) 181, Ipsin-gil, Jeongeup-si, Jeolllabuk-do 56212, Republic of Korea on Jan. 25, 2018. 
 The bacterial strain can be as deposited or a variant thereof, also referred to herein as a “functional homolog”. 
 The term “the microbial strain” or “the bacterial strain” can refer to the deposited strain and/or the functional homolog. 
 As used herein “functional homolog” or “functionally homologous” or “variant” or a grammatical equivalent as used herein, refers to a modification (i.e., at least one mutation) of the deposited microbial strain resulting in a microbial strain that is endowed with substantially the same ensemble of biological activities (+/−10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60% when tested under the same conditions) as that of the deposited strain (see hereinbelow and in the Examples section which follows) and can be classified to the same species or strain based on known methods of species/strain classifications. 
 Following are non-limiting criteria for identifying a functional homolog. These criteria, which are mostly genetic, combined with the functional characteristic as defined hereinbelow and in the Examples section, which follows, will be facilitate the skilled artisan in defining the scope of the functional homolog. 
 Thus, according to a specific embodiment, the deposited strain and the functional homolog belong to the same operational taxonomic units (OTU). 
 An “OTU” (or plural, “OTUs”) refers to a terminal leaf in a phylogenetic tree and is defined by a nucleic acid sequence, e.g., the entire genome, or a specific genetic sequence, and all sequences that share sequence identity to this nucleic acid sequence at the level of species. In some embodiments the specific genetic sequence may be the 16S-rRNA sequence or a portion of the 16S-rRNA (also referred to herein as “16S”) sequence or other functionally conserved genes as listed below. In other embodiments, the entire genomes of two entities are sequenced and compared. In another embodiment, selected regions such as multilocus sequence tags (MLST, MLSA), specific genes, or sets of genes may be genetically compared. In 16S-rRNA embodiments, OTUs that share at least 97% average nucleotide identity across the entire 16S or some variable region of the 16S are considered the same OTU (see e.g. Claesson M J, Wang Q, O'Sullivan O, Greene-Diniz R, Cole J R, Ros R P, and O'Toole P W. 2010. Comparison of two next-generation sequencing technologies for resolving highly complex microbiota composition using tandem variable 16S rRNA gene regions. Nucleic Acids Res 38: e200. Konstantinidis K T, Ramette A, and Tiedje J M. 2006. The bacterial species definition in the genomic era. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 361: 1929-1940). In embodiments involving the complete genome, MLSTs, specific genes, or sets of genes OTUs that share at least 95% average nucleotide identity are considered the same OTU (see e.g. Achtman M, and Wagner M. 2008. Microbial diversity and the genetic nature of microbial species. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 6: 431-440. Konstantinidis K T, Ramette A, and Tiedje J M. 2006. The bacterial species definition in the genomic era. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 361: 1929-1940). OTUs are frequently defined by comparing sequences between organisms. Such characterization employs, e.g., WGS data or a whole genome sequence. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the classification is based on DNA-DNA pairing data and/or sequence identity to functionally conserved genes or fragments thereof. 
 According to a specific embodiment a species/strain can be defined by DNA-DNA hybridization involving a pairwise comparison of two entire genomes and reflects the overall sequence similarity between them. According to a specific embodiment, a species is defined as a set of strains with at least about 70%, e.g., at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95% or more DNA-DNA relatedness and with 5 uC or less DTm and having the activities as defined hereinbelow and in the Examples section which follows. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the genomic nucleic acid sequence is at least about 97%, at least about 97.1%, at least about 97.2%, at least about 97.3%, at least about 97.4%, at least about 97.5%, at least about 97.6%, at least about 97.7%, at least about 97.8%, at least about 97.9%, at least about 98%, at least about 98.1%, at least about 98.2%, at least about 98.3%, at least about 98.4%, at least about 98.5%, at least about 98.6%, at least about 98.7%, at least about 98.8%, at least about 98.9%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.1%, at least about 99.2%, at least about 99.3%, at least about 99.4%, at least about 99.5%, at least about 99.6%, at least about 99.7%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.95% 99.95%, at least about 99.99%, at least about 99.999%, at least about 99.9999%, at least about 99.99999%, at least about 99.999999% or more DNA-DNA relatedness and with 5 uC or less DTm and having the activities hereinbelow and in the Examples section which follows. 
 Thus, for example, if there is DNA-DNA hybridization on the basis of the article of Goris et al. [Goris, J., Konstantinidis, K. T., Klappenbach, J. A., Coenye, T., Vandamme, P., and Tiedje, J M. (2007). DNA-DNA hybridization values and their relationship to whole-genome sequence similarities. Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 57:81-91], some microorganisms expressing a DNA-DNA relatedness value of 70% or more (as described above) can be regarded as functional homologs according to some embodiments of the invention. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the reference genomic sequence is as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4. 
 As used herein, “sequence identity” or “identity” or grammatical equivalents as used herein in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences includes reference to the residues in the two sequences which are the same when aligned. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g. charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences which differ by such conservative substitutions are considered to have “sequence similarity” or “similarity”. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., according to the algorithm of Henikoff S and Henikoff J G. [Amino acid substitution matrices from protein blocks. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992, 89(22): 10915-9]. 
 Identity can be determined using any homology comparison software, including for example, the BlastN software of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) such as by using default parameters. 
 According to some embodiments of the invention, the identity is a global identity, i.e., an identity over the entire nucleic acid sequences of the invention and not over portions thereof. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the genomic nucleic acid sequence is at least about 70%, e.g., at least 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96% least about 97%, at least about 97.1%, at least about 97.2%, at least about 97.3%, at least about 97.4%, at least about 97.5%, at least about 97.6%, at least about 97.7%, at least about 97.8%, at least about 97.9%, at least about 98%, at least about 98.1%, at least about 98.2%, at least about 98.3%, at least about 98.4%, at least about 98.5%, at least about 98.6%, at least about 98.7%, at least about 98.8%, at least about 98.9%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.1%, at least about 99.2%, at least about 99.3%, at least about 99.4%, at least about 99.5%, at least about 99.6%, at least about 99.7%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.95% 99.95%, at least about 99.99%, at least about 99.999%, at least about 99.9999%, at least about 99.99999%, at least about 99.999999% or more to the genomic sequence of the deposited strain (SEQ ID NO: 4). 
 According to a specific embodiment, the genomic nucleic acid sequence is at least about 97%, at least about 97.1%, at least about 97.2%, at least about 97.3%, at least about 97.4%, at least about 97.5%, at least about 97.6%, at least about 97.7%, at least about 97.8%, at least about 97.9%, at least about 98%, at least about 98.1%, at least about 98.2%, at least about 98.3%, at least about 98.4%, at least about 98.5%, at least about 98.6%, at least about 98.7%, at least about 98.8%, at least about 98.9%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.1%, at least about 99.2%, at least about 99.3%, at least about 99.4%, at least about 99.5%, at least about 99.6%, at least about 99.7%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.9%, 99.95%, at least about 99.99%, at least about 99.999%, at least about 99.9999%, at least about 99.99999%, at least about 99.999999% or more identical to that of the deposited strain (SEQ ID NO: 4). 
 According to an additional or alternative embodiment, a functional homolog is determined as the average nucleotide identity (ANI), which detects the DNA conservation of the core genome (Konstantinidis K and Tiedje J M, 2005, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102: 2567-2592). In some embodiments, the ANI between the functional homolog and the deposited strain is of at least about 95%, at least about, 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.1%, at least about 99.5%, at least about 99.6%, at least about 99.7%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.99%, at least about 99.999%, at least about 99.9999%, at least about 99.99999%, at least about 99.999999% or more. 
 According to an additional or alternative embodiment, a functional homolog is determined by the degree of relatedness between the functional homolog and deposited strain determined as the Tetranucleotide Signature Frequency Correlation Coefficient, which is based on oligonucleotide frequencies (Bohlin J. et al. 2008, BMC Genomics, 9:104). In some embodiments, the Tetranucleotide Signature Frequency Correlation coefficient between the variant and the deposited strain is of about 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999, 0.999999, 0.999999 or more. 
 According to an additional or alternative embodiment, the degree of relatedness between the functional homolog and the deposited strain is determined as the degree of similarity obtained when analyzing the genomes of the parent and of the variant strain by Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using one or more restriction endonucleases. The degree of similarity obtained by PFGE can be measured by the Dice similarity coefficient. In some embodiments, the Dice similarity coefficient between the variant and the deposited strain is of at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.1%, at least about 99.5%, at least about 99.6%, at least about 99.7%, at least about 99.8%, at least about 99.9%, at least about 99.99%, at least about 99.999%, at least about 99.9999%, at least about 99.99999%, at least about 99.999999% or more. 
 According to an additional or alternative embodiment, the functional homolog is defined as having the same ribotype, as obtained using any of the methods known in the art and described, for instance, by Bouchet et al. (Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 2008, 21:262-273). 
 According to an additional or alternative embodiment, the degree of relatedness between the functional homolog and the deposited strain is determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient obtained by comparing the genetic profiles of both strains obtained by repetitive extragenic palindromic element-based PCR (REP-PCR) (see e.g. Chou and Wang, Int J Food Microbiol. 2006, 110:135-48). In some embodiments, the Pearson correlation coefficient obtained by comparing the REP-PCR profiles of the variant and the deposited strain is of at least about 0.99, at least about 0.999, at least about 0.9999, at least about 0.99999, at least about 0.999999, at least about 0.999999 or more. 
 According to an additional or alternative embodiment, the degree of relatedness between the functional homolog and the deposited strains is defined by the linkage distance obtained by comparing the genetic profiles of both strains obtained by Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (see e.g. Maiden, M. C., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:3140-3145).

 According to a specific embodiment, the composition, preparation, formulation, culture, article of manufacture is selected from the group consisting of a still culture, whole cultures stored stock of cells (particularly glycerol stocks), agar strip, stored agar plug in glycerol/water, freeze dried stock, and dried stocks such as lyophilisate dried onto filter paper. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the composition, preparation, culture or formulation is devoid of animal contaminants to render it safe for human use. 
 As used herein “a culture” refers to a fluid, pellet, scraping, dried sample, lyophilisate or a support, container, or medium such as a plate, paper, filter, matrix, straw, pipette or pipette tip, fiber, needle, gel, swab, tube, vial, particle, etc. that contains the deposited strain or the functional homolog thereof in an amount that exceeds that found in nature, as described hereinabove. In the present invention, an isolated culture of a microbial strain is a culture fluid or a scraping, pellet, dried composition, preparation, formulation, culture, article of manufacture, lyophilisate, or a support, container, or medium that contains the microorganism, in the absence of other organisms (or in combination with other microbes which were preselected and grown for the purpose of combined administration). 
 According to a specific embodiment, the bacterial strain within the composition, preparation, formulation, culture, article of manufacture is viable. 
 The bacterial strain can be produced or manufactured using methods which are well known in the art of microbiology. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the microbial strain is isolated from Doenjang, such as by using Luria Bertani Miller agar (BD, Difco) agar for plating. According to a specific embodiment, representative colonies are picked from plates with the highest dilution still showing colonies. After purification, the strain was stored at −80° C. The stock culture is propagated in LB Miller broth. 
 According to an aspect, the bacterial strain is cultured under conditions that allow propagation; after which (and/or during which) the bacterial strain is harvested. 
 Thus, according to some embodiments, cultures of the microbial strain may be prepared using standard static drying and liquid fermentation techniques known in the art. Growth is commonly effected in a bioreactor. 
 A bioreactor refers to any device or system that supports a biologically active environment. As described herein a bioreactor is a vessel in which microorganisms including the microorganism of the invention can be grown. A bioreactor may be any appropriate shape or size for growing the microorganisms. A bioreactor may range in size and scale from 10 mL (e.g., small scale) to liter's to cubic meters (e.g., large scale) and may be made of stainless steel, disposable material (e.g., nylon, plastic bags) or any other appropriate material as known and used in the art. The bioreactor may be a batch type bioreactor, a fed batch type or a continuous-type bioreactor (e.g., a continuous stirred reactor). For example, a bioreactor may be a chemostat as known and used in the art of microbiology for growing and harvesting microorganisms. A bioreactor may be obtained from any commercial supplier (See also Bioreactor System Design, Asenjo & Merchuk, CRC Press, 1995). 
 For small scale operations, a batch bioreactor may be used, for example, to test and develop new processes, and for processes that cannot be converted to continuous operations. 
 Microorganisms grown in a bioreactor may be suspended or immobilized. Growth in the bioreactor is generally under aerobic conditions at suitable temperatures and pH for growth. For the organisms of the invention, cell growth can be achieved at temperatures between 5-40° C., with an exemplary temperature range selected from 20 to 10° C., 15 to 28° C., 20 to 30° C., or 15 to 25° C. The pH of the nutrient medium can vary between 4.0 and 9.0. For example, the operating range can be usually slightly acidic to neutral at pH 5.0 to 8.5, or 4.5 to 6.5, or pH 5.0 to 6.0. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the cell growth is achieved at 20-40° C. at pH of 5.0-8.5. 
 Typically, maximal cell yield is obtained in 20-72 hours after inoculation. By virtue of the conditions applied in the selection process and general requirements of most microorganisms, a person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine essential nutrients and conditions. The microorganisms would typically be grown in aerobic liquid cultures on media which contain sources of carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic salts that can be assimilated by the microorganism and supportive of efficient cell growth. Exemplary carbon sources are hexoses such as glucose, but other sources that are readily assimilated such as amino acids, may be substituted. Many inorganic and proteinaceous materials may be used as nitrogen sources in the growth process. Exemplary nitrogen sources are amino acids and urea but others include gaseous ammonia, inorganic salts of nitrate and ammonium, vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, yeast extract, beef extract, proteose peptone, soybean meal, hydrolysates of casein, distiller's solubles, and the like. Among the inorganic minerals that can be incorporated into the nutrient medium are the customary salts capable of yielding calcium, zinc, iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, cobalt, potassium, sodium, molybdate, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, borate, and like ions. 
 The culture can be a pure culture, whereby a single microbial strain is included or a mixed culture. This is of course pending the compliance of the microbial strains to co-exist and proliferate under the same culturing conditions. When needed, an antibiotic or other growth-restricting conditions can be employed during culturing to restrict the growth of other microorganisms (contaminants) not desired in the culture/co-culture e.g., temperature, essential nutrients and the like. 
 According to an alternative or an additional embodiment, the desired combination is produced following culturing, such as when the microbial strains do not share the same or optimal culturing conditions. 
 The ratio of each type of microorganism in the final product will depend on the intended use (some are listed hereinbelow). 
 The identity of the microorganism(s) in the culture can be experimentally validated at the nucleic acid level, protein level, metabolite levels, functional level and/or by using classical microbiology tools, e.g., streaking (e.g., with selection). 
 After production, the microbial strain can be stored or used fresh, either as is or subject to further formulation. 
 Also contemplated herein are a lysate and/or a fermentation product of the above described methods. Methods of cell lysis of bacterial strains e.g., of the species  B. subtilis  are well known in the art. 
 The formulation of the microbial strain much depends on the intended use. Following is a non-limiting description of various formulations that can be used along with the present teachings. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the bacterial strain is formulated in a liquid formulation. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the bacterial strain is formulated in a dry formulation. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the bacterial strain is formulated in a gel formulation. 
 Microbial strains formulations used to reduce the incidence of pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria and/or fungi), can be in vivo administered, can be released into the air or in conjunction with an HVAC system, applied to waste, food products, food processing areas, food preparation tools, agricultural products, agricultural water (irrigation water, agricultural soils, agricultural crops) and the like. The formulations of bacteria described herein can be applied in a powder, liquid, foam, gelled, aerosol or solid form. In liquid formulations, the microbial strain formulations may be dispensed from conventional dispensing devices, including pump sprayers, aerosol containers, squirt bottles etc. For application over larger areas, hoses, sprinkler systems or other suitable devices may be used. In the alternative, the formulations can be applied as a dry powder such as lyophilized bacteria or using any of the techniques currently known to a person of skill in the art. The optimal frequency of applications of the microbial strain formulations may depend on the target on which the formulation is to be applied. In certain embodiments, wherein formulations are contemplated, a microorganism is harvested and concentrated using a method that does not markedly decrease the viable cell concentration through centrifugation or filtration. 
 In embodiments wherein formulations are contemplated for preservation, such preservation may include a process of freezing, freeze-drying and/or spray-drying. 
 In certain embodiments, the preserved cells can be used in a microbial-based product. The preserved bacterial strain can be provided “as-is” without further dilution or modification. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the bacterial strain can be mixed with a carrier to dilute the concentration of cells to an appropriate concentration for administration. The carrier can be as simple as one element, or a more complex molecule or mixture of molecules in any proportion in order to act as a suitable carrier. This carrier and composition may, in certain instances, have defined properties such as solubility in water or other media. The diluting carrier can be of any composition or combination including but not limited to: lactose, glucose, non-fat dry milk powder, oligosaccharides, glycerol, oil, lecithin, or other materials. 
 In particular formulations, other chemicals or materials may be used to reduce or absorb moisture and/or oxygen for further protection and preservation of the viable microbial cells. Such chemicals or materials include, but are not limited to: calcium stearate, sodium aluminosilicate, sodium sulfide, sodium carbonate, silica, iron oxides, calcium carbonate, zeolite, bicarbonates, sodium sulfate, silicon dioxide and other silica materials. 
 In certain embodiments, a microbial strain formulation for administration to a subject or a surface or other target can include a preservation matrix, which contains and preserves the culture. Such a matrix may include a biologically active binding agent, an antioxidant, a polyol, a carbohydrate and a proteinaceous material. 
 Antioxidants included in a preservation matrix may be provided to retard oxidative damage to the microbial cells during the preservation and storage process. 
 Polyols (i.e., polyhydric alcohols) included in a preservation matrix may be provided to maintain the native, uncollapsed state of cellular proteins and membranes during the preservation and storage process. In particular, polyols interact with the cell membrane and provide support during the dehydration portion of the preservation process. Examples of polyols include, but are not limited to xylitol, adonitol, glycerol, dulcitol, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol and/or arabitol. 
 Carbohydrates included in a preservation matrix may be provided to maintain the native, uncollapsed state of cellular proteins and membranes during the preservation and storage process. In particular, carbohydrates provide cell wall integrity during the dehydration portion of the preservation process. Exemplary carbohydrates include, but are not limited to dextrose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, fructose and/or any other monosaccharide, disaccharide or polysaccharide. 
 A proteinaceous material included in a preservation matrix may provide further protection of the microbial cell during the dehydration portion of the preservation process. Exemplary proteinaceous materials include, but are not limited to skim milk and albumin. 
 The microbial cells can be preserved within a preservation matrix including coating the cell matrix suspension onto an inert carrier e.g., a maltodextrin bead. The coated beads can then be dried, e.g., by a fluid bed drying method. Fluid bed drying methods are well known in the art. The coated beads can be stored as a powder, placed into gelatin capsules, or pressed into tablets. 
 In other formulations, the microbial strain contemplated can be formulated as a hard gelatin capsule. Gelatin capsules are commercially available and are well known in the art. In this embodiment, the method further comprises dispensing the cell suspension matrix to a gelatin capsule, chilling the gelatin capsule until the cell suspension matrix forms a non-fluid matrix and to affix the gel to the interior wall of the gelatin capsule, and desiccating the gelatin capsule in a desiccation chamber. Further examples of embodiments of preservation matrices and gelatin capsule formulations may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,526 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. 
 In certain applications, the microbial strain may be placed in a microencapsulation formulation. Such microencapsulation formulations may have applicability for example in administration to subjects via oral, nasal, rectal, vaginal or urethral routes. Spray drying is the most commonly used microencapsulation method in the food industry, is economical and flexible, and produces a good quality product. The process involves the dispersion of the core material into a polymer solution, forming an emulsion or dispersion, followed by homogenisation of the liquid, then atomisation of the mixture into the drying chamber. This leads to evaporation of the solvent (water) and hence the formation of matrix type microcapsules. 
 Examples of microencapsulation can be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,209 that is herein incorporated by reference. 
 An embodiment of preserving by freezing is to prepare frozen beads or pellets comprising the microbial strain. After a suitable fermentation, the liquid is removed from the viable bacteria by a method including but not limited to centrifugation, ultrafiltration, or sedimentation. An additive compound may be added to the bacteria prior to freezing. Suitable additives include but are not limited to, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, maltodextrin, cyclodextrin, spray gum, fish gelatin bloom, and maltitol. 
 Suitable additives may also serve as cryoprotective agents to improve the stability of the frozen culture. Cryoprotective agents include, but are not limited to, proteins, protein hydrosolates, carbohydrates, or a compound involved in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. U.S. Publ. Appl. 20070254353. Proteins or protein hydrolysates include but are not limited to, malt extract, milk powder, whey powder, yeast extract, gluten, collagen, gelatin, elastin, keratin, or albumin. Carbohydrates include but are not limited to pentoses (e.g. ribose, xylose), hexoses (e.g. fructose, mannose, sorbose), disaccharides (e.g. sucrose, trehalose, melibiose, lactulose), oligosaccharides (e.g. raffinose), oligofrutoses (e.g. actilight, fribroloses), polysaccharides (e.g. maltodextrins, xanthan gum, pectin, alginate, microcrystalline cellulose, dextran, PEG), and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, manitol). U.S. Publ. Appl. 20070254353. 
 A foam is defined herein is a composition that is formed by trapping many gas bubbles in a liquid. Methods pertaining to the formulation and administration of foams are set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,112,942, 5,652,194, 6,140,355, 6,258,374, and 6,558,043, each of which is herein specifically incorporated by reference in its entirety. 
 A typical foam formulation may, for example, be constructed by introducing a gas into a gel or aqueous pharmaceutical composition such that bubbles of the gas are within the pharmaceutical composition. 
 A microbial strain formulation can be applied to a surface or simply to the air using an electrostatic spray apparatus. This apparatus should have a chamber for containing the microbial strain formulation and an opening in fluid connection with the chamber through which the microbial strain formulation can be dispensed and deposited on a desired surface. The apparatus should allow for electrically charging the microbial strain formulation. For example, a conductor can be used to connect the chamber to a voltage power source. One of skill in the art would be aware of other suitable devices that can function as such a conductor. 
 To apply the formulation to a surface or to the air, the formulation is placed into the chamber of the electrostatic spray apparatus. The microbial strain formulation can be pumped into the chamber. When the microbial strain formulation is placed into the chamber, it contacts the conductor, such as a high-voltage DC electrode, and becomes charged. Once the formulation in the chamber is charged, it carries the same charge as the conductor. As a result the formulation and conductor repel each other. This repulsive force discharges the microbial strain formulation through the opening of the nozzle to create streams of droplets. Therefore, no additional gas source is required for atomization of the coating formulation. Accordingly, a cloud of highly charged, highly uniform-sized droplets can be formed. 
 Since the droplets that are formed carry a charge, when they are deposited on a grounded surface, they will be guided by their electrostatic attraction to the grounded and hence electrically neutral surface. Since the droplets carry the same electrical charge, they will repel each other. This repulsion causes the droplets arriving at the surface to avoid the areas where other droplets have already been deposited and instead land on areas of the surface that have not been coated. In this way, an inherently uniform coating is formed. 
 One example of a suitable nozzle apparatus that can be used in the method of some embodiments of the invention is an apparatus for electrohydrodynamic spray-coating that is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,749,125. This apparatus has a metal shim that is placed within the nozzle apparatus to define a plurality of nozzle openings. The metal shim is also connected to a voltage source that allows for the formation of electrically charged droplets of coating formulation. 
 Aerosol dispending system and automated embodiments thereof are further described hereinbelow. 
 Lyophilization—Dry microorganism cultures may be prepared according to methods which are well known in the art. In addition to constituents present in the culture medium, the medium may comprise at least one matrix material with or without other stabilizing substances. These materials may be selected from inorganic salts or buffers, at least one other compound which is selected from mono-, oligo- and polysaccharides, polyols, polyethers, amino acids, oligo- and polypeptides, milk-derived compounds, organic carboxylic acids, mineral compounds, organic carrier materials such as wheat semolina bran, alginates, DMSO, PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone), CMC (carboxymethylcellulose), alpha-tocopherol, beta.-carotene and mixtures thereof. 
 Examples of suitable saccharide carrier components are sucrose, fructose, maltose, dextrose, lactose and maltodextrin. An example of a suitable polyol is glycerol. Examples of suitable amino acids are glutamic acid, aspartic acid and the salts thereof. An example of a suitable peptide carrier is peptone. An example of a milk-derived compound is sweet whey powder. Suitable organic carboxylic acids are, for example, citric acid, malic acid and L-ascorbic acid. Examples of suitable mineral carriers are montmorillonite and palygorskite. 
 The microorganism suspension containing the carrier can be dried in various ways. Suitable drying processes are in principle freeze drying, fluidized-bed drying and, spray-drying. Spray-drying also comprises modified spray-drying processes, such as spray-agglomeration or agglomerating spray-drying. The latter process is also known under the name FSD (fluidized spray-dryer) process. 
 Freeze-drying for preparing dry microorganism cultures according to some embodiments of the present invention can be carried out, for example, on the basis of the freeze-drying process described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,897,307, the contents of which is incorporated completely by reference. 
 Another drying process contemplated for use according to some embodiments of the present invention is spray-drying. Those methods which can be used according to some embodiments of the present invention are essentially all spray-drying techniques known in the art. The material to be sprayed can, for example, be dried concurrently or countercurrently; spraying can be carried out by means of a single-component or multiple-component nozzle or by means of an atomizer wheel. 
 The drying process according to some embodiments of the present invention may be carried out in such a manner that a very low residual moisture content is present in the dry material. The percentage water content is typically from about 2 to 3% by weight. This may be achieved by adding a post-drying step subsequently to the spray-drying step. The drying material is, for example, post-dried in a fluidized bed, such as at a temperature in the range of from 15 to 50° C., for a period of, for example, from 15 minutes to 20 hours. Conditioned compressed air or conditioned nitrogen serves as drying gas. 
 Instead of the above-described physical post-drying processes, it is also conceivable to add specific desiccants to the dry material obtained from the spray-drying. Examples of suitable desiccants are inorganic salts, such as calcium chloride and sodium carbonate, organic polymers, such as the product obtainable under the trade name Kollidion 90 F, and silicon-dioxide-containing desiccants, such as silica gel, zeolites and desiccants which are obtainable under the trade name Tixosil 38, Sipernat 22 S or  Aerosil  200. 
 In certain embodiments, the microbial; strain may be refrigerated after harvesting and concentrating. In certain embodiments, after a suitable fermentation, the liquid is removed from the viable bacteria by a method including but not limited to centrifugation, ultrafiltration, or sedimentation. An additive compound may be added to the bacteria prior to refrigeration. Suitable additives include but are not limited to, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, maltodextrin, cyclodextrin, spray gum, fish gelatin bloom, and maltitol. 
 Suitable additives may also serve as cryoprotective agents to improve the stability of the refrigerated culture. Cryoprotective agents include, but are not limited to, proteins, protein hydrosolates, carbohydrates, or a compound involved in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. U.S. Publ. Appl. 20070254353. Proteins or protein hydrolysates include but are not limited to, malt extract, milk powder, whey powder, yeast extract, gluten, collagen, gelatin, elastin, keratin, or albumin. Carbohydrates include but are not limited to pentoses (e.g. ribose, xylose), hexoses (e.g. fructose, mannose, sorbose), disaccharides (e.g. sucrose, trehalose, melibiose, lactulose), oligosaccharides (e.g. raffinose), oligofrutoses (e.g. actilight, fribroloses), polysaccharides (e.g. maltodextrins, xanthan gum, pectin, alginate, microcrystalline cellulose, dextran, PEG), and sugar alcohols (sorbitol, manitol). U.S. Publ. Appl. 20070254353. 
 The type of formulation depends on the intended use. 
 It will be appreciated that the present inventors have identified for the first time certain activities of the bacterial strain  Bacillus subtilis . This bacterial strain was found effective and safe for use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. 
 As used herein, the term “treating” includes abrogating, substantially inhibiting, slowing or reversing the progression of a condition, substantially ameliorating clinical or other symptoms of a condition or substantially preventing the appearance of clinical or other symptoms of a condition. 
 As used herein “ Bacillus subtilis ” refers to a bacterial species in the genus  Bacillus . It is a gram positive soil bacteria closely related to the species  Bacillus subtilis . According to a specific embodiment strains of this bacterial species are as described herein, e.g.,    Bacillus subtilis   281 and functional homologs thereof. 
 According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling a population of pathogenic bacteria and/or fungi, the method comprising providing an effective amount of the isolated bacterial strain or functional homolog of same or the composition such as described herein, thereby controlling the population of pathogenic bacteria and/or fungi. 
 As used herein “controlling” refers to preventing or reducing microbial infections such as a bacterial or fungal infection or inhibiting the rate and extent of such infection. Therapeutic treatment is also contemplated. 
 According to a specific embodiment, the controlling is prevention of an infection. 
 As described hereinbelow, the present inventors identified the use of the bacterial strain as described herein in controlling various species of microbes. 
 Thus, according to some embodiments, the present compositions and methods are useful in controlling  E. coli.    
   Escherichia coli  is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus  Escherichia  that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. Some  E. coli  serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. It is most abundant in food and water supply and industrial sites (e.g., paper production). 
 According to some additional or alternative embodiments, the present compositions and methods are useful in controlling  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.    
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is a common Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. It is the most common cause of infections of burn injuries and of the outer ear (otitis externa), and is the most frequent colonizer of medical devices (e.g., catheters).  Pseudomonas  can be spread by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleaned or on the hands of healthcare workers.  Pseudomonas  can cause community-acquired pneumonias, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonias, being one of the most common agents isolated in several studies. One in ten hospital-acquired infections is from  Pseudomonas . Cystic fibrosis patients are also predisposed to  P. aeruginosa  infection of the lungs.  P. aeruginosa  may also be a common cause of “hot-tub rash” (dermatitis), caused by lack of proper, periodic attention to water quality. Since these bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, they can cause skin rash or swimmer's ear.  Pseudomonas  is also a common cause of postoperative infection in radial keratotomy surgery patients. The organism is also associated with the skin lesion ecthyma gangrenosum.  P. aeruginosa  is frequently associated with osteomyelitis involving puncture wounds of the foot, believed to result from direct inoculation with  P. aeruginosa  via the foam padding found in tennis shoes, with diabetic patients at a higher risk. 
 According to some additional or alternative embodiments, the present compositions and methods are useful in controlling  Bacillus cereus.    
   Bacillus cereus  is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, motile, beta hemolytic bacterium commonly found in soil and food. Some strains are harmful to humans and cause foodborne disease.  Bacillus  foodborne diseases occur due to survival of the bacterial endospores when food is improperly cooked. Cooking temperatures less than or equal to 100° C. (212° F.) allow some  B. cereus  spores to survive. This problem is compounded when food is then improperly refrigerated, allowing the endospores to germinate. 
 According to some additional or alternative embodiments, the present compositions and methods are useful in controlling  Salmonella typhimurium.    
   Salmonella typhimurium . is a serogroup of a rod-shaped, flagellated, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium and a member of the genus  Salmonella . It is a serovar that is a serious human pathogen. The encounter of humans to  S. typhimurium  is made via fecal-oral route from infected individuals or animals to healthy ones, with food as a common vector. Poor hygiene of patients shedding the organism can lead to secondary infection, as well as consumption of shellfish from polluted bodies of water. Most common source of infection, however, are food of animal origin and drinking water tainted by urine and feces of infected individuals and animals. 
 According to some additional or alternative embodiments, the present compositions and methods are useful in controlling  Alternaria alternata.    
   Alternaria alternata  is a fungus which has been recorded causing leaf spot and other diseases on over 380 host species of plant. It is an opportunistic pathogen on numerous hosts causing leaf spots, rots and blights on many plant parts. In order to survive,  Alternaria alternata  needs a moist warm environment. It is often found in areas with humid climates, or where there has been significant rainfall. The fungus lives in seeds and seedlings, and is also spread by spores. This disease flourishes in dead plants that have been left in gardens over winter. Additionally, when dead infected debris is added to compost pile it can spread to other vegetables throughout the garden. 
 According to some additional or alternative embodiments, the present compositions and methods are useful in controlling  Cladosporium sphaerospermum.    
   Cladosporium sphaerospermum  is a fungus belonging to the genus  Cladosporium. Cladosporium sphaerospermum  is mainly known as a spoilage agent of harvested fruits and vegetables.  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  is a cosmopolitan fungus that inhabits city buildings and the environment and because of its airborne nature it can move rapidly between locations.  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  is also been shown to inhabit paint films on walls and other surfaces as well as old paintings. This fungus is also able to grow on gypsum-based material with and without paint and wallpaper. Plant materials that are affected include citrus leaves on various other decaying plant leaves, on the stems of herbaceous and woody plants, on fruits and vegetables.

The verification may be based on input received from  reader   106 . In some example embodiments,  circuit   105  receives data from  reader   106  and compares the data received to information stored in memory. Optionally, if an identification code read by  reader   106  matches an identification code listed in the memory, verification may be established. The memory may be memory included in  circuit   105 , memory included in a  remote server   800  or memory included in a cloud. Optionally, the information needed to verify authentication of cartridges may be uploaded by a  remote server   800  and  circuit   105  may access the information based on wireless communication. According to some example embodiments,  circuit   105  is configured to terminate dispersion or formation of atomized liquid  125  and provide an alert when  cartridge   150  cannot be positively verified. 
   Reader   106  may be configured to scan a code or interrogate a  tag   160  positioned on  cartridge   150 , when  cartridge   150  is installed in  device   100  and provide the data to  circuit   105 . In some examples,  reader   106  is or includes a camera or a RFID scanner that is configured to detect data stored on  cartridge   150 . Preferably,  reader   106  is an active reader that is controlled and powered with  circuit   105 . In some example embodiments,  controller   105  activates  reader   106  at a defined frequency, e.g. every 5-60 minutes to scan or interrogate  tag   160 . Additionally or alternatively,  controller   105  may activate reader at defined events. For example,  controller   105  may activate reader when power of  device   100  is turned on and during installation of  cartridge   150  in the  device   100 . In some example embodiments communication between  reader   106  and  tag   160  is wireless or contactless. In other example embodiments, communication between  reader   106  and  tag   160  is based on electrical contact. 
 Optionally,  cartridge   150  configured for use with  device   100  includes tag or  code   160  with data to verify its compatibility.

Optionally, breaking of the seal alters data stored in tag or  code   160  so that the event may be recorded and detected by  reader   106 . Optionally, this information may be used to prevent  operating device   100  with cartridges that have been refilled.  Cartridge   150  may be in the form of a bottle or may be any container that can contain fluid  159  to be dispersed as an aerosol. Typically  cartridge   150  is configured to be replaced after its contents have been emptied. 
 In some example embodiments,  tag   160  may be an active tag and  reader   106  may transmit data to tag  160  that may be stored in  tag   160 . Active storage may be a microchip with RAM memory in which case a small power source may be included on  cartridge   150 . Alternatively, active storage may be an active RFID.

Circuit   105  may additionally or alternatively regulate activity of  device   500  based on inputs from one or more sensors in communication with  circuit   105 . In some example embodiment,  device   500  includes  sensors   128  configured to detect a parameter related to  content   159  in  cartridge   150 . Optionally,  sensor   128  is a level sensor for detecting a level of  liquid   159  in  cartridge   150 . Optionally, one  sensor   128  may be positioned to sense liquid at 1-3 cm from a bottom of  cartridge   150  to detect when contents of  cartridge   150  are nearly emptied. In some example embodiments, when contents of  cartridge   150  are nearly emptied,  circuit   105  may provide an alert on  display   103  and may also communicate this information to a  remote server   800  in communication with  circuit   105 .  Remote server   800  may then alert a service provider or deliver a new cartridge to the  site including device   500 . 
   Device   500  may additionally include  sensors   127  that may detect environmental conditions. Optionally, humidity is detected. In some example embodiments, temperature is detected. At times, an expiration date may be adjusted based on the detected environmental conditions. For example, an expiration date may be shortened in environments with higher humidity as compared to environments that are more arid. Optionally, frequency or duration of actuation may be adjusted based on output detected from one or more of  sensors   127 ,  sensors   128  and based on data read with  reader   106 . 
 In some example embodiments,  device   500  may be configured to receive input from a stand- alone sensor   126  that is remote from  device   500 . Input may be received based on tethered or wireless connection. Stand- alone sensor   126  may be for example an air quality probe similar to E4000 indoor air quality probe offered by NanoSense, France, a thermostat associated with an HVAC, or a humidity sensor. Input from  remote sensors   126  may similarly be used to adjust an expiration date or to adjust frequency or duration of actuation based on the detected environmental conditions. 
 According to some example embodiments, the  aerosol dispensing device   500  additionally includes safety verification functionality as described herein above to verify compatibility, authenticity and safety of  cartridge   150  when it is inserted into  device   500  and optionally to provide ongoing monitoring while  cartridge   150  is maintained in  device   500 . In some example embodiments, the safety verification functionality is based on  reader   106  reading data on a  tag   160  included on  cartridge   150  and  circuit   105  processing the data.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 Strains 
   Bacillus  strains were isolated from home-made Doenjang using Luria Bertani Miller agar (BD, Difco) agar for plating. Representative colonies were picked from plates with the highest dilution still showing colonies. After purification, the strains were stored at −80° C. Before each experiment, the stock culture was cultured in 10 ml LB Miller broth (BD, Difco) in 50 ml falcon sterile tubes for 18 hours at 37° C. in a shaking incubator (rotatory, 120 RPM), the tubes were located in a slope position at an angle of ca80° relative to the vertical line. Then 1% diluted to fresh media (and grown in the same conditions). The culture was then streaked on LB Miller agar (BD, Difco) and incubated for 18 hours. Representative colony was picked and cultured on LB Miller broth (BD, Difco) at 37° C. in a shaking incubator (rotatory, 120 RPM according to the time indicated at each test). Reference strains were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) and KACC (Korean Agricultural Culture Collection) and KCTC (Korea, Collection for Type Cultures). 
 16S rDNA Sequencing 
 Pure cultures of    Bacillus subtilis   281 were grown on LB Miller agar (BD Difco) at 37° C. for 24 hours. The plate was sent to Solgent Inc. (Deajun, South Korea) for bi-directional 16S rDNA sequencing using (5′-AGA GTT TGATCMTGG CTC AG-3′, SEQ ID NO: 1) and 1492R (5′-TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACTT-3′ SEQ ID NO: 2) primers by (Reysenbach, Giver et al. 1992). Bi-directional sequencing results were assembled using Codon Code Aligner (Codon Code Corporation, USA) and compared with reference sequences of  Bacillus  species on the GenBank database (www(dot)ncbidotnlmdotnih(dot)gov/Blastn/). 
 API Test 
 Specific sugar fermentation pattern was monitored using API 50CHB strips (Biomerieux). The  Bacillus  strain pellet was prepared using LB Miller agar (BD Difco) at 37° C. for 24 hours and centrifuged 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was suspended using the preparation media in the kit and applied on different sugars according to the instruction manual. 
 Hemolysis Test 
     Bacillus subtilis   281 was grown at 37° C. for 18 hours in LB broth and then streaked onto 5% sheep blood agar (Hanil Komed) and incubated for 24 h at 37° C. Alpha (α) hemolysis was considered as the partial decomposition of the hemoglobin of the red blood cells, beta (β) hemolysis as the complete breakdown of the hemoglobin of the red blood cells observed as a clear zone in the agar plate and gamma (γ) hemolysis as the lack of hemolysis.  B. cereus  ATCC 27348 was used as a positive control. 
 Lecithinase Test 
   Bacillus subtilis  2818 and  B. cereus  ATCC 27348 (positive control) were grown at 37° C. for 18 hours in LB Miller broth and streaked out onto egg yolk agar. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37° C. and the formation of a white precipitate around the colonies was considered as positive for lecithinase activity (Hong, Huang et al. 2008, Sorokulova, Pinchuk et al. 2008). 
 Antibiotic Resistance Test 
 The basic protocol was followed by CLSI recommendation (Jorgensen and Turnidge 2015). Pure cultures of    Bacillus subtilis   281 were cultivated at 37° C. for 18 hours in LB Miller agar. The agar dilution method was used to assess the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotics against the strain. A single colony was resuspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 1× and adjusted to 0.01 optical density (OD). Ten microliters (1×10 5  CFU/mL) of strain were inoculated on the plates using multipin-inoculator and incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. The strain was considered susceptible when they were inhibited at a concentration for a specific antimicrobial equal or lower than the established cut-off value and resistant bacterial strain when it was not inhibited at a concentration of a specific antimicrobial higher than the established cut-off value according to the parameters established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). 
 Inhalation Infection Test 
 The animal study was approved by Handong Global University Ethical committee. For the experiment, 40 mice were divided into four groups comprising negative control, two positive controls infected with pathogenic microorganisms of  Streptococcus pneumoniae  ATCC49619 and  Bacillus cereus  ATCC27348 and one group infected with the tested microorganism. Potential  probiotic  Bacillus subtilis       281 was infected at a dose of 1×10 7  CFU/mouse with pre-treatment of cyclophosphamide to induce immunocompromised status. The cyclophosphamide was used to derive an immunocompromised animal model in order to monitor more pronounced influence of the infected microorganism as a so called worst case scenario (Kong, Hellermann et al. 2005). 
 The    Bacillus subtilis   281 was grown for 18 hours in LB Miller broth (BD Difco) at 37° C. while  S. pneumoniae  ATCC49619 was cultured on 5% Sheep blood agar and sub-cultured in Brain Heart Infusion broth (BD Difco) and incubated at 37° C. The bacterial solution was diluted using 1×PBS to 1×10 7  CFU/mouse. The inoculum concentration was determined by enumeration of cultured bacteria on agar plates. 
 The animal lung infection model was carried out in 4-week-old female ICR mice (Hyo-chang science). The mice were anesthetized during respiratory infection using 50 μL of bacterial suspension through the intranasal route. After 24 h post infection, 2 mice of each group were selected randomly and sacrificed with diethyl ether for enumeration of viable colonies in lungs. Lungs were extracted and homogenized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Before homogenization, lungs were monitored visually. The homogenized lung samples were diluted and spread on 5% Sheep blood agar to enumerate number of pathogens in the lungs. The plates were incubated for 18 h. The rest of mice were monitored during 1 week to measure their survival rates (Ginsberg, Moldawer et al. 1991). 
 Efficacy Tests 
 The agar well diffusion assay was performed to evaluate the antagonistic activity of    B. subtilis   281 against the growth of pathogenic bacteria including  Escherichia coli  ATCC 25922 , Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ATCC 27853 , B. cereus  ATCC 27348 , Staphylococcus aureus  ATCC 6538 ,  Salmonella typhimurium      ATCC  14028 and  Listeria innocua  ATCC 33090. The antagonistic activity of    B. subtilis   281 was also verified against molds such as  Alternaria alternata  (Fries) Keissler (ATCC® MYA-4642™),  Cladosporium sphaerospermum  Penzig (ATCC® MYA-4645™) and  Penicillium chrysogenum  Thom (ATCC® MYA-4644™). Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) Agar was used for the antagonism against pathogenic microorganisms while the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was used for evaluation against molds. Reference pathogens were prepared using BHI broth 37° C. for 18 h while    B. subtilis   281 was grown using LB broth at 37° C. for 18 h. Molds were prepared using PDA at 25° C. with 85% HR for 7 days. Mold spores, pathogens and    B. subtilis   281 were harvested and resuspended in PBS. Pathogens and    B. subtilis   281 was adjusted at optical density of 0.2 and 100 μL of pathogen suspended in PBS was spread on BHI agar plates. The same amount of mold spore suspension was inoculated on PDA. Wells were made in all the plates and 20 μL of    B. subtilis   281 suspensions were inoculated in the holes while the BHI plates were incubated at 37° C. for 24 h and PDA plates at 25° C. for 72 h. The inhibition of pathogens and molds were observed as a clear zone around the  bacillus  strain inoculated wells and 10% hydrogen peroxide served as a positive control. 
 Complete Genome Sequence 
 The complete genome sequence of    B. subtilis   281 was generated using the PacBio RS platform with single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing at Theragenetex (Seoul, South Korea). Annotations were performed by merging the results obtained from the Rapid Annotations were performed by merging the results obtained from the Papid Annotaions using Subsystems Technology (RAST) server, Glimmer 3.02 modeling software, tRNAscan-SE 2.0, and RNAmmer 1.2. In addition, the contigs were searched against the KEGG, UniProt, and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) databases to annotate the gene description. 
 Metabolite Analysis 
 Total protein was extracted from growth media of    B. subtilis   281 after 18 h at 37° C. incubation to evaluate the metabolites of    B. subtilis   281. Stock solution was prepared by dissolving 500 g of Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) into 350 mL of distilled water. 1 volume of TCA stock solution was added to 4 volume of    B. subtilis   281 growth media and incubated at 4° C. for 10 min. Tube was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and supernatant was removed to concentrate protein pellet. The pellet was washed with 200 μL of cold acetone and again concentrated by 14,000 rpm centrifugation for 5 min. This step was repeated for three times and the pellet was sent to be analyzed using LC-LTQ-Orbitrap at Technopark Biocenter (Pohang, South Korea). The raw data was analyzed using UniProt database to match predicted proteins from the growth media of    B. subtilis   281.
