 Below experiment describes the optimization of the inventive method.Analyze three factors: the final bacterial concentration (scope is from 0.05 to 0.85) in (i) inoculum, (ii) object construct (COI) is to the ratio of reticent suppressor SoS, i.e. COI:SoS (scope is from 3.00 to 0.33); (iii) and express in use tobacco bred (Nicotiana tabacum Burley21, PM132 and PM204).The TurboGFP expression level in the leaf infiltrated is measured in latter 6 days of infiltration (DPI).For total 48 test, it is sequential central composite design that this experiment use has that 4 central positions (OD600=0.45, ratio COI:SoS=1.67:1) and 3 times repeat.In contrast, three that under the compartment identical with infiltrating plant and condition, cultivate each kind do not infiltrate plant. 
 Prepared by inoculum 
 By carry reporter gene tGFP (A91) expression cassette as COI and carry the two kind Agrobacterium culture of reticent suppressor HcPro (A120) as the AGL1 of SoS in " without the animal component " LBMiller (10g/LNaCl+10g/L vegetalitas Tryptones+5g/L yeast extract) being supplemented with Pyocianil and kantlex cultivation to final optical density (OD600) 2.0.As described above, bacterium is resuspended in is infiltrated in solution by harvested by centrifugation.On infiltration same day, the concentrated inoculum of A91 and A120 mixed with three kinds of different ratio 3:1,1.67:1 and 1:3, and to be diluted to final OD600 be separately 0.85 in infiltration solution.By three kinds of inoculums balance to room temperature 30 minutes.In infiltration solution, OD600=0.45 and 0.05 is diluted to further subsequently, so that assessment uses the impact of lower bacterial density at three kinds of inoculums of OD600=0.85. 
 Agroinfiltration and biomass results 
 As described in example 1 above, tobacco plant is infiltrated, incubation gathering in the crops.As described in example 3 above, the extraction of tGFP is carried out with quantitative.By the extract do not infiltrated that 1:50 in the TurboGFP reference protein (Evrogen) to Extraction buffer of interpolation concentration range 4000 to 125ng/ml finally dilutes, preparation standard curve. 
 Result 
 In order to determine whether Agrobacterium OD600 and COI:SoS affects the tGFP expression level in Nicotiana tabacum kind, wherein change the experiment of limited group of two kinds of factors simultaneously.The tobacco plant OD600 of kind Burley21, PM132 and PM204 is 0.85,0.45 and 0.05 and A91 and A120 that COI:SoS ratio is 3.00,1.67 and 0.33 infiltrates.As from earlier experiments expection, in three tobacco breds of test, observe Stress responses for agroinfiltration as leaf yellow at 6DPI.Symptom increases with the bacterial density in inoculum and increases.Kind Burley21 even shows more obvious leaf yellow in least density.Little necrotic lesions is visible on the leaf of PM132 and PM204 infiltrated with the inoculum of OD600=0.85, but is mostly limited to leaf base.Stress symptom does not mainly observe the obvious impact of COI:SoS ratio owing to inoculum density. 
 Next, use whole three reliable regression models of tobacco bred to be inserted in lab space inside in being expressed by tGFP.Result display statistics is correlated with.Although the symptom of observing, the fluorescence measurement of TurboGFP is quantitatively presented at does not have negative correlation between the plant stress response of cumulative optical density(OD) and the expression level of institute's test specification inside.The tGFP level that the leaf of strong yellow or even necrotic lesions is still higher than low OD performance is shown when high OD.For whole three tobacco breds, similar for inoculum density with the reaction of the prediction of COI:SoS ratio, and for whole three kinds of maximum expression, can high Agrobacterium optical density(OD) in inoculum and high COI:SoS ratio time realize (Fig. 5), thus confirm this two kinds of instantaneous expression of recombinant proteins of factors influence.Most high expression level (Fig. 5 B and C) is observed to PM132 and PM204. 
 Each optimum parameter identified for three kinds is: for Burley21, OD600=0.69; COI:SoS=2.40; For PM132, OD600=0.7428; COI:SoS=2.8058; With for PM204, OD600=0.6729; COI:SoS=2.0805.These parameters produce 215,698 and the freezing weight of 603mgtGFP/kg respectively.But the prediction optimum value of PM132 is almost being (Fig. 5 B) outside the condition of this experimental selection.Therefore, the inoculum final OD of use range from 0.6 to 1.2
         600 with scope from the COI:SoS ratio of 2.0 to 4.5, carry out second time experiment.In this case, this model circulation ratio is low, means to there is huge pure error, with strong noise, but, there is stable state (plateau) near the optimum value showing prediction in first time experiment.
       
 Use when having the more possible horizontal average pair of the ANOVA of generalized linear model program, best model comprises interaction and this test shows, the tGFP expression level in PM132 be significantly higher than in Burley21 and PM204 those. 
 Before optimization, standard conditions used are OD
         600 =0.32 and COI:SoS ratio=1.00.By increasing agrobatcerium cell concentration in inoculum and object construct to the ratio of reticent suppressor, achieve the expression of recombinant proteins that 2.0-2.5 is doubly higher.
       
   embodiment 12 : improve be used for Agrobacterium transient expression inoculum goods can amplification.
       
 Vegetable material 
 By Nicotiana tabacum plant Burley21, PM132 and PM204 of conventional batch with 35 plant/m
         2 cultivate in mineral wool block in greenhouse compartment A, 20 h light times 26 DEG C/20 DEG C of daylight temperature/nocturnal temperatures and 70%/50% daytime/night relative humidity.By sub-irrigation, fertilizer irrigation is carried out to plant.
       
 Prepared by Agrobacterium inoculation thing 
 The Agrobacterium culture carrying the AGL1 bacterial strain of reporter gene tGFP (A91) expression cassette or reticent suppressor HcPro (A120) is cultivated to final OD in " without the animal component " LBMiller (10g/LNaCl+10g/L vegetalitas Tryptones+5g/L yeast extract) being supplemented with Pyocianil and kantlex
         600 >2.0 (if not illustrating in addition).Depend on the condition of test as described below, bacterium is resuspended in is infiltrated in solution to OD by harvested by centrifugation
         600 >2.0, or bacterium is kept in the medium to produce concentrated inoculum.Infiltrating the same day, the concentrated inoculum of A91 and A120 is mixed with ratio 1:1, and be diluted to final OD in infiltration solution
         600 be 0.32, and balance 30 minutes to room temperature.
       
 Agroinfiltration and biomass results 
 As described in example 1 above, tobacco plant is infiltrated, incubation gathering in the crops.As described in example 3 above, the extraction of tGFP is carried out with quantitative.By the extract do not infiltrated that 1:50 in the TurboGFP reference protein (Evrogen) to Extraction buffer of interpolation concentration range 4000 to 125ng/ml finally dilutes, preparation standard curve. 
 The mensuration of dissolubility total protein content 
 Use Coomassie-Plus analytical reagent (Pierce), by Microplate readout instrument measures absorbancy at 595nm, measure total soluble protein (TSP) content in leaf extract.By extract 1:20 dilution in ultrapure water, 10 μ L are carried on flat-bottom microplates in triplicate. 
 Result 
 First, study by infiltrating in solution the possibility of directly diluting Agrobacterium culture and preparing final inoculum.As shown in Figure 6, the transient expression of tGFP in tobacco Burley21, PM132 and PM204 of infiltrating does not affect by the omission of centrifugation step.In addition, significantly higher tGFP is even caused to express with PM132 and the PM204 plant that the inoculum directly prepared from liquid culture infiltrates.Notably, all similar under two conditions of the expression level in PM132 and PM204, therefore, only carries out further experiment with PM132. 
 Centrifugal and non-nutritive infiltrate resuspended in solution after, usually by inoculum 4 DEG C of storages at the most by 6 days, and transfection efficiency and transient expression level are without any noticeable change.But, omit centrifugal and resuspended step and propose holding conditions and storage time length issue.Usual supposition, the agrobatcerium cell stored in LB substratum is stayed in nutritious environment substantially, and this environment may continue promote bacterial growth and therefore cause culture to be degraded.In the next step, the package stability of the inoculum that test is not centrifugal.By OD
         600 the A91 (tGFP) of >2.0 and the dilution before 4 DEG C are stored 5 to 0 and next-door neighbour infiltrates of the concentrated culture of A120 (SoS).Use from the inoculum prepared by centrifugal culture as positive control.In the quantitative display of infiltration latter 6 days tGFP levels, not centrifugal inoculum stablizes 5 at 4 DEG C, and compared with the storage inoculum of 1 day, expression efficiency is not any change.Surprisingly, time compared with the culture stored, the use preparing inoculum from fresh culture thing causes tGFP expression less, and this shows for induction Agrobacterium virulence and best transfection, needs 4 DEG C of short period of time storages.These results also confirm not centrifugal inoculum in generation higher level recombinant protein than centrifugal inoculum residence and more efficient surprisingly.
       
 Bacterium to grow with 4 continuous periods for feature in liquid culture: lag phase, logarithmic phase, stationary phase and decline phase.During logarithmic phase, bacterial metabolism is active and growth is until they reach stationary phase fast, and one or more nutrient depletion wherein in substratum also limit further growth.For successful conversion, usually logarithm in early days to mid-log phase collect bacterium.Implement object and be the trial test determining agrobacterium strains AGL1 growth curve.Data presentation logarithmic phase before entering stationary phase at OD
         600 =0.3 and OD
         600 occur between=3.8-4.0.Required culture volume during in order to reduce preparation final inoculum, whether the use testing the culture cultivated at late log phase (namely with higher density) may affect the expression level in tobacco.The following inoculum of PM132 tobacco plant infiltrates, and described inoculum is from cultivation to usual OD
         600 2.0 or be cultured to OD
         600 3.8 culture preparations are also directly diluted in infiltration solution.Notably, analyze tGFP level latter 6 days of infiltration, display transient expression is by the impact using the Agrobacterium culture being in logarithmic phase late period to prepare inoculum.
       
 In a word, these data show when preparing inoculum, be in high-cell density (arrive OD at the most by use
         600 =3.8) culture and by omitting centrifugal and resuspended step, can the amplification prepared for the inoculum of agriculture bacillus mediated tobacco instantaneous conversion of convenience greatly, and does not affect instantaneous expression of recombinant proteins.
       
   embodiment 13 : increase expression of recombinant proteins by the tobacco plant infiltrated with inverted position incubation
       
 The present embodiment describes and finds surprisingly: the tobacco plant infiltrated with inverted position incubation causes the expression of recombinant proteins increased.When finding solution for following problem, obtaining this and finding: the tobacco plant of infiltration, especially in greenhouse with high-density incubation time, tend to lodging, because it can not support the weight infiltrating leaf.The solution provided is that the plant of infiltration is put upside down incubation.Notably, compared with the tobacco plant by normal upright position incubation, the remarkable increase that the infiltration plant that incubation reverses causes recombinant protein to be produced. 
 The tobacco plant cell vacuum immersion of agrobacterium strains AGL1, described cell carries the plasmid pC91 comprising tGFP expression cassette or the pC71 comprising H5 expression cassette, as described above.Whole tobacco plant also moistens by the pC120 total immersion can expressing HcPro gene silencing suppressor that comprises as described above. 
 Plant and infiltration 
 That cultivate in rock wool and be highly about 28cm 5 to 6 age in week Nicotiana tabacum PM132 plant use the cell vacuum immersion of agrobacterium strains AGL1 as previously mentioned, described cell carries the plasmid pC91 comprising tGFP expression cassette or the pC71 comprising H5 expression cassette.Whole tobacco plant also moistens by the pC120 total immersion can expressing HcPro gene silencing suppressor that comprises as described above. 
 After infiltration, immediately the plant of infiltration is put upside down incubation, the position simultaneously from greenhouse above plant provides illumination.In infiltration latter 4 to 6, gather in the crops 4 plant from each treatment group and use each plant three leaf dishes to express to measure tGFP.Leaf dish is freezing and grind to form fine powder in 2ml Eppendorf tube under liquid nitrogen, and carry out the extraction of tGFP as described above.In order to tGFP express quantitative, 5 μ L are often planted extract be diluted to 200 μ L and fluorescence as described in measurement.Prepare three repetitions. 
 Result 
 Plant does not show water stress symptom.Put upside down by plant after hanging a few days, the stem of plant, to shining the bendingof light of coming from higher position, top, forms hook spline structure.From Fig. 7, can see, compared with the plant of the normal processing of cultivating according to erect position, for the plant of inverted position (that is, putting upside down) incubation, tGFP expresses and fluorescence mean height twice (Fig. 7). 
   embodiment 14 : the expression being strengthened tGFP and H5 by the stand density increasing tobacco plant before infiltrating
       
 Present embodiment describes and cultivate tobacco plant to the surprising impact of tGFP with restructuring H5 expression with high-density before infiltrating.This tests display, under normal upright condition during incubation, relative to the plant cultivated with lower density, based on the weight of biomass infiltrated, produce about 40% more tGFP and 70% when two tobacco bred PM132 and PM217 cultivated with high-density before infiltrating significantly and more to recombinate H5. 
 Plant and infiltration 
 In order to study the impact of cultivating tobacco with different plant density, by Nicotiana tabacum PM132 and PM217 plant with two density: every square metre of 25 and 100 plant cultivatings.At after planting 46 days, as mentioned before, plant is infiltrated with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 comprising pC120 separately with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 comprising pC91 or pC71 simultaneously, the wherein said pC91 that contains contains tGFP expression cassette, described pC71 contains H5 expression cassette, and described pC120 contains HcPro gene silencing suppressor.Infiltrate final OD used
         600 0.32.For the plant cultivated with two kinds of density, at the average plant height of the pre-test of infiltration, hole diameter, chlorophyll content, leaf thickness and water content.As seen from table 3, the plant cultivated with high-density is comparatively large, have less chlorophyll and thinner leaf, but hole diameter is identical.For PM132, the water content of the plant cultivated with low density or high-density is identical, but for PM217, when cultivating with low density, water content is much lower.After infiltration, by half erect plants or reversing (putting upside down) incubation.Measure the individual plant of each process total nine (9), every 3 plant are repeated for three times.
       
 Result 
 Infiltrate latter 5 days results leaves, prepare extract and as described above, carry out the analysis of tGFP expression.Extract 1:1 to be diluted in GFP damping fluid and 5 μ L and 200 μ LGFP damping fluids are mixed for fluorescent quantitation.Quantitatively to be recombinated by ELISA the expression of H5.Summarized results in table 4. 
 As seen from table 4, for two kinds, during with normal upright position incubation, time compared with the plant cultivated with low density, before infiltration in high-density cultivate plant with the tGFP of mg/kg fresh weight Leaf biomass express mean height 41%.For H5, obtain analog result, wherein cultivate with low density and after infiltration with compared with the plant of normal upright position incubation time, on average express between increase 21-40% when described H5 display is cultivated with high-density.For the impact that research reversing incubation is expressed tGFP and H5, after infiltration, by the infiltration plant of half with inverted position incubation.As seen from table 4, for the plant cultivated with inverted position incubation and with low density, the remarkable increase that there is tGFP and H5 is expressed, but for planting of cultivating with high-density before infiltration, expresses and increase much less.For the PM132 plant cultivated by inverted position with low density, this causes tGFP to increase by 40% and H5 increase by 71%.For infiltrate before with high-density cultivate plant, compared with the plant by normal upright position incubation, this increase is only 3% for tGFP and is only 7% for H5.Establish total soluble protein (TSP) and estimate the expression of tGFP and H5 relative to TSP.For with high-density cultivate and with the plant of inverted position incubation, the expression of tGFP and H5 is always higher.In erect position, the plant cultivated with low density has the tGFP expression increase of about 10.5%.For the plant cultivated with high-density, this increase is about 13.6%.With regard to H5, for infiltrate before with erect position incubation and with low density cultivate plant, output increase is 0.25%, and for the plant cultivated with high-density, output increase is 0.37%.With regard to tGFP and H5, causing expressing with inverted position incubation increases (as the per-cent by TSP is measured).For the plant cultivated with low density, biomass is caused to increase 40-60% with inverted position incubation.For the plant cultivated with high-density, cause increase by 20% with inverted position incubation.With regard to tGFP, most high protein productive rate is 16.2% and cultivated with high-density before infiltration plant and obtain with during inverted position incubation.This expression is with regard to %TSP, and cultivate with by low density and compare with (TSP of 10.5%) compared with the plant of normal upright position incubation, protein yields increases by 54%. 
 In order to evaluate the only no expression that may cause increase of the minimizing on the surface of the leaf arriving at plant (it is by high-density cultivation and with inverted position incubation), the plant that incubation infiltrates with tGFP expression vector under complete darkness.Notably, the incubation of data presentation under complete darkness impairs tGFP expression.As seen from Figure 18, compared with the plant cultivated under illumination, under dark, the plant of incubation on average produces the tGFP of low 45%. 
 Carry out extra experiment to study three kinds of more Seedling height density: 122,529 and 961 plant/m
         2 on the impact of biomass production in PM132.This experiment repeats to implement with 5 times with randomized complete-block design.Growth matrix is the mineral wool block of 30cmx30cmx7cm, and manufactures wooden dibbler according to plant spacing.Dibbler is pressed into mineral wool block to produce the dark little depression of about 5mm.Transplant manual for seedling in mineral wool block.The whole area 30cmx30cm of mineral wool block contains through interval to realize the plant of desired density, but when infiltrating, only infiltrates the plant being positioned at 15cmx15cm middle section.This behavior allows to form border, to eliminate any side effect around middle section.Before infiltration, press from both sides out and discard border plant.The plant being in two etap, plant height is 25cm and 35cm is infiltrated.By the plant that infiltrates in greenhouse with normal or inverted position incubation 5 days.
       
 Prepare inoculum as described above, difference is, the ratio of AGL1 culture to the AGL1 culture carrying HcPro carrying TurboGFP expression cassette is 3:1 and final OD600 is 0.8.Infiltrated under 50 millibars of pressure by plant, described pressure reaches in 45 seconds at 1 point and discharged rapidly in 1.5 seconds. 
 Infiltrate latter 5 days, carry out total biomass, leaf and stem fresh weight, leaf thickness and other biological measurement amount.By the whole plant material comprising stem quick freezing be stored in-80C in dry ice. 
 With 122,529 and 961 plant/m
         2 the feature of the biomass of the tobacco plant of plantation shows, within the scope of these plant spacings, does not observe the significant difference of average plant height, % Leaf biomass and leaf thickness.But along with density increases, individual Plant weight exists decline, be also even like this during % Leaf biomass maintenance relative constancy.Be 529 plant/m at two time points in density
         2 time observe per unit growth area biomass increase.When plant be in 35cm to 45cm height and with 529 plant/m
         2 when infiltrating plant during plantation, obtain about 5kg leaf fresh weight/m
         2 or 10kg total biomass/m
         2 maximum yield.The biomass being multiplied by every square metre by the TurboGFP concentration in biomass calculates output, obtains the TurboGFP output of per unit area.With density 529 plant/m
         2 the highest TurboGFP obtaining per unit area produces output.Plant spacing is increased to 961 plant/m further
         2 to the generation of recombinant protein, there is disadvantageous effect.
       
   embodiment 15 : by infiltrate after under short day condition incubation strengthen expression of recombinant proteins
       
 Present embodiment describes the result of the wherein tobacco plant experiment of incubation under short day (h light every day 8) and long day (20 h light every day) condition after infiltration.This experiment display is for the plant of normal upright position and reversed position incubation, and when plant is after infiltration under short day condition during incubation, the expression of tGFP strengthens greatly. 
 Plant and infiltration 
 Nicotiana tabacum PM132 plant is cultivated with the density of every square metre of 75 plant.42 age in days plant ratio 1:1 and final OD
         600 the mixture containing two kinds of agrobacterium tumefaciens AGL1 bacterial strains of pC91 (tGFP binary expression vector) and pC120 (HcPro gene silencing suppressor binary expression vector) of=0.32 infiltrates.Plant mean height 43.4cm and there are average pore degree of leading 559.6 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 , show that enough stomatal opening are for absorbing inoculum (table 5).After infiltration, plant is by two kinds of different light circulation incubations: every day 8 h light or every day 20 h light.Half plant in often kind of photo-irradiation treatment is placed in normal upright position and second half is placed in inverted position.Altogether, 4 kinds of process are carried out.Results plant on the 0th, 3,5,7 and 9 after infiltration.For each measurement, often kind of process results 4 plant and each plant obtains 3 leaf dishes for tGFP expression analysis.Quantitative for tGFP, as previously mentioned, leaf dish is ground in 1mlGFP damping fluid and 5 μ L extracts and 200 μ LGFP damping fluids are mixed for fluorescent quantitation.
       
 Quantitative (mgtGFP/kg fresh weight biomass) that tGFP after result infiltrates two kinds under illumination solution expresses disclose the obvious impact (Fig. 8) that illumination is produced recombinant protein.No matter what kind of (upright or reversing) position of plant is, under short day condition, the plant of incubation all produces the tGFP of significantly more a large amount, as seen from Fig. 8.After infiltration the 7th day, compared with the plant of incubation under 20 h light after infiltrating, with in the plant of 8 h light incubations, the amount of the expression of tGFP doubled. 
 After infiltration the 7th day, under the tGFP expression ratio 20 h light scheme in the upright plant under 8 h light schemes incubation similar plant in tGFP express high by 104%.For the plant of putting upside down incubation, this trend is similar, and the plant under 8 h light produces the tGFP than the plant many 50% of incubation under 20 h light schemes.Also the tGFP in the plant cultivated under strengthening two kinds of illumination solution (8 h light and 20 h light) with inverted position incubation expresses.Compared with 8 h light process, under 20 h light significantly and can be increased to the 857.5mgtGFP/kg fresh biomass of reversed position by the plant of 8 h light incubations from the 371.2mgtGFP/kg fresh biomass of the plant cultivated with normal upright position and 20 h light, this represents recombinant protein and produces increase by 130% in the expression strengthened. 
   embodiment 16 : the plant optimized by Agrobacterium infiltrates
       
 Present embodiment describes the result of the experiment of the tobacco plant stomatal aperture before wherein research infiltrates.This result shows that tobacco plant should be exposed to light, thus stomatal conductance is in as tobacco plant in the scope of the feature of abundant grown under lighting conditions before infiltration.Tobacco plant is with about 9 plant/m
         2 density cultivate, to avoid any competition to illumination and space.Every day, monitoring experiment device was to guarantee homogeneous and stable growing environment.Irrigate solution to there are 2.4 conductivity values (E.C) and equal the nitrogen content of 206mg/L, to guarantee sufficient nutrient supply.Adjustment is needed to water scheme according to plant, to avoid by water excessively or deficiency causes anyly coerces.
       
 The 39 age in days Nicotiana tabacum plant of two kind PM132 and PM15 transform with the Agrobacterium (Agl1) of the expression cassette (pC91) containing coding TurboGFP, and described Agrobacterium combines with the Agrobacterium (Agl1) of expressing Hc-Pro as described above.The expression of GFP drives by minimum CaMV35Splus promotor and cowpea mosaic virus (HT-CPMV) 5'UTR, and the expression of HC-Pro is by dual CaMV35S promoters driven.For single construct process (GFP or reticent suppressor (SoS)), the bacterial concentration infiltrated in mixture remains on 0.16, and for two construct process (GFP+SoS), remains on 0.32.Standard of following infiltrates operation scheme, and plant is infiltrated 1 minute at 50 millibars. 
 Before infiltration, half plant is placed in indoor, dark space, and second half is placed in the having in the compartment of natural illumination of supplementary artificial lighting.This period, use steady state porometer SC-1 (DecagonDevices, USA) measurement and record of stomatal degree of leading.Measure in three continuous leaves fully expanded at position 4,5 and 6 (wherein 1 is the first leaf at bud place, top perpendicular to stem) place.The water content of growth matrix (rock wool) is measured with WET-2 sensor (Delta-Tdevices, USA). 
 For two tobacco breds, stomatal conductance difference is highly significant between photo-irradiation treatment and dark processing.What be held in the plant display under illumination leads 4 to 8 times that lead angle value that angle value is the plant be held under dark: the PM132 plant under illumination shows 260.6 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 mean value, and under dark, show 70.4 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 mean value.Similarly, the PM15 plant under illumination shows 440.1 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 mean value, and under dark, show 53.6 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 mean value.These results show can by giving the stomatal aperture in the quantity of illumination conditioning tobacco of plant: under good illumination condition, incubation plant promotes stomatal opening, reduces the quantity of illumination and reduce stomatal aperture (lower stomatal conductance) significantly.It is also worth noting that, also observe the difference of stomatal conductance between tobacco bred, PM15 shows the stomatal conductance of higher than PM132 1.7 times when illumination.Therefore, preferably before infiltration, PM132 stomatal conductance is in and is greater than about 70 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 , be greater than 100 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 , be greater than 150 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 , be greater than 200 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 , be greater than 250 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 , or be greater than 300 μm of olm
         -2 s
         -1 scope in.
       
 By the leaf freezing and grind into powder in dry ice infiltrated.Extract GFP and measure fluorescence.For two tobacco breds, under illumination, the GFP content of the plant of incubation is significantly higher than the plant of dark lower incubation.In PM132, under illumination, the plant of incubation shows many 40% fluorescence than the plant of dark lower incubation.For PM15, under illumination, the plant of incubation shows many 200% fluorescence than the plant of dark lower incubation. 
 Pore in data presentation tobacco is rapidly in response to the change of illumination condition.The plant being placed in low light photograph shows between few 4 and 8 times of stomatal conductance than the plant of good illumination.The stomatal closure of having been illuminated the way by low light adversely affects vacuum immersion efficiency and therefore the GFP adversely reduced in tobacco expresses.The plant of dark lower incubation demonstrates leaf texture that huge area do not infiltrate and compared with the plant cultivated under normal lighting conditions, GFP expresses and reduces by more than 50%. 
   embodiment 17 : adopt the tobacco plant of enzyme to infiltrate
       
 The present embodiment describes the result of an experiment, and in described experiment, the tobacco plant degraded of prior agroinfiltration or the ferment treatment of digestion plant cell wall are with the Extraction and separation of auxiliary heterologous protein.Tobacco plant is infiltrated by the gene construct pC71 comprising H5 encoding sequence as described above, and is making transient expression and producing H5 to become incubation under possible greenhouse experiment.Prepare the aqueous mixture of enzyme: 0.05%Macerozyme, 0.4% Mierocrystalline cellulose, 0.066%Driselase, 0.6M N.F,USP MANNITOL, 0.7g/l2-(N-morpholino)-ethyl sulfonic acid (MES), pH5.6.In a sample of this enzyme mixture, glycine is added into concentration 15g/l. 
 By enzyme mixture by syringe, inject the bottom surface of tobacco leaf with the volume of every gram of leaf 0.3ml.In order to compare, by the thinly-sliced bar of leaf submergence incubation in identical mixture.In results with extract before H5, by leaf incubation 12 hours.Adopt the western blotting of anti-H5 antibody to show, obtain the H5 of analog quantity with enzyme mixture when tool is with or without glycine.It is also similar for infiltrating with the extraction efficiency by submergence chopping leaf by syringe.Result shows, and infiltrates tobacco leaf can be used for auxiliary from tobacco plant extraction heterologous protein with Cell wall digestion enzyme. 
 Although the present invention is described with explanation in detail and before, think that this kind of description is schematic or exemplary and is not restrictive.Be to be understood that and can change and amendment by making in the scope and spirit of the following claim of those of ordinary skill.Various publication and patent is quoted in this specification sheets in the whole text scope.The disclosure of every portion of publication and patent is complete to be by way of reference incorporated to.
