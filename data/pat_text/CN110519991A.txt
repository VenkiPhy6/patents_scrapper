 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to a kind of manufacturing methods of acidified milk.It specifically describes, the present invention relates in a kind of inhibition fermentation
The manufacturing method for the acidified milk that tart flavour is promoted. 
 
 
 Background technique 
 Acidified milk is Japanese " province of ingredient specification about milk and milk products etc. enables " (hereinafter referred to as " provinces such as cream enable ")
In is defined as: so that cream or the cream containing its same above ester-less milk solid etc. is fermented with lactic acid bacteria or yeast, from
And paste or liquid person are formed, or the person of being freezed.The example of acidified milk has rigid Yoghourt (solid state fermentation cream), soft Yoghourt
(paste acidified milk) and beverage formula Yoghourt (liquid acidified milk).Rigid Yoghourt is mainly by filling containers raw mixture
Afterwards, so that it ferment and solidify in container and obtain.Soft Yoghourt is by stirring after making raw mixture be fermented
Broken curdled milk, and mixed according to demand with pulp or baste etc., refilling is obtained in container.Beverage Yoghourt is by making raw material
After mixture is fermented, liquid is become using homogenizer etc., and mix according to demand with liquid glucose or pulp baste etc.,
It refills and is obtained in container. 
 In addition, the provinces such as Japanese cream enable ingredient specification in provide: acidified milk necessarily ester-less milk solid be 8.0% with
On, and total lactic acid bacteria number is 1.0 Ã— 10 7 Cfu/g or more.In addition, also being advised in the Yoghourt international standard according to FAO/WHO
It is fixed: must to have a large amount of microorganisms (lactobacillus bulgaricus, Thermophilic Bacteria) existence in end product. 
 In this way, acidified milk contains the raw bacterium of a large amount of lactic acid bacterias etc..Generally become the pH4.6 or less for stablizing and constituting in acidified milk
Afterwards, such as in order to which acidified milk is concentrated, and temperature range (such as 30 DEG C~50 DEG C) are promoted to keep under prolonged situation in fermentation,
PH, which can be reduced, by lactic acid bacteria lactic acid generated etc. makes tart flavour become strong.In this way, acidified milk is stored in fermentation for a long time
Under the situation for promoting temperature range, compared with concentration starts rear a moment, reduces, be difficult to because pH can pass via the time
The flavor or quality for keeping acidified milk fixed for a long time. 
 Thus, for example in order to manufacture the good high concentration Yoghourt of palatability, it is known to which a kind of manufacturing method, being will before fermentation
Cream concentration or milk composition powder is added in cream to be fermented (patent document 1) after modulating dense yogurt mixt.This
Outside, it is known that there are also a kind of Yoghourt manufacturing method, be by fermentation after Yoghourt be concentrated by UF membrane or centrifuge separation, thus
Assign dense sense (patent document 2).As other methods, also considering the side using the lower lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent of sour generative capacity
Method.

 Summary of the invention 
 Invent the project to be solved 
 However, in the revealed method of patent document 1, by be originated from dairy milk starting material mineral composition or milk composition powder from
The flavor of body has powder sense, bitter taste, the stronger project of saline taste.In addition, being made in the revealed method of patent document 2 by fermentation
Lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent tart flavour in enrichment process can be promoted, and have the feelings for reducing the palatability of the concentration Yoghourt finally obtained
Shape. 
 In addition, having fermentation time longer in the case where using the low lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent of sour generative capacity, being not suitable for work
Mass production in industry, and there is pH to be reduced to 4.4 process time shorter from 4.6, if quality can be generated if not cooling down promptly
The inconsistent problem of (especially tart flavour) degree.Also that is, in the case where industrial mass production acidified milk, if considering its manufacture effect
Rate, then expectation accelerates the fermenting speed of raw mixture (when shortening fermentation in the fermentation first half of pH6.6~pH4.6 or so
Between).But it will become if accelerating fermenting speed and generate lactic acid etc. in early period, therefore promote acidified milk to be stored in fermentation for a long time
When temperature range (such as 30 DEG C~50 DEG C), the pH in fermentation latter half can be reduced more, have tart flavour degree to become strong problem.
For this problem, it has not been able to propose that a kind of fermenting speed by first half of fermenting is maintained at suitable mass production acidified milk so far
Speed, and simultaneously can after fermentation half it is interim efficiently inhibit pH reduce technology. 
 In addition, standing for fermentation cream simultaneously separates light liquid especially in using Greek style Yoghourt as the concentration acidified milk represented
(whey) and the enrichment process needs of heavy-fluid (concentration acidified milk) take hours, therefore, if further progress is sent out during it
Ferment has the product tart flavour finally obtained and becomes strong project.As the countermeasure of this project, although can be reduced in enrichment process dense
Thus the temperature of contracting primary fermentation cream inhibits fermentation, but the separative efficiency of light liquid and heavy-fluid can be made extremely to reduce.In addition, as it
It is elongated and not to have fermentation time although also there is the method using the lower lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent of sour generative capacity for his countermeasure
The problem of being suitble to the industrial production of concentration acidified milk.Accordingly, it is considered to concentration acidified milk industrial production the case where, it is expected that using
Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Thermophilic Bacteria etc. have the lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent of fixed acid generative capacity, and make acidified milk in enrichment process
Temperature is maintained at about 40 DEG C.But under these conditions, the acidified milk in enrichment process will do it fermentation, and end product
The tart flavour of (concentration acidified milk) still can become strong.Thus, it is difficult to inhibit the tart flavour or fermentative smell of concentration acidified milk. 
 Therefore, general object of the present invention is to propose that especially the semiduation effectively can inhibit pH to reduce to one kind after fermentation
Acidified milk manufacturing method and lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent bacterial strain.In addition, present invention aims at, such as in manufacture concentration fermentation
When newborn, even if there is the lactic acid bacteria fermenting agent of fixed acid generative capacity using lactobacillus bulgaricus and Thermophilic Bacteria etc., and dense
In the case that maintenance acidified milk temperature is about 40 DEG C in contracting process, the pH being also able to suppress in enrichment process is reduced, to obtain
It must inhibit the concentration acidified milk of tart flavour or fermentative smell.
