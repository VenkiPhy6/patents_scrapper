 The present invention relates to a lactic acid bacterium belonging to the genus  Lactobacillus , which can produce γ-aminobutyric acid (to be referred to as “GABA” hereinafter) even under a condition wherein lactic acid exists in a medium at the time of commencement of culturing, and a method for producing a culture mixture comprising γ-aminobutyric acid using the same. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 GABA is an amino acid which is currently drawing attention since it has physiological effects such as a hypotensive effect, a diuretic effect and a tranquilizing effect. Since the food containing GABA is limited to some vegetable, tea, rice and the like and its content is also small, some methods for producing GABA using GABA fermenting lactic acid bacteria are proposed (e.g., see Patent References 1 to 3). As such GABA producing lactic acid bacteria,  Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactococcus lactis  subspecies  cremoris, Lactococcus lactis  subspecies  lactis, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus  and the like are known, which have the ability to produce GABA from L-glutamic acid or a salt of L-glutamic acid by decarboxylation reaction. 
 However, since these lactic acid bacteria require expensive components such as whey powder, skimmed milk, casein and peptone for the medium, the productivity from the viewpoint of cost is not good (e.g., see Patent Reference 1 or 4). Also, when soy sauce koji or gluten as an inexpensive material is degraded with an acid or degraded with an enzyme or koji, and the eluted glutamine is converted into glutamic acid by glutaminase to be used as the medium, the common salt generated by the neutralization or the common salt added as an antipollution countermeasure at the time of the enzymatic degradation inhibits the GABA production of lactic acid bacteria. Although several salinity tolerant GABA producing lactic acid bacteria have been reported, the optimum common salt concentration for GABA fermentation is a markedly high salinity of from 12.5 to 18% (e.g., see Patent Reference 5). When the promotion of a dietary life of intending hypochloric diet in order to avoid life style-related diseases is taken into consideration, the food and seasonings having high common salt content are not desirable. Additionally, since there is a side of expecting hypotensive activity from GABA, combination of it with high common salt concentration loses the original meaning. 
 Based on the above, for producing GABA by a lactic acid bacterium, although it is ideal to use inexpensive material such as koji and gluten by degrading it under a low common salt concentration, the low common salt concentration poses a problem of causing pollution by wild strains. The pollution occurs at an early stage of the culturing, and when an alcohol is produced or pH is lowered as a result, growth of the GABA producing lactic acid bacterium is inhibited. Therefore, sufficient amount of the object GABA cannot be obtained. As a means for preventing pollution by these wild strains at a low common salt concentration, there is a method which uses ethanol, acetic acid and lactic acid which are generally frequently used as food antiseptics. However, although ethanol and acetic acid suppress the contaminants, they also suppress the GABA producing lactic acid bacterium. On the other hand, since lactic acid bacteria produces lactic acid by themselves, they have higher resistance to lactic acid than other bacteria. 
 Accordingly, although the inventors of the present invention have considered about the use of lactic acid as antiseptics, there is a new problem that the GABA producing lactic acid bacterium cannot grow when lactic acid is added at the time of the commencement of culturing in the presence of common salt, or can grow but does not produce GABA.

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS 
   FIG. 1  shows a molecular genealogical tree of  Lactobacillus rennini  strains KG34, KG43, S1, KG31, KG64, KG-18-4 and KG4-14-1. 
 
 BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION 
 The lactic acid bacterium concerned in the present invention is a strain belonging to the genus  Lactobacillus , and for example, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from unrefined soy can be used. The lactic acid bacterium of the present invention has the ability to produce GABA under a coexisting condition of lactic acid and common salt in the medium at time of commencement of culturing, and can produce GABA under a coexisting condition of from 1 to 4% of lactic acid and from 8 to 12% of common salt. It is preferable that the lactic acid bacterium is  Lactobacillus rennini , and examples of the lactic acid includes,  Lactobacillus rennini  strain KG34,  Lactobacillus rennini  strain KG43 and the like. 
 The  Lactobacillus rennini  strain KG34 was deposited on Feb. 7, 2006, in the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), NITE Patent Microorganisms Depository (NPMD) (postal code 292-0818; 2-5-8, Kazusa Kamatari, Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan) (depository number NITE P-177), which was transferred to and accepted by the International Depository Authority on Sep. 1, 2006, under the Budapest Treaty (depository number NITE BP-177). All restrictions on public access to the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the grant of a patent on this application. 
 Also, the  Lactobacillus rennini  strain KG43 was deposited on Jan. 31, 2007, in the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), NITE Patent Microorganisms Depository (NPMD) (postal code 292-0818; 2-5-8 Kazusa Kamatari, Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan) (depository number NITE BP-309), which was immediately transferred to and accepted by the International Depository Authority under the Budapest Treaty (acceptance number NITE ABP-309). All restrictions on public access to the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the grant of a patent on this application. 
 Isolation of a lactic acid bacterium from unrefined soy is carried out by the following method. Namely, 25 g of unrefined soy is subjected to the stomaching treatment, an appropriate amount of the thus obtained liquid is added to an MRS-SOYTONE medium (5.5% MRS broth, 0.5% Bactosoytone, 0.5% sodium glutamate, 8% common salt, 5% food additive lactic acid, pH 5.1) charged with Durham tube, and static culture is carried out at 30° C. A culture medium in which generation of gas in the Durham tube was confirmed is appropriately diluted with the MRS-SOYTONE medium, and spread on a MRS-SOYTONE agar medium followed by culturing at 30° C. for 7 days in AnaeroPack Kenki (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Inc.). The thus obtained single colonies are again inoculated into the MRS-SOYTONE medium charged with Durham tube, and the strains in which generation of gas was confirmed are selected. 
 Seven strains KG34, KG43, S1, KG31, KG64, KG-18-4 and KG4-14-1 were isolated by the above method. Among the 7 strains, bacteriological properties of both of the strains KG34 and KG43 were examined, and the results shown in Table 1. As a comparative control, data on  Lactobacillus rennini  DMSZ 20253 as the standard strain of  Lactobacillus rennini  were also described therein. It can be seen that the standard strain  Lactobacillus rennini  DMSZ 20253 does not produce GABA since it does not have the glutamic acid decarboxylation ability.

 Additionally, 16S rDNA (16S rDNA gene) complete nucleotide sequences of the lactic acid bacterium of the present invention  Lactobacillus rennini  strains KG34, KG43, S1, KG31, KG64, KG-18-4 and KG4-14-1 were determined by the following method. 
 Each of the lactic acid bacterium  Lactobacillus rennini  strains KG34, KG43, S1, KG31, KG64, KG-18-4 and KG4-14-1 was inoculated into an MRS-Soytone medium (MRS broth 5.5%, Soytone 0.5%, NaCl 8%, sodium glutamate 0.5%, pH 5.1) and cultured at 30° C. for 4 days. GenTorukun™ (for yeast) (Takara Bio) was used for the extraction of genomic DNA. Complete region of the 16S rDNA was divided into three fragments and amplified by PCR using the thus extracted genomic DNA as the template. By sequencing respective fragments and connecting them, complete region sequence was obtained. Takara Thermal Cycler MP was used as the thermal cycler, and ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) is used as the DNA sequencer. The thus obtained respective 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2. 
 Homology retrieval of species considered to be close relatives of the bacterium from the obtained 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences was carried out. A molecular genealogical tree was prepared by a neighborhood connecting method with the closely-related species using the 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences. Study of the closely-related species and assignment classification groups is carried out. As a result of retrieval by NCBI BLAST, the bacterium showed the highest homology (about 99.5%) with the 16S rDNA of  Lactobacillus rennini , and formed the same cluster of  Lactobacillus rennini  in the genealogical tree. It was judged from the result that this bacterium is  Lactobacillus rennini . The thus prepared genealogical tree is shown in  FIG. 1 . 
 Although the lactic acid bacterium of the present invention has the ability to produce GABA from L-glutamic acid or a salt of L-glutamic acid in the absence of common salt and lactic acid, it also can produce GABA even under a coexisting condition of from 1 to 4% of lactic acid and from 8 to 12% of common salt in the medium at time of commencement of culturing (see Example 2). Additionally, other than the time of the commencement of culturing, it can produce GABA under a coexisting condition of from 0 to 4% of lactic acid and from 0 to 12% of common salt in the medium. 
 The method of the present invention for producing a culture mixture comprising GABA is a method in which a culture mixture comprising GABA is produced by inoculating a lactic acid bacterium having the above-mentioned properties into a medium containing L-glutamic acid and/or salts thereof and culturing the same. As the lactic acid bacterium to be used in the present invention, although a species isolated from unrefined soy, cultured and sub-cultured is used, the same species contained in unrefined soy may be used as such or by newly isolating it. Additionally, any one of the freeze-dried cells, cryopreserved strain and liquid culture broth may be used. 
 It is necessary that the medium to be used in the present invention contains glutamic acid in order to produce GABA. As the glutamic acid to be contained in the medium, although L-glutamic acid as a kind of amino acid is chemically preferable, it may be any one of the glutamic acid or sodium glutamate as a food additive agent having the use as a seasoning, other glutamic acid salts, and further the glutamic acid obtained by hydrolyzing a food protein with an acid or enzyme. Additionally, foods which contain free glutamic acid such as a seasoning, a processed marine product and a tomato can be used as such. In this connection, when a culture mixture comprising further large amount of GABA is obtained, it is necessary to use a medium containing further large amount of glutamic acid. 
 Also, in addition to the above-mentioned glutamic acid, it is preferable for the growth of the lactic acid bacterium that the medium to be used in the present invention contains at least one of sugars such as glucose, fructose and maltose, food containing vitamins and minerals such as yeast extract and meat extract, or koji and koji digests. Additionally, food additives such as an emulsifying agent, a stabilizing agent and a pH adjusting agent can also be used. Examples of the koji and koji digests which can be used in the medium include protein hydrolyzates prepared by allowing a koji fungus to react with, or enzymes of the koji fungus to react with, one or two or more of denaturation-treated materials selected from cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, pearl barley, pressed wheat or barley, quinoa, Italian millet, Japanese millet, millet, rice and corn and beans such as soybean, adzuki bean, kidney bean, lupine bean, glass bean and lens bean. Soy sauce, unrefined soy, miso, protein hydrolyzates of beans and the like, and the like are preferable. 
 Inoculation of the lactic acid bacterium in the present invention is carried out by culturing the above-mentioned  Lactobacillus rennini  capable of producing GABA, at from 25 to 35° C. for from 48 to 96 hours using a medium containing a glutamic acid source, common salt and a carbon source and having an initial pH of from 4.0 to 7.0, and inoculating the resulting lactic acid bacterium seed culture in a volume of approximately from 1/1,000 to 1/10 based on the volume of the main culture medium. 
 Although the size and quality of the material of the device which can be used in the culturing of the present invention is not limited, as long as it can be washed and heat-sterilized and can be used for the production of food, it is preferable that it has such a hygienic structure that it can hardly be contaminated by sundry germs. Regarding the culture conditions, the culture temperature is from 20 to 40° C., preferably from 25 to 35° C., and the initial pH is preferably from 4.0 to 7.0, based on the bacteriological properties of the lactic acid bacterium (see Table 1). Regarding the culture period, it is necessary to carry out for such a sufficient period of time that glutamic acid source such as L-glutamic acid and/or salts thereof can be converted into the desired concentration of GABA. For example, a period of from 1 to 4 weeks is preferable. 
 In this manner, a culture mixture comprising GABA which has broad applications as raw materials of processed food and the like can be obtained. For example, it is possible also to use the culture mixture comprising GABA obtained by the method of the present invention as a GABA reinforcing material by directly addition to various seasonings and food and drink. 
 Additionally, it can also be used by increasing the GABA content by treating steps such as compression, filtration, concentration and drying. As the above-mentioned filtration step, it can be carried out using a general compression filtration apparatus for food processing use which uses filter, filter cloth or the like, and filter aid for food use such as diatomaceous earth, cellulose and activated carbon can be used. For the concentration step, apparatus such as a vacuum concentrator, a reduced-pressure concentrator, a distillation still and a freeze concentrator can be used, and a method in which moisture in the culture mixture is evaporated by simply heating can also be used. Also, as the drying step, it is preferable to carry out a spray drying or freeze drying by an efficient and hygienic method. Additionally, in order to obtain a culture mixture in which the GABA content was further increased, a liquid chromatography or the method can also be used in addition to the above-mentioned steps. 
 By treating the culture mixture comprising GABA in the manner, liquid or powder foodstuffs comprising GABA can be obtained. By formulating them into various food articles or carrying out their secondary processing, seasonings or food and drink wherein GABA is reinforced can be easily obtained. In the secondary processing, components generally used in food such as excipient, sweetener, thickener, protein, peptide, lipid, polysaccharides, sugar and salts can be contained. 
 In this connection, measurement of the GABA content in the thus obtained culture mixture and seasonings and food and drink supplemented with the culture mixture can be carried out using instruments for analysis such as a high performance liquid chromatography and an amino acid analyzer, an analytical reagent using enzyme(s) and the like. 
 Although the following describes the present invention further in detail with reference to examples, the present invention is not limited thereto. 
 EXAMPLES 
 Example 1 
 <Acquisition of Lactic Acid Bacterium> 
 Appropriate amounts of samples to be tested were collected from various kinds of fermented food, and an appropriate amount of each sample was added to an MRS-SOYTONE medium (5.5% MRS broth, 0.5% Bactosoytone, 0.5% sodium glutamate, 8% common salt, 5% food additive lactic acid, pH 5.1) charged with Durham tube, and static culture was carried out at 30° C. A culture medium in which generation of gas in the Durham tube was confirmed was appropriately diluted with the MRS-SOYTONE medium and spread on an MRS-SOYTONE agar medium and followed by culture at 30° C. for 7 days in AnaeroPack Kenki (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Inc.). The thus obtained single colonies were again inoculated into the MRS-SOYTONE medium charged with Durham tube, and GABA in the samples in which generation of gas was confirmed was measured. In this connection, the strains isolated from the same isolation source were subjected to individual identification in order to avoid selection of two or more of the same strain. GABA was measured by a high performance amino acid analyzer L-8800 manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd. As a result, it was revealed that the strains KG34, KG43, S1, KG31, KG64, KG-18-4 and KG4-14-1 were producing GABA. In this connection, physiological properties of the strain KG34 and strain KG43 are shown in Table 1, and 16S rDNA sequences of the strain KG34 and strain KG43 are shown in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2. The 16S rDNA sequences of strain KG34 and strain KG43 coincided with each other 100%. 
 Example 2 
 <Confirmation of Salt Resistance and Lactic Acid Resistance> 
 Using a medium in which common salt was changed to 8% or 12%, and food additive lactic acid to 0%, 1% or 4%, based on an MRS-Soytone medium (5.5% MRS broth, 0.5% Soytone, 0.5% sodium glutamate, pH 5.1) charged with Durham tube, GABA productivities of the strains KG34, KG43, S1, KG31, KG64, KG-18-4 and KG4-14-1 were confirmed under such a condition that common salt and lactic acid are present in the medium at time of commencement of culture. Additionally, in that case, comparison with conventionally known GABA producing lactic acid bacteria was carried out, and the results are shown in Table 2.

 By adding 160 ml of warm water to 70 g of wheat gluten and 100 g of soy koji and further adding thereto as glutaminase, 5 ml of a culture broth obtained by 36 hours of aeration-agitation culturing of  Candida famata  km-1 (FERM P-8897) (medium composition: glucose 6%, yeast extract 1%, potassium dihydrogenphosphate 0.1%, magnesium sulfate 0.1%, pH 5.5, culture temperature 30° C.), degradation of gluten and conversion of glutamine formed by the degradation into glutamic acid were carried out at 50° C. for 24 hours. After adding common salt to the thus obtained degradation product to be a final concentration of 8% and further adding food additive lactic acid to be a final concentration of 1% followed by lowering the temperature to be 30° C.,  Lactobacillus rennini  strain KG34 or strain KG43 was inoculated to a density of about 10 6  cells/ml and cultured at 30° C. for 7 days with gentle stirring. Each of the thus obtained culture mixtures was filtered to obtain a clear liquid. The GABA content of the culture liquid into which the strain KG34 was inoculated was 13.0 mg/ml, and 19.5 mg/ml in the case of KG43. As a control, although the same test was carried out using a conventionally known GABA producing strain  Lactobacillus brevis  NBRC 3345, the GABA concentration of the finally obtained clear liquid was 2.0 mg/ml. Therefore, sufficient GABA production was not carried out. 
 While the present invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. 
 This application is based on a Japanese patent application filed on Feb. 21, 2006 (Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-043836), the entire contents thereof being thereby incorporated by reference. All of the references cited herein are incorporated as a whole. 
 INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
