   TECHNICAL FIELD 
   
    
    [0002]
     This application generally relates to the field of improved dry matrices for embedding viable  E. coli , method of making same and use thereof. 
   BACKGROUND 
   
    
    [0003]
     Bacterial spores are dormant life forms which can exist in a desiccated and dehydrated state indefinitely. For humans, bacterial spores are available either as over-the-counter prophylactics for mild gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea, or as health foods or nutritional supplements. In the agricultural industry, bacterial spores are also receiving increasing attention as potential alternatives to antibiotics as growth promoters (Hong et al.,  FEMS Microbiology Reviews,  2005, 29: 813-835).  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) are, however non-spore-forming, and as such, are less resistant to desiccation and/or dehydration conditions than spore-forming bacteria. In many applications, it is nevertheless necessary to preserve and store  E. coli  bacteria in a form that affords sufficient viability and/or sufficient bacterial bioactivity for a given purpose. 
     
    
    [0004]
     In this regard, various practical preservation and storage conditions for bacteria have been previously suggested. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Freeze-drying (also named lyophilisation) is often used for preservation and storage of bacteria because of the low temperature exposure during drying (Rhodes,  Exploitation of microorganisms  ed. Jones, D G, 1993, p. 411-439, London: Chapman & Hall). However, it has the undesirable characteristics of significantly reducing viability as well as being time and energy-intensive. Protective agents have been proposed, but the protection afforded by a given additive during freeze-drying varies with the species of micro-organism (Font de Valdez et al.,  Cryobiology,  1983, 20: 560-566). 
     
    
    [0006]
     Air drying such as with desiccation has also been used for preservation and storage of bacteria. While vacuum drying is a similar process as freeze-drying, it takes place at 0°-40° C. for 30 min to a few hours. The advantages of this process are that the product is not frozen, so the energy consumption and the related economic impact are reduced. In the product point of view, the freezing damage is avoided. However, desiccation at low or ambient temperature is slow, requires extra precautions to avoid contamination, and often yields unsatisfactory viability (Lievense et al.,  Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol.,  1994, 51:71-89). 
     
    
    [0007]
     Encapsulating bacteria in hydrocolloid-forming polysaccharide matrix, such as Calcium-alginate (Ca-alginate) beads, has also been used for preservation and storage of bacteria in a broad and increasing range of different applications (Islam et al.,  J. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,  2010, 20:1367-1377). To maintain the bacteria in a metabolically and physiologically competent state and thus obtain the desired benefit, it has been suggested to add to such matrices a suitable preservative formulation. Preservative formulations typically contain active ingredients in a suitable carrier and additives that aid in the stabilization and protection of the microbial cells during storage, transport and at the target zone. 
     
    
    [0008]
     Mannitol has been described as an effective preservative formulation component for Ca-alginate encapsulated bacteria during freeze-drying as it affords high bacterial viability up to 10 weeks under room temperature and water activity (a w ) of less than 0.2 (Efiuvwevwere et al.,  Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,  1999, 51:100-104). A synergistic mixture of trehalose and a sugar alcohol has also been described as an effective preservative formulation component for air-dried Ca-alginate encapsulated bacteria, where trehalose is used instead of sucrose for its significantly higher glass transition temperature, i.e., 110° C. vs. only 65° C., respectively (U.S. Pat. No. 8,097,245). A synergistic mixture of carboxylic acid salts and hydrolyzed proteins has also been described as an effective preservative formulation component for freeze-dried Ca-alginate encapsulated bacteria (U.S. 2013/0,296,165). In both cases, the synergistic mixture affords an enhanced glassy structure without the need for foaming or boiling under vacuum to facilitate effective drying. 
     
    
    [0009]
     The development of novel formulations is, however, a challenging task and not all formulation are effective for a given bacteria (Youg et al.,  Biotechnol Bioeng.,  2006 Sep. 5; 95(1):76-83). 
     
    
    [0010]
     In light of the above, there is a need to provide improved preservation and storage conditions for  E. coli  bacteria.

     In the drawings, embodiments are illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood that the description and drawings are only for the purpose of illustrating certain embodiments and are an aid for understanding. The scope of the claims should not be limited by the embodiments set forth in the present disclosure, but should be given the broadest interpretation consistent with the description as a whole. 
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 
   
    
    [0028]
     Specific examples will now be described to illustrate the manner in which the principles of the present disclosure may be put into practice. 
     
    
    [0029]
     The herein described  E. coli  bacteria are viable bacteria, in other words, while the bacteria embedded in a dry matrix can be considered as being in a non-active state, these bacteria can be restored to an active state upon exposing the matrix to moisture. 
     
    
    [0030]
     The herein described  E. coli  bacteria comprise any recombinant or wild  E. coli  strain, or any mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the  E. coli  is a non-pathogenic strain. In one embodiment, the non-pathogenic  E. coli  strain is the strain deposited at the International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC) on Jan. 21, 2005 under accession number IDAC 210105-01, or the strain deposited at the International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC) on Jun. 20, 2013 and attributed accession number 200613-01, or a combination thereof. 
     
    
    [0031]
     The herein described matrix comprises a hydrocolloid-forming polysaccharide. Several polysaccharides are suitable for use as described herein, alone or in any combination thereof. 
     
    
    [0032]
     High amylose starch is a polysaccharide capable of forming firm gel after hydrating the starch granules in boiling water, dispersing the granules with the aid of high shear mixer and then cooling the solution to about 0-10° C. The firmness and strength of the gel depend on the concentration of the starch in the solution, with a maximal workable concentration of up to 10% w/v. The sliced starch gel matrix is also capable of retaining the live bacteria in the preservation mixture, and since it is mostly non-digestible by intestinal or gastric juices, the bacteria are protected from gastric destruction while within the starch matrix. The controlled release mechanism is provided by the fact that high amylose starch is readily digestible by the gut microflora at which time the delivered live bacteria are then released in their intact form. 
     
    
    [0033]
     Pectin is another suitable polysaccharide that performs very similar to high amylose starch. Pectin has an additional advantage since the strength of the pectin gel matrix can be further increased by the addition of divalent cations such as Ca 2+  that forms bridges between carboxyl groups of the sugar polymers. 
     
    
    [0034]
     Alginate is another suitable polysaccharide that can form a firm gel matrix by cross-linking with divalent cations. The alginate can be hardened into a firm gel matrix by internally cross-linking the alginate polysaccharides with a dication, e.g. Ca 2+ , for example by extruding the alginate in the form of thin threads, strings, or substantially spherical beads into a Ca 2+  bath. The alginate hardens upon interaction with Ca 2+ . An alternative method of preparation of the matrix is to spray atomize the mixture into a bath containing Ca 2+ . 
     
    
    [0035]
     In one embodiment, the hydrocolloid-forming polysaccharide is present in the matrix in percent by weight of total dry matter at a value of from 0.1% to 20%. In one embodiment, the hydrocolloid-forming polysaccharide is present in the matrix in percent by weight of total dry matter at a value of from 0.1% to 19%, or from 0.1% to 18%, or from 0.1% to 17%, or from 0.1% to 16%, or from 0.1% to 15%, or from 0.1% to 14%, or from 0.1% to 13%, or from 0.1% to 12%, or from 1% to 12%, including any value therein. 
     
    
    [0036]
     The herein described matrix further comprises a disaccharide and a polysaccharide. The present disclosure discloses several concentrations and proportions suitable for inclusion in the matrix. In one embodiment, a suitable ratio of disaccharide/polysaccharide in wt. %/wt. % is of less than 10 or more preferably of less than 5. In one embodiment, the ratio of disaccharide/polysaccharide in wt. %/wt. % is of about 1. 
     
    
    [0037]
     In one embodiment, the disaccharide is present in the matrix in percent by weight of total dry matter at a value of from 0.1% to 90%, or from 0.1% to 75%, or from 0.1% to 50%, or from 0.1% to 35%, or from 0.1% to 20%, or from 0.1% to 15%, or from 0.1% to 10%, including any value therein. 
     
    
    [0038]
     In one non-limiting embodiment, the disaccharide includes sucrose. 
     
    
    [0039]
     In a further non-limiting embodiment, the disaccharide includes trehalose. 
     
    
    [0040]
     In one non-limiting embodiment, the polysaccharide includes maltodextrine. 
     
    
    [0041]
     In a further non-limiting embodiment, the polysaccharide includes dextran. 
     
    
    [0042]
     In a further non-limiting embodiment, the dextran has a molecular weight between 20 and 70 kDa. 
     
    
    [0043]
     In one embodiment, the matrix further includes a salt of L-glutamic acid. In one non-limiting embodiment, the salt is a sodium salt of L-glutamic acid. 
     
    
    [0044]
     The herein described matrix has a water activity (“a w ”) which is of 0.04≤a W ≤0.3, for example 0.04≤a w ≤2.5, 0.04≤a w ≤2.0, 0.04≤a w ≤1.5, and the like. “Water activity” or “a w ” in the context of the present disclosure, refers to the availability of water and represents the energy status of the water in a system. Water activity may be measured according to materials and procedures known in the art, for example, using an Aqualab Water Activity Meter 4TE (Decagon Devices, Inc., U.S.A.). 
     
    
    [0045]
     There is also provided a composition for forming a matrix, the composition comprising a first hydrocolloid-forming polysaccharide, a second polysaccharide which is different from the first polysaccharide, and a disaccharide which includes sucrose, trehalose, or a combination thereof and an  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ). 
     
    
    [0046]
     There is also provided a method for providing a particulate comprising viable  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ), the method comprising providing particles comprising a first hydrocolloid-forming polysaccharide, a second polysaccharide which is different from the first polysaccharide, and a disaccharide which includes sucrose, trehalose, or a combination thereof and  E. coli  and drying said particles to water water activity (a w )≤0.3. 
     
    
    [0047]
     In one non-limiting embodiment, the viable  E. coli  sustains an a w  fold reduction in the particles of at least 0.4, or at least 0.5, or at least 0.6, or at least 0.7.

   1. Example 1 
   
    
    [0051]
     a.  E. coli  Culture 
     
    
    [0052]
     With reference to  FIG. 1 , an  E. coli  strain was cultivated in a  first step  100 on Tryptic Soy Agar of non-animal origin. Six (6) isolated colonies were then used to cultivate the  E. coli  strain in a  second step  200 for 2 hours at 37° C. and agitation at 200 rpm in 30 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) of non-animal origin (for 1 L of TSB: 20 g of Soy Peptone A3 SC—(Organotechnie), 2.5 g anhydrous dextrose USP—(J. T. Baker), 5 g sodium chloride USP—(J. T. Baker), and 2.5 g dibasic potassium phosphate USP—(Fisher Chemical)). The resulting  Culture  1 was diluted by a factor of 10 in TSB and was then used to cultivate the  E. coli  strain in a  third step  300 for 2 hours at 37° C. and agitation at 200 rpm in 100 mL of TSB of non-animal origin. The resulting  Culture  2 was diluted by a factor of 10 in TSB and was then used to cultivate the  E. coli  strain in a  fourth step  400 for 5 hours at 37° C. and agitation at 200 rpm in 1 L of TSB of non-animal origin. The resulting  Culture  3 was then used to embed  E. coli  in matrix. Variations and refinements to the culture protocol herein described are possible and will become apparent to persons skilled in the art in light of the present teachings. For example, the non-pathogenic  E. coli  may also be cultivated in anaerobic conditions according to protocols known in the art (Son & Taylor,  Curr. Protoc. Microbiol.,  2012, 27:5A.4.1-5A.4.9). In preparing the beads of the subsequent examples, the non-pathogenic  E. coli  strain deposited at the International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC) on Jan. 21, 2005 under accession number IDAC 210105-01 may be selected. 
     b. Matrix Preparation 
     
    
    [0053]
     Bacto™ peptone (1.5 g, BD, Mississauga, Canada) was mixed with 1.5 L of heated water to obtain a mixture. Alginate (30 g Grindsted®, DuPont™ Danisco®, Mississauga, Canada) was slowly added to the mixture while mixing with a magnetic bar at 360 rpm. Complete solubilisation of alginate was obtained in about 3 h to obtain a 2% alginate (m/v) solution. The solution including the magnetic bar was then autoclaved under standard conditions. Variations and refinements to the matrix preparation protocol herein described are possible and will become apparent to persons skilled in the art in light of the present teachings. 
     c. Embedding  E. coli  in Matrix 
     
    
    [0054]
     The following was added, in order and while mixing with the magnetic bar, to the autoclaved matrix solution to obtain a slurry: 1 L of TSB of non-animal origin and, with reference to  FIG. 1 , 0.5 L of the resulting  Culture  3 of  E. coli  in 1 L of TSB of non-animal origin. The slurry was extruded into a polymerization bath (300 mM CaCl 2 ), 0.1 wt./v. % Bacto™ tryptone, 0.1 wt./v. % Bacto™ peptone, and 0.05 wt./v. % g Bacto™ yeast extract in water) to form beads using a 9 exit syringe system adapted from the Thermo Scientific™ Reacti-Vap™ Evaporators. The bath was gently stirred while injecting the slurry. The matrix beads were allowed to cross-link for about 30 minutes, and the resulting hardened beads were then harvested. Variations and refinements to the embedding protocol herein described are possible and will become apparent to persons skilled in the art in light of the present teachings. 
     d. Drying and Testing of Embedded  E. coli    
     
    
    [0055]
     For each preservation solution the drying and testing was performed at least in triplicates. With reference to  FIG. 2 , in a  first step  500 the beads with embedded  E. coli  in the matrix were placed in a preservation solution S1, a preservation solution S2, a preservation solution S3 or a preservation solution S4 with gentle stirring for about 20 minutes. In each case, a determination of  total CFU  550 was performed after soaking in the preservation solution. In a  second step  600 the beads were then placed on a tray dryer in an air dryer at room temperature for about 24 h to obtain semi-dry beads. In each case, a measurement of water activity a w  650 was performed on the semi-dry beads using an Aqualab Water Activity Meter 4TE (Decagon Devices, Inc., U.S.A.). In a  third step  700 the semi-dry beads were then placed in a desiccator for about 64 h, in which dry and filtered air was blown. In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the  drying process  800 includes at least two steps: a  step  600 which includes placing beads in an air dryer for 24 hours at room temperature and to obtain semi-dry beads and a  step  700 which includes placing the semi-dry beads in a desiccator for 64 hours to obtain dry beads. In each case, a determination of  total CFU  750 and a measurement of water a w  760 were performed on the dry beads. Dry beads having a water activity a w  of ≤0.3 were obtained. 
     
    
    [0056]
     In each case, and with reference to  FIG. 2 , the a w  fold reduction was calculated according to the following:

e. Incorporating Dried Embedded  E. coli  into a Feed (“Pelleting”)
 
     
    
    [0061]
     Protocol for incorporating dried matrix into a feed, for example in the form of a feed additive are known in the art. An illustrative example of doing such can be done, e.g., by incorporating 500 g to 1000 g of dried matrix beads into a ton of feed. If desired, the feed can also include inactivated yeast product in suitable amounts. For instance, the dried matrix beads comprising the embedded  E. coli  are mixed in a homogenization tank with all other ingredients. Preferably, the mixture is continuously mixed during the pelleting process. The mixed material is then pumped towards an extruder. Steam is then applied on the mixed material that is about to enter the extruder (i.e., hence, the temperature of the mixture increases at this stage). Suitable pressure is then applied on the mixture during its passage inside the extruder (pressure and temperature increase, point where highest temperature reached, around 75° C.). The formed pellets are then expelled out of the extruder into a cooling tank (rapid temperature drops to 30-40° C. followed by another cool down, to reach ambient temperature). Pelleted feed including the feed additive (matrix comprising embedded  E. coli ) can then be stored, for example in bags/containers. Variations and refinements to the pelleting protocol herein described are possible and will become apparent to persons skilled in the art in light of the present teachings. 
   2. Example 2 
   
    
    [0062]
     For each preservation solution the drying and testing was performed at least in triplicates. With reference to  FIG. 2 , in a  first step  500 beads prepared as in Example 1 were placed in a preservation solution S1, a preservation solution S5, a preservation solution S6 or a preservation solution S7 with gentle stirring for about 20 minutes. In each case, a determination of  total CFU  550 was performed after soaking in the preservation solution. In a  second step  600 the beads were then placed on a tray dryer in an air dryer at room temperature for about 24 h to obtain semi-dry beads. In each case, a measurement of water activity a w  650 was performed on the semi-dry beads using an Aqualab Water Activity Meter 4TE (Decagon Devices, Inc., U.S.A.). In a  third step  700 the semi-dry beads were then placed in a desiccator for about 64 h, in which dry and filtered air was blown. In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the  drying process  800 includes at least two steps: a  step  600 which includes placing beads in an air dryer for 24 hours at room temperature and to obtain semi-dry beads and a  step  700 which includes placing the semi-dry beads in a desiccator for 64 hours to obtain dry beads. In each case, a determination of  total CFU  750 and a measurement of water a w  760 were performed on the dry beads. Dry beads having a water activity a w  of ≤0.3 were obtained.

       CFU loss=log 10 (550)−log 10 (750)
 
     
    
    [0065]
     In each case, an average viability loss and normalized average viability loss relative to the results obtained with preservation solution S1 was calculated. 
     
    
    [0066]
     The results are shown in  FIG. 4 . Preservation solution S7 showed a normalized average viability loss of 0.38 while sustaining a water activity of 0.298±0.013.

     A compilation of the results of Example 2 is set forth in Tables 4 and 5. These results demonstrate that the elements of preservation solution S7 provided a significant protective effect to the viability of the  E. coli  embedded in the dried matrix and its resistance to the  drying process  700.

   6. Example 6 
   
    
    [0086]
     For each preservation solution the drying and testing was performed at least in triplicates. With reference to  FIG. 2 , in a  first step  500 beads prepared as in Example 1 were placed in either a preservation solution S1, a preservation solution S16, a preservation solution S17 or a preservation solution S18 with gentle stirring for about 20 minutes. In each case, a determination of  total CFU  550 was performed after soaking in the preservation solution. In a  second step  600 the beads were then placed on a tray dryer in an air dryer at room temperature for about 24 h to obtain semi-dry beads. In each case, a measurement of water activity a w  650 was performed on the semi-dry beads using an Aqualab Water Activity Meter 4TE (Decagon Devices, Inc., U.S.A.). In a  third step  700 the semi-dry beads were then placed in a desiccator for about 64 h, in which dry and filtered air was blown. In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the  drying process  800 includes at least two steps: a  step  600 which includes placing beads in an air dryer for 24 hours at room temperature and to obtain semi-dry beads and a  step  700 which includes placing the semi-dry beads in a desiccator for 64 hours to obtain dry beads. In each case, a determination of  total CFU  750 and a measurement of water a w  760 were performed on the dry beads. Dry beads having a water activity a w  of ≤0.3 were obtained.

     In brief, the present inventor has surprisingly and unexpectedly observed that a matrix comprising embedded viable  E. coli  as described herein was capable of preserving viability of sufficient bacteria CFU over a given period of time, e.g. 4 weeks, for a commercial use thereof. For example, the matrix was successfully incorporated into a pelleted animal feed such that the animal feed could be stored/transported/handled and eventually administered to an animal while retaining sufficient viable CFU/g of animal feed to provide the beneficial effect normally associated with the bacteria.
