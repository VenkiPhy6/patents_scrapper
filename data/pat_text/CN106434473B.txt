Reach lower value, but when temperature it is excessively high more than 31 DEG C when, alcoholic strength is declined, and bitter peptides gradually rise, and temperature, which is crossed, makes strain
Breeding and metabolic capability decline instead, the accumulation of alcohol gradually decreases, comprehensive ferment local-flavor and mouthfeel, thus select 31 DEG C for
Optimum fermentation temp the most. 
 (3) influence of the different fermentations time to fermentation 
 By attached drawing 6 it is found that with fermentation time extension, saccharomycete obtained sufficient growth, alcoholic strength and total acid by
Edge up height.In -72h for 24 hours, the alcohol content of fermentation liquid is gradually risen, and bitter taste peptide content is gradually decreased with total reducing sugar, fermentation time
To be inflection point when 72h, bitter taste peptide content reaches minimum 0.72g/100mL in fermentation liquid, and it is 6.5% that alcoholic strength, which reaches peak,
Vol, illustrate fermenting microbe growth it is vigorous, can make full use of carbon source, be translated into alcohol, when fermenting between in 72h-120h
When, bitter peptides, total acid gradually rise, and the alcohol accumulation of fermentation liquid is substantially reduced, and is comprehensively considered, select fermentation time for
72h is best. 
 (4) influence of the different sugar additive amount to fermentation 
 During the fermentation, sugared additive amount provides carbon source for saccharomycete and lactic acid bacteria, and sufficient carbon source enhances bacterial strain
Fermentability.By attached drawing 7 it is found that total reducing sugar and alcohol content are increased with the raising of sugared additive amount, sugared additive amount is in 8%-
When between 10%, alcoholic strength accumulation is gradually increased, and it is 0.36g/100mL that bitter taste peptide content, which reaches minimum value, but works as sugaring amount
When more than 10%, alcohol content tends to be steady, and bitter peptides are increased, and strain fermentation ability is gentle and has a declining tendency, can
It can be the sugared excessive concentration in whey pear juice fermentation liquid, it is suppressed that saccharomycete and lactic acid bacteria because addition cane sugar content is excessively high
Fermentation, so that alcoholic strength declines, the higher reason of pol.Therefore, select for the above reasons sugaring amount for 10% the most
Appropriately.
