 [Invention Title] 
 METHOD FOR SCREENING FOR ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT 
 [Technical Field] 
 [1] The present disclosure relates to a method for 
 screening for antimicrobial agents to control odor 
 causing microorganisms in an air conditioning system and 
 a method for removing odors in an air conditioning 
 system. 
 [Background Art] 
 [2] Clean air is recognized as essential to human 
 health and well-being, and air inducing offensive odors 
 or contaminated air is a main culprit that hinders the 
 pleasant environment. For example, quality of 
 unsatisfactory indoor air under closed conditions is 
 caused by the following two important factors: one is 
 indoor air contamination that is generated directly from 
 the material (building, vehicle, etc.) itself 
 constituting the enclosed environment (building, vehicle, 
 etc.) and the another factor is the smell which is caused 
 by human activity or a substance fed from the outside. 
 [3] Air conditioning systems are systems that reduce the indoor temperature and optimize the indoor environment, for air conditioning including conditioning the temperature, humidity, airflow and cleanliness of the air in buildings, vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and the like. These air conditioning systems are becoming more popular with improvement in standards of living. 
 However, although the prevalence of air conditioning 
 systems has brought about a great development in basic 
 functions, many environmental issues to improve the 
 quality of indoor air remain unsolved. 
 [4] Although the cause of odor of air conditioners 
 among air conditioning systems is known to be metabolites 
 of fungi and bacteria, there is no specific data 
 regarding the types of fungi and bacteria, and amounts of 
 metabolites secreted by the corresponding microorganisms. 
 [5] Due to the structure of the air conditioning 
 system, all air passing through the blower passes through 
 the evaporator core (eva core). When heat exchange is 
 carried out between cold refrigerant and air, condensate 
 water condenses on the surface of the evaporator core due 
 to temperature difference. The continuous condensation of 
 condensate water provides an environment beneficial to 
 propagation of fungi and bacteria. When fungi and 
 bacteria proliferate in the evaporator core exposed to outside air, volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) of microorganisms are produced from metabolites of bacteria perforated on the surface of the evaporator core. When the air passing through the evaporator core is blown into the room, the room may be exposed to odor of fungi and bacteria upon use for a long time due to volatile organic compounds produced by microorganisms. 
 [6] The surface of the evaporator core where odors 
 are emitted is covered with a biofilm as the air 
 conditioning system is used for a long period of time. 
 Biofilms are composed of bacteria, cell clusters and EPS. 
 EPS contains a variety of ingredients including proteins, 
 polysaccharides, polyuronic acid, nucleic acids, lipids 
 and the like. On the surface of the evaporator core, a 
 variety of bacteria and fungi proliferate using biofilms 
 as nutrients to release organic compounds (mVOCs) as 
 metabolites by microorganisms. At this time, the odor 
 emitted from the organic compounds (mVOCs) is known as 
 rancidity among various factors of offensive odor of air 
 conditioners. 
 [7] Although various types of fragrances to remove 
 offensive odors are commercially available, such 
 fragrances cannot fundamentally remove fungi and bacteria 
 growing on the evaporator core, and merely serve to temporarily relieve unpleasant odors. Currently commercially available antimicrobial agents are sold just because they have antibacterial activities to common pathogens, even though they have not been developed to target specific fungi or bacteria. 
 [8] Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop 
 antimicrobial agents which are capable of creating a 
 pleasant indoor air environment and technologies which 
 are capable of removing unpleasant odors using the 
 antimicrobial agents by clearly identifying the kinds of 
 fungi and bacteria grown on the evaporator core and 
 specifically blocking or preventing propagation of fungi 
 and bacteria. 
 [9] The above description of the background art is 
 intended only to improve understanding of the background 
 of the present disclosure and should not be construed as 
 recognizing that the above-described technologies are 
 known to those having ordinary skill in the technical 
 field to which the present disclosure pertains. 
 [Disclosure] 
 [Technical Problem] 
 [10] The present inventors made attempts to find 
 methods of effectively controlling odor-generating microorganisms using odorless microorganisms. As a result, they successfully isolated four species of microorganisms which do not generate odors in an air conditioning system and completed the present disclosure, based on the finding that, when forming a biofilm with these microorganisms or a combination thereof, growth of microorganisms emitting an offensive odor can be prevented and, as a result, generation of an offensive odor can be prevented. 
 [11] 
 [12] Therefore, the present disclosure has been made 
 in view of the above problems, and it is one object of 
 the present disclosure to provide a method for screening 
 an antimicrobial agent against at least one 
 microorganism causing an offensive odor in an air 
 conditioning system, wherein the microorganism is 
 selected from the group consisting of Pelomonas puraquae, 
 Spirosoma radiotolerans, Fibrella aestuarina, 
 Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma linguale, 
 and Geobacillus toebii. 
 [13] 
 [14] It is another object of the present disclosure 
 to provide odor-causing microorganisms in an air 
 conditioning system. 
 [15] It is another object of the present disclosure 
 to provide a method for inhibiting growth of odor 
 causing microorganisms in an air-conditioning system 
 including applying or spraying an antimicrobial agent 
 onto the air-conditioning system. 
 [16] 
 [17] It is another object of the present disclosure 
 to provide a method for removing offensive odors in an 
 air-conditioning system including isolating or removing 
 odor-causing microorganisms from the air-conditioning 
 system. 
 [18] It is another object of the present disclosure 
 to provide a method for removing offensive odors in an 
 air-conditioning system including inhibiting growth of 
 odor-causing microorganisms in the air-conditioning 
 system. 
 [19] 
 [20] Other features and aspects of the present 
 disclosure will be apparent from the following detailed 
 description, drawings and claims. 
 [Technical Solution] 
 [21] In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for screening for antimicrobial agents to reduce offensive odors in an air-conditioning system including the following steps: 
 [22] To be specific, the method is a method for 
 screening an antimicrobial agent in an air-conditioning 
 system to remove odors generated from at least one 
 microorganism selected from the group consisting of 
 Pelomonas puraquae, Spirosoma radiotolerans, Fibrella 
 aestuarina, Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma 
 linguale, and Geobacillus toebii, 
 [23] (a) preparing the microorganism or a culture 
 solution thereof; 
 [24] (b) bringing the microorganism or a culture 
 solution thereof into contact with a sample; 
 [25] (c) measuring growth inhibition of the 
 microorganism; and 
 [26] (d) considering the sample to have antibacterial 
 activity to reduce offensive odors in an air 
 conditioning system, when growth of the microorganism is 
 inhibited. 
 [27] 
 [28] The present inventors made attempts to identify 
 microorganisms causing offensive odors and found methods which are capable of effectively controlling microorganisms. As a result, they successfully isolated six species of microorganisms, which created and grew a biofilm in an air conditioning system, and found that offensive odors generated from the air conditioning system can be significantly prevented by controlling these microorganisms. 
 [29] 
 [30] As herein used, the term "air conditioning 
 system" generically refers to a system which can 
 maintain the temperature, humidity, cleanliness, flow or 
 the like of air pleasant in an area, a part or entirety 
 of which is isolated from an outdoor environment. 
 Preferably, for example, the isolated area may be an 
 indoor area, a part or the entirety of which is isolated 
 from an outdoor environment, like the inside of a 
 building or the inside of a vehicle, train, ship, 
 aircraft or the like. Preferably, the air conditioning 
 system is for example an air conditioner. 
 [31] Based on the structure of the air conditioning 
 system, all air having passed through a blower passes 
 through the evaporator core and condensate water 
 continuously condenses on the surface of the evaporator 
 core due to temperature difference, providing an environment which is beneficial for growth of microorganisms. After a long time, a biofilm is formed. 
 At this time, microorganisms metabolize various indoor 
 and outdoor materials as nutrients present in the air, 
 generating odors derived from volatile organic compounds 
 (mVOCs) produced as a result of metabolism. 
 [32] Biofilms are a form of microbial communities 
 wherein microorganisms live as clusters, have a 
 structure in which a layer is surrounded by one membrane, 
 and serve to protect microorganisms from the outside 
 environment and provide nutrients. Exopolymeric 
 substances (EPSs) are present as an ingredient 
 constituting the film and contain a variety of 
 ingredients such as proteins, polysaccharides, 
 polyuronic acids, nucleic acids, and lipids. On the 
 surface of the evaporator core, various microorganisms 
 proliferate from the substances as nutrients and emit 
 unpleasant odors from metabolites. 
 [33] The present inventors isolated microorganisms 
 which generate odors from the evaporator core and, as a 
 result of culture of the microorganisms, separated and 
 cultured dominant strains among microorganisms forming 
 colonies. The method of separating and culturing 
 dominant strains can be carried out using a variety of methods well-known to those skilled in the art. For example, dominant microorganisms can be selected through morphological approaches, such as dilution rate, and color, size or shape of colonies. 
 [34] The dominant microorganism includes the genera 
 Fibrella, Ch-ryseobacterium, Spirosoma, Geobacillus, or 
 Pelomonas, preferably, Fibrella aestuarina, 
 Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma linguale, 
 Spirosoma radiotolerans, Geobacillus toebii, or 
 Pelomonas puraquae. 
 [35] The microorganisms were deposited at the Korea 
 Culture Center of Microorganisms on April 17, 2015 and 
 were given the following accession numbers: Fibrella 
 aestuarina HKMC-115 (accession number: KCCM 11691P), 
 Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae HKMC-116 (accession 
 number: KCCM 11692P), Spirosoma linguale HKMC-117 
 (accession number: KCCM 11693P), Spirosoma radiotolerans 
 HKMC-114 (accession number: KCCM 11690P), Geobacillus 
 toebii HKMC-118 (accession number: KCCM 11694P), and 
 Pelomonas puraquae HKMC-113 (accession number: KCCM 
 11689P). 
 [36] The odor-causing microorganisms have a variety 
 of industrial applicability. For example, the odor 
 causing microorganisms can be used to develop novel antibacterial agents to inhibit growth of microorganisms and develop an air freshener for removing offensive odors by identifying the chemical properties of the metabolites of the microorganisms. In addition, the odor-causing microorganisms may be used to fundamentally remove the cause of offensive odors by providing an air conditioning system with an environment where the microorganisms cannot live. 
 [37] The sample used in the method for screening an 
 antimicrobial agent of the present disclosure is used to 
 determine whether it has antimicrobial activity against 
 the microorganisms. For example, when a particular 
 sample has antimicrobial activity against Pelomonas 
 puraquae, the sample may be screened as an antimicrobial 
 agent against Pelomonas puraquae. 
 [38] Preferably, the antimicrobial agent screened by 
 the screening method of the present disclosure may have 
 antimicrobial activity against Pelomonas puraquae, more 
 preferably, against other species of microorganisms. 
 [39] For example, some antimicrobial agents may have 
 antimicrobial activity against all six species of 
 microorganisms and another antimicrobial agent may have 
 no antimicrobial activity at all against one or more of 
 the species. In addition, the antimicrobial agent having antimicrobial activity against all six species of microorganisms may have different antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms (see Table 8). 
 [40] In one preferred exemplary embodiment of the 
 present disclosure, the sample to be screened includes a 
 single compound, a mixture of compounds, an animal or 
 plant extract, a biological agent containing genetic 
 information such as a nucleotide, a polypeptide and the 
 like, and a mixture of compound and biological agent. 
 [41] 
 [42] In another aspect, the present disclosure 
 provides a microorganism causing offensive odors in an 
 air-conditioning system. 
 [43] Preferably, the microorganism causing an 
 offensive odor includes one or more selected from the 
 group consisting of Pelomonas puraquae, Spirosoma 
 radiotolerans, Fibrella aestuarina, Chryseobacterium 
 geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma linguale, and Geobacillus 
 toebii. 
 [44] 
 [45] In another aspect, the present disclosure 
 provides a method for inhibiting the growth of a 
 microorganism causing offensive odors in an air conditioning system, including coating or spraying the antimicrobial agent onto an air-conditioning system. 
 [46] The antimicrobial agent that may be used in the 
 present disclosure may be any antimicrobial agent which 
 is determined or can be determined to have antimicrobial 
 activity against one or more microorganisms selected 
 from the group consisting of Pelomonas puraquae, 
 Spirosoma radiotolerans, Fibrella aestuarina, 
 Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma linguale, 
 and Geobacillus toebii. 
 [47] The antimicrobial agent may be coated or sprayed 
 into an air-conditioning system to inhibit growth of the 
 odor-causing microorganisms and microorganisms including 
 the same, and the coating or spraying may be carried out 
 in various forms known in the art, such as gas, liquid, 
 gel or suspension of a solid. 
 [48] In addition, the coating or spraying may be 
 performed partly or wholly on the inner surface or inner 
 components of the air-conditioning system. Preferably, 
 the coating or spraying may be performed on an 
 evaporator core in the air-conditioning system. The 
 inhibition of growth can be carried out by applying or 
 spraying the antimicrobial agent after the odor-causing 
 microorganisms form a biofilm or by applying or spraying antimicrobial agent to prevent growth of the microorganisms before the odor-causing microorganisms form a biofilm. 
 [49] 
 [50] In another aspect, the present disclosure 
 provides a method for removing an offensive odor in an 
 air-conditioning system including isolating or removing 
 a microorganism causing offensive odors from the air 
 conditioning system. 
 [51] The removal of offensive odors includes all or 
 some of offensive odors, and the coating or spraying may 
 be performed to prevent offensive odors before the 
 offensive odors are generated. 
 [52] Various microorganisms proliferate in an air 
 conditioning system. These microorganisms can be broadly 
 classified into microorganisms causing offensive odors 
 and microorganisms not causing offensive odors. 
 Accordingly, when the antimicrobial agent acts 
 specifically only on the microorganisms causing 
 offensive odors or has inhibitory activity against the 
 growth of all or some of the dominant species of 
 microorganisms causing offensive odors, the offensive 
 odors of the air-conditioning system may be partially or 
 completely removed or improved. 
 [53] 
 [54] In another aspect, the present disclosure 
 provides a method for removing offensive odors in an 
 air-conditioning system, including isolating or removing 
 microorganisms causing offensive odors from an air 
 conditioning system. 
 [55] The microorganisms described above or 
 microorganisms including the same may be partially or 
 completely isolated or removed via a physical, chemical 
 or biological method. The physical method may be one of 
 artificially isolating or removing the aforementioned 
 microorganism or a microorganism including at least one 
 of the same using a physical apparatus. The chemical 
 method may be one of isolating or removing the 
 aforementioned microorganism or a microorganism 
 including at least one of the same using an 
 antimicrobial agent or a sterilizer against the 
 microorganism. The biological method may be one of 
 isolating or removing the microorganisms using a 
 biological agent which is toxic to the microorganisms or 
 using another microorganism which competes with the 
 microorganism for survival. However, the present 
 disclosure is not limited by these examples. 
 [56] 
 [57] In another aspect, the present disclosure 
 provides a method for removing offensive odors in an air 
 conditioning system including inhibiting growth of odor 
 causing microorganisms in the air conditioning system. 
 [Advantageous effects] 
 [58] The present disclosure provides a microorganism 
 causing offensive odors in an air-conditioning system. 
 In addition, the present disclosure provides a method 
 for screening for an antibacterial agent to control 
 microorganisms. Furthermore, the present disclosure 
 provides a method for removing offensive odors in an 
 air-conditioning system by controlling the 
 microorganisms. 
 [59] The odor-causing microorganisms in the air 
 conditioning system can be used to develop novel 
 antibacterial agents or to develop an air fresher to 
 block offensive odors by identifying the chemical 
 properties of metabolites of microorganisms. In addition, 
 the odor-causing microorganisms have various industrial 
 applicability of fundamentally removing the cause of 
 odors by previously creating an environment to prevent 
 growth of the microorganisms in the air-conditioning 
 system.

 [Best Model 
 [64] Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be 
 described in more detail with reference to examples. 
 These examples are provided only for illustration of the 
 present disclosure and it would be obvious to those 
 skilled in the art that the scope of the present 
 disclosure is not limited by the examples depending on 
 the subject matter of the present disclosure. 
 [65] 
 [66] Example 1: Selection of odor-causing dominant microorganisms 
 [67] 1. Acquisition of odorous vehicles and separation 
 of air-conditioning system 
 [68] In order to identify the cause of offensive odors 
 generated in a closed environment, like the inside of a 
 vehicle, the present inventors secured ten kinds of 
 second-hand vehicles generating offensive odors depending 
 on season (winter: February to 
 March, summer: June to July), isolated an air 
 conditioning system mounted on the respective vehicles, 
 and detached an evaporator core where a biofilm is 
 predicted to be formed by odor-causing microorganisms to 
 conduct specimen sampling (Table 1).

 [70] Example 2: Evaporator core specimen sampling 
 [71] The evaporator core samples acquired from odorous 
 second-hand vehicles 1 to 10 were sealed in a 
 polyethylene bag and refrigerated at 4°C before use. In 
 order to isolate and culture microorganisms, 5 g of 
 specimens were collected from any spots including front 
 and back parts in respective evaporator cores using 
 sterilized long nose pliers and then mixed before use 
 (FIG. 1). 
 [72] 
 [73] Example 3: Separation of microorganisms 
 [74] The microorganisms were separated from specimens 
 acquired from the evaporator cores in accordance with the 
 following process. 
 [75] 1D Specimens extracted from the evaporator cores 
 were mixed and fed into a stirrer. 
 [76] 2 Sterilized lxphosphate buffed saline (PBS) was 
 fed into a 200 ml stirrer. 
 [77] The mixed specimen was stirred with PBS for 30 
 seconds. 
 [78] 4 The stirrer was placed on ice for one minute. 
 [79] 5Steps land 4 were repeated twice. 
 [80] 6 The suspension was centrifuged at 4°C and 
 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes. 
 [81] (7) Only the supernatant was collected and 
 transferred to a new tube. 
 [82] 8 The sterilized swab was soaked with the 
 supernatant and the surface of the evaporator core, from 
 which the sample was collected, was cleaned with the swab 
 several times. 
 [83] 9 Only the head of the cleaned swab was immersed 
 in the supernatant and vortexing was conducted. 
 [84] @ The precipitate obtained in step 6 was mixed 
 with the mixture of step 9Sand the resulting mixture was 
 used as an inoculation stock. 
 [85] After steps 10 to , microorganisms were 
 separated by physical detachment from evaporator cores 
 mounted on vehicle models 1 to 10. 
 [86] 
 [87] Example 4: Separation of odor-causing 
 microorganisms and selection of dominant strains 
 [88] The separation of bacteria from the air 
 conditioner is generally carried out by performing 
 heterotrophic plate culture on aerobic heterotrophic 
 bacteria which are called general bacteria. Separation of 
 bacteria is carried out at 28 to 30°C for 14 days using 
 two complex nutrient media including PTYG agar medium and 
 R2A agar medium. In the case of PTYG agar medium, peptone 
 0.25 g (Difco), triptone 0.25 g (Difco), yeast extract 
 0.5 g (Difco), glucose 0.5 g (Difco), MgSO4 30 mg (Sigma), 
 CaC1 2 3 mg (Sigma), and Bactoagar 15g (Difco) were added 
 to 980 ml of distilled water, pH was adjusted to 7.0 and 
 the resulting mixture was autoclaved at 121°C for 15 
 minutes. In the case of R2A agar medium, yeast extract 
 0.5 g (Difco), proteose peptone No. 3 0.5 g (Difco), 
 casamino acids 0.5 g (Difco), dextrose 0.5 g (Difco), 
 soluble starch 0.5 g (Difco), sodium pyruvate 0.3 g 
 (Difco), dipotassium sulfate 0.3 g (Difco), magnesium 
 sulfate 0.05 g (Difco) and bacto agar 15 g (Difco) were 
 added to distilled water 980 ml, pH was adjusted to 7.2 
 (final: 1,000 ml) and the resulting mixture was 
 autoclaved at 121°C for 15 minutes. In order to isolate 
 non-dominant bacteria, kanamycin, ampicillin and 
 chloramphenicol were added at a concentration of 100 ppm 
 when the medium temperature reached 50 0 C after 
 sterilization of the filter, to produce antibiotic media. 
 [89] 
 [90] To separately culture dominant strains, first, 
 various dominant strains should be selected through 
 morphological approach of dilution ratio, and color, size 
 and shape of colonies and the like. 
 [91] 1 Fungi and bacteria were separately isolated 
 from the separately cultured media. 
 [92] 2 A variety of bacteria having different 
 morphologies were inoculated into a complex medium using 
 a loop and purely isolated. 
 [93] 3 The medium growing the best was selected from 
 inoculated media and passage culture was conducted. 
 [94] 4 The end of the mycelium of fungi was isolated 
 with a scalpel and inoculated into a complex medium. 
 [95] 5 In the case of fungi strains as well, the 
 medium growing the most was selected from inoculated 
 media and passage culture was conducted. 
 [96] 
 [97] 5. Identification of dominant strains 
 [98] In order to accurately identify the isolated 
 microorganisms, 16s rRNA identification including the 
 following steps was conducted. 
 [99] 
 [100] a) Investigation of fingerprints through REP-PCR 
 pattern analysis 
 [101] REP-PCR is a molecular biological method of 
 analyzing the structure of bacterial chromosomes and is a fingerprinting method which is capable of distinguishing specific bacterial strains from other bacteria. Genetic characteristics were analyzed in accordance with respective processes to conduct REP-PCR.

 [112] (3) Gel electrophoresis 
 [113] The DNA fragments amplified by PCR were collected, 
 1.2-1.5% agarose gel supplemented with EtBr was used, and 
 a mixture of 6x dye and a sample in a ratio of 1 to 5 was 
 loaded in an amount as much as possible. Since most PCR 
 products were between 100 and 1,000 bp, they were loaded 
 with a 100 bp ladder, and electrophoresis was conducted 
 as slow as possible such that the middle (50 V) of 
 bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes reached the 
 middle of the entire gel. Strains that have identical DNA 
 patterns on gel are considered to be the same strains. 
 [114] 
 [115] (b) Identification of air conditioner dominant 
 bacteria through 16S rRNA genetic analysis 
 [116] 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) genes are 
 used for identification of genetic classes of bacteria 
 and can be identified at the level of genus and species 
 of bacteria classified by REP-PCR.

 [130] The products amplified by 16S-rRNA genetic PCR 
 were purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit in 
 accordance with the following process. 
 [131] CD 5x volume of PB buffer of the PCR product was 
 added. 
 [132] The mixed solution was seeded on a QIAquick 
 column. 
 [133] For binding of DNAs, centrifugation was 
 conducted for one minute and the supernatant was removed. 
 [134] (DFor washing, 750 pl of PE buffer was placed in 
 a QIAquick column, centrifugation was conducted for one 
 minute and the supernatant was removed. 
 [135] Centrifugation was conducted again for one 
 minute. 
 [136] The QIAquick column was transferred to a new 
 tube. 
 [137] in order to extract DNAs, 30 pl of EB buffer 
 was added thereto and was allowed to stand for one minute. 
 [138] (Centrifugation was conducted for one minute to allow DNAs dissolved in EB to be collected in the tube. 
 [139] 
 [140] As a result of the test, in order to check 
 whether or not purely isolated microorganisms generate 
 odors, purely isolated microorganisms were cultured by 
 the following method and sensory evaluation was conducted. 
 [141] 1) Pure separately cultured microorganisms were 
 inoculated into a liquid nutrient medium. 
 [142] (2) The inoculated medium was cultured at 28°C for 
 to 7 days. 
 [143] 3 100 pl of the bacteria cultured in the liquid 
 medium was inoculated into a solid nutrient medium. 
 [144] (4) The inoculated bacteria was evenly spread using 
 a spreader. 
 [145] 5 A petri dish was sealed and cultured at 28°C 
 for 10 days. 
 [146] 
 [147] Sensory evaluation was conducted, based on a 5 
 grade method using seven panels, odor-causing 
 microorganisms were selected using the average after 
 evaluation of odor intensity, six dominant strains were 
 identified through identification of the 16S rRNA genetic 
 analysis, and these dominant strains were deposited at the Korea Culture Center of Microorganisms on April 17, 
 2015.

 [149] Example 2: Evaluation of antibacterial activity 
 of selected odor-causing microorganisms depending on 
 antibacterial agent 
 [150] 1. Test process 
 [151] The present inventors evaluated antibacterial 
 activity of dominant microorganisms selected in Example 1 
 using a variety of commercially available antibacterial 
 agents. The antibacterial agents used in the present 
 disclosure will be given below: 
 [152] Antibacterial agent A: Kimcare (Yuhan Kimberly, 
 Ltd.) 
 [153] Antibacterial agent B: Febreze (P&G) 
 [154] Antibacterial agent C: mass-produced 
 antibacterial agent containing methyl alcohol 45~50%, 
 chromium sulfate (CAS 10101-53-8) 1-5%, bromine 1-5% and 
 water 
 [155] 
 [156] The evaluation of antibacterial activity was 
 conducted by the following steps: 
 [157] 1OPreparing sterilized filter paper 
 [158] (2 Preparing three kinds of antibacterial agents 
 (control group: group not-treated with antibacterial 
 agent, test groups: antibacterial agent A, antibacterial 
 agent B, antibacterial agent C) 
 [159] 3 Feeding filter paper to antibacterial agent 
 [160] (4 coating respective odor-causing microorganisms 
 in a nutrient medium 
 [161] 5 placing antibacterial agent-containing filter 
 papers in odor-causing microorganisms-coated nutrient 
 medium 
 [162] Culturing at 28 to 30°C for 5 days 
 [163] 07Measuring an area of growth inhibition. 
 [164] 
 [165] Measurement of the area of growth inhibition was 
 carried out by measuring the diameter of the area of 
 growth inhibition using Vernier calipers, and the method 
 will be shown in detail in FIG. 2. 
 [166] 
 [167] 2. Test result 
 [168] An average of three diameters of the area of 
 growth inhibition obtained by testing each of six strains 
 of odor-causing microorganisms three times is shown in 
 Table 8. 
 [169] [Table 8]

 [170] (unit: cm) 
 [171] 
 [172] As shown in Table 8, antibacterial agent A 
 exhibits weaker antibacterial activity against Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, and antibacterial agent B exhibits strong antibacterial activity against Fibrella aestuarina, but weaker antibacterial activity against Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae. 
 [173] In addition, antibacterial agent C exhibits weak 
 antibacterial activity against Geobacillus toebii, but 
 exhibits stronger overall antibacterial activity against 
 six strains of microorganisms than antibacterial agents A 
 and B. 
 [174] 
 [175] Example 3: Evaluation of odors of evaporator core 
 from which odor-causing microorganisms are removed. 
 [176] In order to reproduce the evaporator core from 
 which odorous microorganisms were removed or separated, 
 the present inventors cultured a combination of odorless 
 microorganisms excluding the odorous microorganism of 
 Example 1, among dominant microorganisms grown in the 
 evaporator core, using an aluminum fin which is a 
 material for the evaporator core (Table 9, FIG. 3). 
 [177] Odorless microorganisms were selected as dominant 
 microorganisms which were grown in the evaporator core, 
 created colonies during culture and did not generate an 
 offensive odor and the culture method will be given below: 
 [178] (1 Purely isolated and cultured odorless 
 microorganisms were inoculated in R2A liquid medium. 
 [179] 2 The inoculated medium was cultured at 28°C for 
 to 7 days. 
 [180] 3 An aluminum fin which had been sterilized at a 
 high pressure at 121°C for 20 minutes was prepared. 
 [181] 4 The fin was immersed in each antibacterial 
 agent to evenly coat the surface of the fin. 
 [182] The coated aluminum fin was placed on a petri 
 dish. 
 [183] 1 ml of the cultured odorless microorganism 
 inoculation solution was centrifuged and the supernatant 
 was removed. 
 [184] (7) 1 ml of the sterilized 1 x PBS was added and 
 centrifugation was conducted again. 
 [185] 8 The method of (7) was repeated twice. 
 [186] 9 100 pl of the odorless microorganism washed 
 with PBS 100 pl was dropped in the middle of the aluminum 
 fin. 
 [187] 1 The prepared aluminum fin was inoculated with 
 microorganisms and dried at room temperature. 
 [188] 01 The petri dish was sealed and at 28°C for one month. 
 [189] 
 [190] As a result, all the combinations of the 
 following table 9 (result of odor analysis upon culture 
 of microorganisms grown in evaporator core from which 
 odorous microorganisms are removed) did not generate 
 odors after one month.

 [192] As shown in the test result described above, when 
 a combination of microorganisms not generating odors is 
 formed by removing odor-causing microorganisms grown in 
 an air-conditioning system by a chemical or physical 
 method, odors generated from the air-conditioning system can be significantly removed. 
 [193] Although the preferred embodiments of the present 
 disclosure have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, 
 those skilled in the art will appreciate that various 
 modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, 
 without departing from the scope and spirit of the 
 disclosure as disclosed in the accompanying claims.
