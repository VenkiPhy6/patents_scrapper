 Embodiment six: the applicable test of present invention degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent 
 1, ammonia nitrogen degradation effect 
 Two kinds of microbial inoculums, method preparation degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent of the A group by embodiment one, B group is arranged in this test
For simple photosynthetic bacteria fermentation liquid；Prepare 2 kinds of microbial inoculums are inoculated in the sewage of fish pond, detect ammonia of degrading in the sewage of fish pond daily
Nitrogen quantity, test result referring to shown in attached drawing 6, simple photosynthetic ferment product degradation of ammonia nitrogen in fish pond need six days or so when
Between can degradable ammonium ion, and composite bacteria agent prepared by the present invention is more more effective than simple photosynthetic bacteria degradation of ammonia nitrogen, effect
Time is shorter, and is not in repeatedly situation, because ammonia nitrogen effect drops in the degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent of the invention preparation
It is more preferably significant. 
 2, phosphate degradation effect 
 By the method preparation degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent of embodiment one, by 1kg/ mus of usage amount difference of composite bacteria agent
It is added in 2 high ammonia nitrogen pond, the dominant groups in No. 2 ponds are diatom, chrysophyceae, cyanobacteria, and No. 3 ponds are with green alga, diatom
For the pond of dominant groups.Test result is as shown in Fig. 7, by 1kg/ mus of usage amount difference of degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent
Be added 2 ponds can phosphate content in sustaining degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage pond, and its function and effect is not by algae in pond
Class influences. 
 3, nitrite degradation effect 
 By the method preparation degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent of embodiment one, by degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent
1kg/ mus of usage amounts are separately added into 2 high ammonia nitrogen pond, and the dominant groups in No. 2 ponds are diatom, chrysophyceae, cyanobacteria, and No. 3 ponds
The pool is using green alga and diatom as the pond of dominant groups.As shown in Fig. 8, make for Composite Photosynthetic Bacteria 1kg/ mus prepared by the present invention
Related with pond algae type to the degradation effect of nitrite after dosage application, No. 2 ponds production oxygen ability is weaker therefore it is applied
Raising trend is presented with rear nitrite amount, and No. 3 green alga pools production oxygen abilities are strong, therefore its content of nitrite shows more
Stable state.Therefore should be bright and clear when using composite bacteria agent of the present invention, when water body oxygen abundance, applies. 
 4, to the influence of water body pH 
 By the method preparation degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage composite bacteria agent of embodiment one, it is applied to No. 1, No. 4, No. 6 and No. 9 four
In pond, four pond situations are respectively as follows: No. 1 pond: 15 mu, depth capacity 2.5m, minimum-depth 1m, mean depth 1.5m,
Water colour is dark green, and algae is mainly based on Chlorophyta, and water quality is more stable, pH 8.0 or so, ammonia nitrogen < 0.5, and raising is mainly carp
Fish, variegated carp, grass carp amount to about 50,000 tails；No. 4 ponds: 14 mu, depth capacity 2.0m, minimum-depth 1.5m, mean depth
1.5m, water colour is partially yellow, partially thin, and algae is not enriched, mainly based on Bacillariophyta, raising predominantly carp, variegated carp, grass carp, altogether
Count about 30,000 tails；No. 6 ponds: 10 mu, depth capacity 2.0m, minimum-depth 1m, mean depth 1.5m, water colour pale green, algae master
If raising is mainly carp, variegated carp, grass carp based on green alga, Bacillariophyta, amount to about 50,000 tails；No. 9 ponds: 11 mu, most
Big depth 2.0m, minimum-depth 1m, mean depth 1.5m, water colour is partially black, partially thin algae is unstable, and raising is mainly carp, flower
Silver carp, grass carp amount to about 30,000 tails.Test result is answered referring to shown in attached drawing 9 using degradation high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage prepared by the present invention
After combined bacteria agent, various types of pond waters pH are had no and are had a significant effect, water body pH maintains essentially in 8.3 hereinafter, No. 1 pond
The raising of pH is mainly that the pH as caused by the fast-growth of Measures of Algae in Water Body is increased. 
 The bacillus subtilis from the living bacteria count that above-mentioned test result can be seen that composite bacteria agent prepared by the present invention
It is 5.70 ± 1.03 × 10 10 Cfu/ml, photosynthetic bacteria are 8.3 ± 0.82 × 10 8 Cfu/ml, and preparation process is simple, is applied to
High-ammonia-nitrogen sewage of degrading is handled, and efficiently can be converted organic nitrogen for inorganic nitrogen, is obviously improved the protrusion of wastewater treatment efficiency
Practicability has applications well prospect for the processing of high-ammonia-nitrogen sewage. 
 As described above, the present invention can be realized preferably, the above embodiments are only to preferred implementation side of the invention
Formula is described, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, and without departing from the spirit of the design of the present invention, this field is general
The various changes and improvements that logical technical staff makes technical solution of the present invention, should all fall into present invention determine that protection scope
It is interior.
