 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to the method for the carotenoid being contained zeaxanthin by fermentable manufacture. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Carotenoid is the natural pigment that can be used as feed additive, food additives, medicine etc.Carotenoid such as comprises: zeaxanthin, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, Lyeopene, phoenicoxanthin (phoenicoxanthin), ADX (adonixanthin), myoxanthin, asteroidenone and 3-hydroxyechinenon etc. 
 In carotenoid, known zeaxanthin, as the natural xanthein contained in each kind of plant such as corn, makes an addition to the purposes of yolk, meat, the purposes of epidermis tone and the tinting material as food improving the poultries such as chicken in feed.Report is also had to point out: zeaxanthin has powerful antioxygenation (non-patent literature 1) and antitumous effect (non-patent literature 2).And known zeaxanthin is present in retina and crystalline together with xenthophylls, with the health relevant (non-patent literature 3) keeping eye.Based on these physiologic effects, zeaxanthin can be used as heath food starting material, cosmetic raw materials and medicine material. 
 β-cryptoxanthin is contained in citrus, known have antitumous effect (non-patent literature 2), also report, for preventing osteoporosis disease, there is effect (non-patent literature 4), also have the purposes as heath food starting material and feed formulation agent. 
 β-carotene has provitamin A effect and antioxygenation, as widespread uses such as feed additive, food additives, natural colorants. 
 Zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin or β-carotene make an addition in the feed of the poultries such as chicken, by this feed and give poultry, then can be accumulated in yolk.Owing to having above-mentioned effective physiological action, therefore, the yolk that have accumulated these carotenoid can be used as function gamogenetic egg. 
 On the other hand, the manufacture method of zeaxanthin such as there will be a known: use optically active hydroxyketone of being obtained by the asymmetric reduction of ketoisophorone as the chemical synthesis (non-patent literature 5) of raw material and the method extracted by corn seed.The also known method (patent documentation 1) being extracted zeaxanthin by Flower of Aztec Marigold, the main component from the carotenoid of Flower of Aztec Marigold is xenthophylls, and the content of zeaxanthin is low. 
 The example producing the microorganism of zeaxanthin there will be a known: spiral algae (patent documentation 2), Nannochloropsis oceanica belongs to (Nannochloris) microalgae (patent documentation 3), Flexibacter (Flexibacter) bacterium (patent documentation 4), Alteromonas (Alteromonas) bacterium (patent documentation 5), Flavobacterium (Flavobacterium) bacterium and the orange edaphic bacillus of bacterium (Agrobacteriumaurantiacum) (non-patent literature 6).In addition, producing bacterium and in known paracoccus (Paracoccus) bacterium as carotenoid, the dissociant (patent documentation 7) of secondary coccus (Paracoccuszeaxanthinifaciens) ATCC21588 strain (non-patent literature 7) of such as known product zeaxanthin, the secondary dissociant (patent documentation 6) of coccus (Paracoccuscarotinifaciens) E-396 strain of Bacterial carotenogenic, the dissociant (patent documentation 6) of paracoccus bacterium A-581-1 strain and paracoccus bacterium produces zeaxanthin. 
 But above-mentioned zeaxanthin chemical synthesis with an organic solvent, therefore has problems in security and natural goods trend in recent years.Therefore and impracticable in addition, when producing zeaxanthin by algae culture, productivity is low.And during by plant extract zeaxanthin, because the content of zeaxanthin is low, cost is excessive, and is subject to the left and right of weather, therefore has the shortcoming being difficult to stable supplying. 
 On the other hand, although paracoccus bacterium has, rate of propagation is fast, productivity is high, extract easy etc. a little, but in nutrient solution, produce glyconic acid in a large number, cause carbon source to be wasted use, and the glyconic acid of accumulation suppresses the production of zeaxanthin, cannot the zeaxanthin of the enough concentration of cumulative production in manufacturing cost.Therefore, people's demand supply with the low cost Absorbable organic halogens of zeaxanthin in the past, manufacture method that security is high.
