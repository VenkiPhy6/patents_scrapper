 (0057) make crystallization be called possibility by supersaturation usually.Supersaturation is such situation, under this situation, is dissolved in the amount that the amount of the solute in the solvent can be held greater than solvent.For example, the solid matter that contains than multicomponent " solute A " and less impurity " solute B " (A and B have similar solubility properties) is dissolved in the hot solvent, make that solute A is saturated in the solution, and solute B is undersaturated.When making the solution cooling, it reaches a bit, and the solute A in this solution becomes oversaturated, and the crystal of solute A begins at first slowly to form.Originally crystal plays a part crystal seed, and it induces solute A further crystallization from solution, and solute B---it is not to be in saturation point---is retained in the solution.The pure crystal of solute A can be recovered then. 
 (0058) realizes supersaturation by diverse ways.Generally speaking, when saturated solution was cooled, perhaps when the solvent from solution slowly evaporated, solution began supersaturation.Other method for example adds anti-solvent (poor solvent), perhaps reduces dissolubility by adding salt NaCl or N,N-Diethylethanamine hydrochloride, perhaps the combination by any said method. 
 (0059) use that is used for crystalline neat solvent is limited, because solvent must show big dissolubility difference in narrow temperature range.Using solvent system is more flexibly.This solvent system comprises at least a good solvent (medicine has the solvent of good solubility therein) and at least a poor solvent (medicine dissolves not good solvent therein), and this poor solvent is solvable to be mixed in first kind.Solvent system generally includes a kind of good solvent and a kind of poor solvent (anti-solvent), but also can comprise two or more solvents. 
 (0060) example that is used for the good solvent of dissolved compound 1 (for example includes, without being limited to low-carbon alkyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol), acetonitrile, arsol (for example toluene) and oxygen containing organic solvent such as dialkyl ketone (for example, acetone, 2-butanone), oxolane, diox, alkyl acetate (for example, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate) and dialkyl ether (for example, t-butyl methyl ether).The example that  chemical compound  1 dissolves not good solvent therein includes, without being limited to aqueous solvent (for example water), aliphatic hydrocarbon (for example, hexane, normal heptane, isobutyltrimethylmethane .) and halogenated hydrocarbons (for example, dichloromethane, chloroform). 
 (0061) at the arbitrary steps of this method, before crystal formation, solution can be used depigmenting agent such as Norit
           TM Active carbon is handled, and filters this depigmenting agent then.Also can be by making solution through the post of the depigmenting agent step of decolouring, the post of this depigmenting agent has or does not have filtering agent such as Celite
           TM Help.Before crystallization process, when medicine is in solution, finish in the decolouring step, for example, before adding in the cosolvent system, poor solvent carries out, if perhaps solution is heated, before cooling procedure, carry out.
         
 (0062) when reaching supersaturation, the beginning crystallization.Crystal may form naturally, and perhaps this process can be by utilizing precipitant or causing by the crystal of inoculating chemical compound in solution.The slow evaporation of solvent or adding poor solvent in a small amount also can cause crystallization.PH changes or adding salt also can help this crystallization process.By comprising filtration, centrifugal and decantation or their combination collection crystal. 
 (0063) crystal is with solvate forms (comprising hydrated form when solvent is water) or with basic non-solvent compound (ansolvate) form (not or have considerably less solvent molecule and exist, not being also referred to as dehydration (anhydrate) when non-existent solvent is water in crystal structure) generation.There is preparation (being hydrone for hydrated form perhaps) under the situation of solvent in solvate forms.Dehydrated form prepares (for example, by substantially anhydrous organic solvent) by remove water from solvent system, perhaps by make hydrate crystal heat up up to remaining hydrone be removed.Therefore, the non-solvent compound form prepares in the following way: the solvent that use will can not stop in crystal structure; Use the solvent system of having got rid of solvent substantially with remaining tendency; Perhaps heating (drying) solvation crystal is removed up to remaining solvent molecule. 
 (0064) obtains the crystal of multi-form or polymorph according to the condition that is used for its preparation (for example, temperature, solvent and solvent ratios, and compound concentrations).The difference of form is the three-dimensional arrangement of molecule in the crystal, and the existence or the shortage that are water in the crystal structure and/or solvent molecule usually.These differences are by showing with the x ray powder diffraction or with optical microscopy, solid state NMR spectral method or polarized light microscope analyzing crystal.Different polymorphs has different energy and stability.By the method that---is also referred to as annealing process---such as drying and heat treatment, polymorph can change (for example, mental retardation or more stable form) with another kind of crystal form sometimes.
