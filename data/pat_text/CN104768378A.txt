 We have found that and pass through compared with control rate possible during applying formula (I) compound and composition thereof on non-cultivated plant, cultivated plant applies formula (I) compound and composition thereof (when mixture, meanwhile, namely associating or separately apply Compound I and Compound II per) or in succession apply Compound I and Compound II per) allow the control to animal pest that strengthens. 
 Plant health 
 Establish the composition that another problem of the present invention needs to improve plant health (be often called and hereinafter referred to as the process of " plant health "). 
 Therefore the object of this invention is to provide a kind of method, described method solves the problem as above-outlined and reduces delivery rate especially and/or promote plant health, especially plant products. 
 We also find and pass through compared with plant health effects possible during applying formula (I) compound and composition thereof on non-cultivated plant, cultivated plant applies formula (I) compound and composition thereof (when mixture, meanwhile, namely associating or separately apply Compound I and Compound II per) or in succession apply Compound I and Compound II per) allow the plant health effects that strengthens. 
 Term " health of plant " or " plant health " are defined as the state of plant and/or its product, described state by several aspects of independent or combination with one another as output, plant growth gesture, quality with determine abiotic stress and/or biological stress tolerance. 
 To have to emphasize when cultivated plant is not in biological coercing down and especially when cultivated plant is not under pest pressure, plant health effects mentioned above also exists.Obviously, with accept healing property or preventative process for pathomycete or any other relevant insect and compared with the cultivated plant that grows under there is not situation of the damage that can cause at biological Stress Factors, suffer the cultivated plant of fungal attack or attack of insect to produce less biomass and cause output to reduce.But, method of the present invention even without any biological coerce deposit cause in case strengthen plant health.This means that the plant health promoted can not only be explained by insect (or weeding) activity of killing of formula (I) compound and composition thereof, but based on other activity profile.Therefore, method of the present invention is also implemented under pest pressure does not exist situation. 
 Listed hereinafter and be selected from output, plant growth gesture, quality and independent or be preferably interpreted as it is the preferred embodiments of the invention in combination with each other separately to each plant health index listed by abiotic stress and/or biological stress tolerance. 
 According to of the present invention, the Product yields that " output of increase " of cultivated plant means each cultivated plant increases with measurable amount because of applying formula (I) compound and composition thereof, exceedes under the same conditions and the also output of the same products that each check plant is produced when applying formula (I) compound and composition thereof. 
 The output increased can especially by the characteristic present of the following improvement of cultivated plant: plant weight increases, plant height increases, biomass increases as higher total fresh weight (FW), the number of spending of every strain plant increases, higher seed and/or fruit yield, more tiller or side seedling (branch), larger leaf, the seedling growth increased, the protein content increased, the oil content increased, the content of starch increased, the pigment content increased, chlorophyll content (the photosynthesis rate positive correlation of chlorophyll content and plant increased, and therefore chlorophyll content is higher, plant products is higher). 
 " seed " and " fruit " will be interpreted as any cultivated plant product, described product utilizes after harvesting further, such as, fruit in appropriate meaning, vegetables, nut, grain, seed, timber are (such as, when Silvicultural), flower (such as when gardening plant, ornamental plants), it has any material of economic worth that this plant produces. 
 According to the present invention, output increase at least 4%, preferably 5% to 10%, more preferably 10% to 20% or even 20 to 30%.Usually, output increase can be even higher. 
 Another index of the situation of cultivated plant is plant growth gesture.Plant growth gesture becomes obviously as overall visual outward appearance in several. 
 The plant growth gesture improved can especially by the characteristic present of the following improvement of cultivated plant: the cultivated plant vigor of improvement, the plant growth improved, the development of plants improved, the visual appearance improved, the plant deflection (plant joint/lodging is less) improved, that improves emerges, the root growth strengthened and/or more flourishing root system, the noclulation strengthened, especially rhizobium noclulation, larger blade, larger size, the plant height increased, the tiller number increased, the number of branch increased, the number of spending of every strain plant increases, the seedling growth increased, the photosynthetic activity strengthened (such as increases and/or CO based on stomatal conductance
         2 absorption ratio increases), the pigment content strengthened, bloom more early, result more early, sprout more morning and improvement, Grain Ripening more early, ineffective tillering is less, dead basal leaf is less, the input (as fertilizer or water) needed is less, leaf is greener, complete mature in trophophase shortening situation, the seed needed is less, more easily gather in the crops, maturation faster and evenly, shelf life is longer, inflorescence is longer, old and feeble delay, stronger and/or more effectively to tiller, better constituents extraction, the seed quality (for producing in seed bearing next season and sowing) improved and/or ethene produce and reduce and/or Restraining culture plant contact ethene.
       
 Another index of cultivated plant state is cultivated plant and/or its product " quality ".According to the present invention, the quality of enhancing means certain plants feature to be increased or improvement according to mensurable or perceptible amount as the content of some composition or composition, exceedes the identical factor that check plant produces under the same conditions.The quality strengthened can especially by the characteristic present of the following improvement of cultivated plant or its product: the nutrient content of increase, the protein content increased, the content of fatty acid increased, the metabolite content increased, the carotenoid content increased, the sugar content increased, the essential amino acid amount increased, the nutrient composition improved, the protein composition improved, the fatty acid composition improved, the metabolite composition improved, the carotenoid composition improved, the sugar composition improved, the amino acid composition improved, the fruit color of improvement or the best, the leaf color improved, higher storage capacity, the processability of results product is higher. 
 Another index of cultivated plant state is plant to the tolerance of biological and/or abiotic stress factor or resistance.The biological side of body and abiotic stress, especially within the longer time, can have adverse effect to cultivated plant.Biological coercing is caused by living organism, and abiotic stress is such as caused by environmental extreme conditions.According to the present invention, " tolerance to biological and/or abiotic stress factor of enhancing or resistance " means (1.) compared with the check plant being exposed to the same terms, some unfavorable factor caused by biological and/or abiotic stress weakens with mensurable or perceptible amount, (2.) factor (I) compound and composition thereof mixture is not weakened to Stress Factors direct effect (such as because it kills insect effect) for detrimental effect, and because stimulating the defense reaction of cultivated plant self to described Stress Factors weakened. 
 Extensively known by the unfavorable factor of biotic as pathogene and insect cause and scope is damaged from spot leaf completely to cultivated plant.Biological coercing can by living organism as competitive plant (such as weeds), microorganism (as plant pathogenic fungi and/or bacterium) and/or virus cause. 
 The unfavorable factor caused by abiotic stress is also to know and can often as following and observe: the plant growth gesture (seeing above) of reduction, such as, spot leaf, " burning leaf ", growth reduce, it is less to spend, biomass is less, crop yield is less, nutritive value of crops reduction, crop maturity are more late, only give a few examples.Abiotic stress can such as by extreme temperature as heat or cold (heat stress/cold coerce), temperature strongly change, the temperature anomaly of particular season, arid (drought stress), extreme humidity, high salinity (salt stress), radiation (such as because the ultra-violet radiation caused by day by day thinning ozone layer increases), level of ozone rising (ozone stress), organic contamination (such as the agricultural chemicals of phytotoxicity amount), inorganic pollution (such as heavy metal contaminants) cause. 
 As result that is biological and/or abiotic stress factor, amount and the quality of the cultivated plant of being coerced, its crop and fruit decline.With regard to quality, reproductive ability is grown and is usually had a strong impact on by the consequence wanted that plant is overstated to fruits and seeds.Synthesis, the accumulation of protein and preserve most temperature influence; Grow because almost coercing of all types delays; Polysaccharide synthesis (no matter structural polysaccharide and storage polysaccharides) all reduces or is adjusted: these effects cause biomass (output) to decline and the nutritive value of product changes. 
 The advantageous feature obtained from processed seed be especially the sprouting that such as improves and field is set up, better growth potential and/or evenly field set up. 
 As noted above, the cultivated plant health indicator determined above can be complementary and can alternate each other.Such as, increase can cause better plant growth gesture to resistance that is biological and/or abiotic stress, such as cause better and larger crop, and therefore cause the output that increases.Conversely, more flourishing root system can cause increasing to resistance that is biological and/or abiotic stress.But these interdependencies and interaction, neither completely known, do not fully understand again, and therefore describe different indexs respectively.

 In one embodiment of the invention, term " cultivated plant " refers to the plant of modification ".In one embodiment of the invention, term " cultivated plant " refers to " genetically modified plants "." plant of modification " is those that undertaken modifying by traditional breeding method.About the plant of modifying, term " modification " mean with contrast, the change of the genome of modified plant, apparent gene group, transcript profile or Proteomics compared with wild type, female parent or mother plant, thus described modification is given certain proterties (or more than a kind of proterties) or gives as proterties (or more than a kind of proterties) listed hereinafter increases. 
 This modification can cause modify plant become different from mother plant, such as new plant variety. 
 " genetically modified plants " are those plants by utilizing recombinant DNA technology to modify its genetic material, these plants can not be obtained easily by outbreeding, sudden change or natural restructuring under natural surroundings, thus, compared with wild-type plant, modify and give certain proterties (or more than a kind of proterties) or give as proterties (or more than a kind of proterties) listed hereinafter increases. 
 In one embodiment, by one or more gene integration in the genetic material of genetically modified plant so that compared with wild-type plant, improve some characteristic of plant, preferably increase as proterties listed hereinafter.This kind of genetic modification also includes but not limited to the posttranscriptional modification of the directed posttranslational modification of protein, oligomer or polypeptide, such as, by glycosylation or add polymer as isoprenylation, acetylization, phosphorylation or farnesylation part or peg moiety. 
 In one embodiment when referring to genetically modified plants or its part, term " modification " be interpreted as with contrast, with reference to or wild-type plant or plant cell respective volume compared with, in specific volume, the activity of gene outcome, expression or amount or metabolite content change, such as increase or reduce, comprising the from the beginning generation of activity or expression. 
 In one embodiment, the activity of polypeptide increases because of the expression of the gene of coding said polypeptide or overexpression or produces, and wherein with check plant, described gene is given as proterties listed hereinafter or the increase of giving proterties.Term " expression " or " gene expression " mean transcribing of a specific gene or multiple specific gene or specific genetic constructs.Term " expression " or " gene expression " especially mean certain gene or multiple gene or gene construct and are transcribed into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA), modulability RNA (such as miRNA, RNAi, RNAa) or such mRNA, and described mRNA translates into subsequently or do not translate into protein.In another embodiment, term " expression " or " gene expression " especially mean certain gene or multiple gene or gene construct and are transcribed into structural RNA (rRNA, tRNA) or such mRNA, and described mRNA translates into subsequently or do not translate into protein.In still another embodiment, it means gene or gene or gene construct and is transcribed into mRNA. 
 This process comprises the processing with gained mRNA product of transcribing of DNA.As used herein, the term " expression of increase " or " overexpression " means relative to original wild type expression level to be that extra any form is expressed. 
 In one embodiment, term " expression of polypeptide " will be understood as the level meaning protein described in cell or biology or polypeptide, preferably activity form protein or polypeptide. 
 In one embodiment, the activity of polypeptide reduces because of the expression minimizing of the gene of coding said polypeptide, gives as proterties listed hereinafter or the increase of giving proterties than gene described in check plant.Endogenous gene expression and/or peptide level and/or the polypeptide active minimizing relative to check plant is meant to the appellation that " expression of minimizing " or " reduce or substantially eliminate " is expressed herein.It also comprises minimizing, prevents, lowers or eliminate the expression product of nucleic acid molecules. 
 Term " reduction ", " preventing ", " minimizing " or " elimination " relate to the respective change of character in biological, biological moieties is as tissue, seed, root, stem tuber, fruit, leaf, flower etc. or in cell.Under " change of character ", be appreciated that the activity of gene outcome, expression or amount or metabolite content in specific volume or in the specified quantitative of protein relative to contrast, with reference to or the respective volume of protein of wild type or amount for change.Preferably, general activity minimizing in this volume, attenuating or elimination, if when described minimizing, attenuating or elimination relate to minimizing, lower or eliminate the activity of gene outcome, no matter the amount of gene outcome or the specific activity of this gene outcome or both whether reduce, lower or eliminate or the nucleotide sequence of this gene outcome of no matter encoding or amount, the stability of gene or translate effect and whether reduce, lower or eliminate. 
 Term " minimizing ", " preventing ", " attenuating " or " elimination " comprise the change of described character only in the part of present subject matter, such as, modify the compartment that may reside in cell as in organelle or be present in the part (as tissue, seed, root, leaf, stem tuber, fruit, flower etc.) of plant, if but test whole object, i.e. intact cell or plant, then can not detect.Preferably, term " minimizing ", " preventing ", " attenuating " or " elimination " exist at cellular level, therefore term " active minimizing, attenuating or elimination " or " minimizing of metabolite content, attenuating or elimination " refer to compared with wild-type cell, Leukopenia, attenuating or elimination.In addition, term " minimizing ", " preventing ", " attenuating " or " elimination " comprise the change during the Different growth phases of the biology that described character only uses in the methods of the invention, such as, reduce, prevent, lower or eliminate only to occur during seed growth or at duration of flowering.In addition, these terms comprise of short duration reduction, minimizing or abatement, such as reason is method therefor such as antisense, RNAi, snRNA, dsRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ta-siRNA, Co inhibitor or ribozyme not stable integration in the genome of biology, or described reduction, reduce, prevent or eliminate be in adjustment type or inducible element (such as chemical induction type or other inducible promoters) control under and thus only there is of short duration effect. 
 In expression product, realize described minimizing, the method for attenuating or elimination is known in the art, such as known from international patent application WO 2008/034648, be known in [0020.1.1.1], [0040.1.1.1], [0040.2.1.1] and [0041.1.1.1] section especially.
