 Background technology 
 2, description of related art 
 5 '-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) is the foodstuff additive being widely used as flavor potentiator together with inosine monophosphate (IMP).The taste of the similar mushroom of itself known imparting of GMP, and when with monosodium glutamate (MSG) in conjunction with time increase its flavour strength.It is combined with IMP usually. 
 The example of the method for the hitherto known GMP of preparation comprises the RNA (Yeast Nucleic Acid) that (1) enzyme liberating extracts from yeast cell, (2) the direct fermentable of GMP, (3) guanosine fermentable, chemical phosphorylation subsequently, (4) guanosine fermentable, Enzymatic Phosphorylation subsequently, (5) xanthosine 5 '-monophosphate (XMP) fermentable, GMP is changed into subsequently by corynebacterium strain, (6) XMP fermentable, changes XMP into GMP by intestinal bacteria (Escherichia coli) subsequently.In them, method (1) has the difficulty of limited materials supply and is unhelpful economically, and method (2) is subject to because the membrane permeability of GMP has the shortcoming of low-yield.Therefore, additive method is widely used in industrial application. 
 In the above-mentioned methods, when GMP produces by changing XMP into GMP, require to increase XMP productivity or the ATP being used as cofactor between GMP tour without interruption.In order to increase XMP productivity, ordinary method produces resistance to guanosine or XMP microorganism by sudden change.Such as, Korean Patent Application No. 10-1991-018061 discloses XMP deaminase (aminase) the nonactive bacterial strain can producing XMP with high yield, it is half auxotrophic for VITAMIN B4 and guanine, tolerance guanosine analogue to N,O-Diacetylmuramidase-a kind of enzyme destroying cell walls---very responsive.In addition, Korean Patent Application No. 10-2001-000513 discloses and can directly gather the bacterial strain of the corynebacterium ammoniagenes (Corynebacterium ammoniagenes) of XMP with high density in the medium and utilize it to produce the method for XMP, wherein bacterial strain is by following preparation: with the female microorganism of UV rayed, process with mutagenic compound N-methyl-N '-nitro-N nitrosoguanidine (NTG), and select the mutant of tolerance norvaline, described norvaline is for affect the biosynthetic valine analogue of XMP.In addition, Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-006537 describes the method increasing XMP productive rate, wherein relates to biosynthetic purN and the purH gene of XMP and is modified. 
 As mentioned above, for being changed into by XMP for GMP, key is the ATP that supply is used as cofactor between GMP tour.Most of ATP of GMP is changed into by producing the supply of XMP bacterial strain for XMP.In this method of converting, dimethylbenzene adds the membrane permeability of ATP and XMP, and adds to substratum the bacterial strain that dimethylbenzene allows ATP and XMP infiltration product GMP, changes XMP into GMP subsequently.Therefore, the method that GMP produces takes the strategy increasing ATP productivity. 
 Change GMP into from XMP to be represented by following reaction formula: 
 XMP+ATP+NH
         3 ------------------>GMP+AMP+PPi
       
 XMP deaminase 
 That is, be necessary as ATP without interruption of cofactor for transition process, wherein first XMP is produced and subsequently by adding the enzyme with XMP deaminase activity to the substratum comprising XMP and microorganism or microorganism changes GMP into.Therefore, it is very important for improving the ATP productivity of producing XMP bacterial strain.The AMP produced in transition process is used as the substrate of ATP production again.In fact, adeninyl nucleotide pair is produced in the ATP in transition process is circulation. 
 Therefore, it is necessary that the improvement of XMP productivity produces productive rate to the height of GMP, and can improve XMP productivity by increasing ATP productivity.Based on this background, the present inventor has done a lot of effort to develop the method increasing ATP productivity.As a result, they find that the proline dehydrogenase activity improved is by increasing the ATP production loading production productive rate of XMP and GMP. 
 Therefore, the present inventor identifies and is responsible for improving the gene that XMP produces productive rate, devises the carrier comprising this gene, and has prepared the microorganism of the corynebacterium utilizing this vector, and they find XMP or GMP can high yield by microorganisms producing, complete the present invention thus.
