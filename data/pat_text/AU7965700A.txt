More specifically, the present invention relates to the process for increasing crop yield and biomass by transforming a host crop with a recombinant vector containing Protox gene 10 through enhancing photosynthetic capacity of the crop, the recombinant vectors, the recombinant vector-host crop system, and uses of the recombinant vectors and the recombinant vector-host crop system. BACKGROUND ART 15 Protox which catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, is the last common enzyme in the biosynthesis of both heme and chlorophylls. Chlorophylls are light-harvesting pigments in photosynthesis and thus essential factor associated with photosynthetic capacity and ultimate yield. Thus far, many attempts have 20 been made to increase crop yield through enhancing photosynthetic efficiency; i.e., CO 2 enrichment for increasing photosynthetic capacity [Malano et al., 1994; Jilta et al., 1997], foliar spray of the porphyrin pathway precursor S-aminolevulinic acid for enhancing chlorophyll biosynthesis and thus crop yield [Hotta et al., 1997], and manipulation of gene encoding phytochrome for enhancing photosynthetic efficiency [Clough et al., 1995; Thile 25 et al., Plant Physiol. 1999]. However, these attempts have not been commercialized by demanding both high cost and labor, and possible unexpected side effects inhibiting the crop growth. To date, a dozen of Protox genes have been cloned and characterized from Escherichia coli, yeast, human, and plants, each of which shares low amino acid identities WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 2 among different organisms, but high homology between closely related families [Dailey et al., 1996; Lermontova et al., 1997; Corrigall et al., 1998]. Although Bacillus subtilis Protox has similar kinetic characteristics to the eukaryotic enzyme which possesses a flavin and employs molecular oxygen as an electron 5 acceptor, it is capable of oxidizing multiple substrates, such as protoporphyrinogen IX and coproporphyrinogen III. Since B. subtilis Protox has less substrate specificity than eukaryotic Protox, B. subtilis Protox can catalyze the reaction using the substrate for the porphyrin pathway of plants when it is transformed into plants [Dailey et al., 1994]. Protox enzyme has been studied with an emphasis on the weed control and 10 conferring crop selectivity to herbicides [Matringe et al., 1989; Choi et al., 1998; U.S. Patent No. 5,767,373 (June 16, 1998); U.S. Patent No. 5,939,602 (August 17, 1999)]. However, no discussion has been made with Protox in relation to the stimulation of plant growth. 15 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION To determine whether the optimal expression of B. subtilis Protox gene in plant cytosol or plastid stimulates the porphyrin pathway leading to the enhanced biosynthesis of chlorophylls and phytochromes and thereby increases the photosynthetic capacity of crops, 20 the present inventors developed transgenic rice plant expressing B. subtilis Protox gene via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and examined their growth characteristics in To,  
 T 
 1 , and T 2 generations. As a result, they found that the yield and biomass of transgenic rice were considerably increased as a consequence of vector-host plant system, and completed the present invention. 25 Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a process for increasing crop yield or biomass by transforming a host crop with a recombinant vector containing Protox gene, preferably, B. subtilis Protox gene, through enhancing photosynthetic capacity of the crop. The present invention includes also the recombinant vectors, the recombinant vector-host crop system, and uses of the recombinant vectors and the recombinant vector- WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 3 host crop system. First, the present invention provides a process for increasing crop yield and biomass by transforming a host crop with a recombinant vector containing Protox gene. In the present process, said gene is preferably a prokaryotic gene and more preferably, a 5 gene from Bacillus or intestinal bacterium. In addition, preferably, said recombinant vector has ubiquitin promoter and is targeted to cytosol or plastid of a host plant. Second, the present invention provides a recombinant vector comprising Protox gene, ubiquitin promoter, and hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker. Said Protox gene is preferably isolated from B. subtilis. 10 Third, the present invention provides A. tumefaciens transformed with the above described recombinant vector, in particular, an A. tumefaciens LBA4404/ pGA1611:C (KCTC 0692BP) or an A. tumefaciens LBA4404/pGA161 1:P (KCTC0693BP). Fourth, the present invention provides a plant cell transformed with the above described A. tumefaciens. The plant cell may be a monocotyledon; for example, barley, 15 maize, wheat, rye, oat, turfgrass, sugarcane, millet, ryegrass, orchardgrass, and rice or be a dicotyledon; for example, soybean, tobacco, oilseed rape, cotton, and potato. Fifth, the present invention provides a plant regenerated from the above-described plant cell. Sixth, the present invention provides a plant seed harvested from the above 20 described plant. The development of transgenic plant expressing a B. subtilis Protox gene in To, T 1 , and T 2 generations will be described hereunder. However, the present invention is not limited to specific plants (e.g., rice, barley, wheat, ryegrass, soybean, potato). One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the present invention is also applicable to not only 25 other monocotyledonous plants (e.g., maize, rye, oat, turfgrass, sugarcane, millet, orchardgrass, etc.) but also other dicotyledonous plants (e.g., tobacco, oilseed rape, cotton, etc.). Therefore, it should be understood that any transgenic plant using the recombinant vector-host crop system of the present invention lies within the scope of the present invention. 
 WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 4 Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail. Transgenic rice plants expressing B. subtilis Protox gene via Agrobacterium mediated transformation are regenerated from hygromycin-resistant callus. Integration of B. subtilis Protox gene into plant genome, its expression in cytosol 5 or plastid and inheritance are investigated by using DNA, RNA, Western blots, and other biochemical analyses in To, T 1 , and T 2 generations of the transgenic rice. In the present invention, a Protox gene from Bacillus is preferable as a gene source although a Protox gene from an intestinal bacterium such as Escherichia coli can be used. In addition, a recombinant vector having ubiquitin promoter is preferable. Since B. 10 subtilis Protox has similar substrate specificity to eukaryote Protox and expression of a gene from a microorganism of which codon usage is considerably different from plant gene is known to be very low [Cheng et al., 1998], it is believed that the combination of ubiquitin promoter, a regulatory gene for transgene overexpression in rice, and B. subtilis Protox gene of which expression is expected to be low in a plant due to its different codon 15 usage from plant gene is favorable for an optimal expression of B. subtilis Protox gene in a plant. If Arabidopsis Protox gene is expressed in the plastid of a plant using the same recombinant vector as in the present invention, the transgene expression would be much higher compared to the case using B. subtilis Protox gene or much lower due to the genetic homology of Protox between Arabidopsis and rice. In any cases, using the recombinant 20 vector containing B. subtilis Protox gene is confirmed to result in excellent yield in transgenic rice (see the following table). Table.

Therefore, the optimal expression level of B. subtilis Protox gene is essential for increasing 5 crop yield. Crop yield may be greatly increased by artificial synthesis of B. subtilis Protox gene, introduction of appropriate copy number into a plant genome, and optimal expression of the transgene using various promoters [e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, rice actin promoter]. 10 Table.

As the copy number of the introduced B. subtilis Protox gene is increased, its 20 expression level is increased. As the amount of B. subtilis Protox mRNA is increased due to the increased copy number of the transgene, the yield increasing effect is reduced. These observations are set forth in the following table.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION 25 The specific methods for the present invention are explained hereunder. 
 WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 7 However, the methods used in the invention and those in the literatures cited can be modified appropriately. PCR cloning of the transit sequence from tobacco Protox 5 The sequence information of PCR-fished transit sequence showed a 189 nucleotides in length with 63 amino acids which has 11 amino acids longer than those of the reported tobacco Protox [Lermontova et al. 1997]. Both deduced amino acid sequences were almost identical except the 12 consecutive stretch of serine residues in PCR-fished transit peptide (Figure 1). However, the sequence variation seemed to be 10 ascribed to the different cultivar of tobacco plants used as a template. The sequence had the common properties of transit peptide such as the richness of Ser/The and the deficiency of Asp/Glu/Tyr [von Heijne et al., 1989]. Transformation vector construction 15 There are numerous binary vectors available for transforming monocotyledonous plants, especially for rice. Almost all the binary vectors can be obtained from international organizations such as CAMBIA (Center for the Application of Molecular Biology to International Agriculture, GPO Box 3200, Canberra ACT2601, Australia) and university institutes. Transformant selectable marker, promoter, and terminator gene 20 flanked by left or right border region of Ti-plasmid can be widely modified from the basic skeleton of a binary vector. Although pGA1611 [Kang et al., 1998] as a binary vector is used in Examples of the present invention, other vectors which are able to express Protox gene efficiently can be used without any particular limitation. The binary vectors of pCAMBIA 1380 T-DNA 25 and pCAMBIA 1390 T-DNA may be suitable examples, since they have a close structural similarity to pGA1611 in the present invention and can be provided by the CAMBIA. 
 WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 8 Transformation of rice Transformation can be routinely conducted with conventional techniques. Plant transformation can be accomplished by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and the techniques described in previous literature [Paszkowsky et al., 1984] can be used. For 5 example, transformation techniques of rice via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation are described in previous literature [An et al., 1985]. Transformation of monocotyledonous plants can be accomplished by direct gene transfer into protoplasts using PEG or electroporation techniques and particle bombardment into callus tissue. Transformation can be undertaken with a single DNA species or multiple DNA species (i.e., co 10 transformation). These transformation techniques can be applicable not only to dicotyledonous plants including tobacco, tomato, sunflower, cotton, oilseed rape, soybean, potato, etc. but also to monocotyledonous plants including rice, barley, maize, wheat, rye, oat, turfgrass, millet, sugarcane, ryegrass, orchardgrass, etc. The transformed cells are regenerated into whole plants using standard techniques. 15 Three gene constructs of pGA1611, pGA1611:C, and pGA1611:P were employed to transform plants using the known molecular biology techniques. These gene constructs were subcloned into a binary vector pGA1611 harboring a constitutive ubiquitin promoter which is known to be appropriately expressed in plants and have hygromycin phosphotransferase as a selectable marker and transformed into A. tumefaciens LBA4404. 20 The scutellum-derived calli from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nakdong) seeds were co cultivated with the A. tumefaciens harboring the above constructs. On average, 10-15% calli were survived from the selection medium containing 50 tg/ml hygromycin. After transferring onto a regeneration medium, selected calli were regenerated into shoots at a rate of 1-5%. During the process of regeneration, some young shoots emerged from the 25 plastid targeted lines (pGA1611:P) were inclined to be etiolated under normal light intensity. However, this phenomenon could be overcome by growing them under dim light condition for 1 week and subsequently transferring them under normal light condition, in which the shoots began to grow normally without being etiolated. It can be explained that these transgenic lines due to the possible overexpression of the B. subtilis Protox gene WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 9 in the plastid are oxidizing protoporphyrinogen IX into protoporphyrin IX, which is required for the downstream metabolic process, leading to phototoxicity to plant cells (data not shown). On the whole, 6 and 58 different transgenic rice lines having pGA1611:C and pGA1611:P constructs expressed in the cytosol or in the plastid, respectively, were 5 grown to maturity. As a control, a transgenic rice expressing pGA1611 vector was also grown to maturity. Most of the transgenic lines appeared to have normal phenotypes, but their seed production varied ranging from 4 to 260 seeds depending on the individual transgenic lines. 10 Genomic DNA gel blot analysis To assess the stable integration of the B. subtilis Protox gene into the rice genome of the transgenic lines regenerated from the hygromycin selection medium, DNA was extracted separately from 5 transgenic lines of cytosol targeted (pGA1611 :C) and 6 transgenic lines of plastid targeted (pGA1611:P), digested with HindIII, and hybridized 15 with 32 P-labeled B. subtilis Protox gene. Due to the absence of HindIII site within the probed transgene, the number of hybridized bands directly corresponded to the copy number of the transgene in genome of the transgenic lines. The cytosol targeted transgenic lines (C2, C5, and C6) showed the multiple bands around three hybridizing bands each above 5 kb in size, suggestive of multiple insertions of the transgene at 20 different locations in the rice genome (data not shown). In contrast, lines C8 and C13 had a single copy insertion in the rice genome. As for the plastid targeted transgenic lines, 5 out of 6 plastid targeted transgenic lines had a single copy insertion except the line P21 showing a three-copy insertion (data not shown). 25 Segregation of hygromycin-resistant trait in transgenic rice of T 1 generation Seeds from the self-pollinated individual transgenic rice plants of To generation were separately collected for evaluating the segregation of hygromycin-resistant trait in T 1 generation. Five transgenic rice lines including 1 transgenic control (Tc), 2 cytosol targeted lines (C8 and C13), and 2 plastid targeted lines (P9 and P21) were employed in WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 10 this evaluation. The seeds were germinated on 1/2 strength MS medium containing 50 [Lg/ml hygromycin and their survival rates from the medium were recorded for evaluating the segregation of hygromycin-resistant trait. Results are set forth in the following table 1. 5 Table 1. Segregation of hygromycin-resistant trait in transgenic rice in T 1 generation. Transgenic rice Resistant Sensitive Segregation ratio 2 Tc 18 7 3:1 0.12 C8 19 16 - C13 22 13 3:1 2.75 P9 13 7 3:1 1.07 P21 16 4 3:1 0.27 Segregation ratios of hygromycin-resistant to sensitive were close to 3:1 in all the transgenic rice lines examined except in line C8, suggesting that the transgene in the rice genome was expressed according to the Mendelian inheritance. In line C8, however, 10 hygromycin-sensitive seeds were found at a high rate. RNA blot analysis of transgenic rice in T 1 generation Individuals of transgenic rice lines survived from the medium containing hygromycin (1 transgenic control, Tc; 2 cytosol targeted transgenic lines, C8 and C13; and 15 2 plastid targeted transgenic lines, P9 and P21) were transplanted into a paddy field. B. subtilis Protox mRNA was not detected in total RNA isolated from the leaves of control (C) and transgenic control (Tc) line (Figure 2). In the cytosol targeted transgenic lines, C8 and C13 expressed relatively high levels of the B. subtilis Protox mRNA. The plastid targeted transgenic lines were able to transcribe efficiently the B. subtilis Protox gene, in 20 which line P21 exhibited the highest level of the transgene expression. In the light of some relevance between the copy number of transgene and the relative mRNA expression level, the level of the B. subtilis Protox mRNA expression appeared to be associated with the copy number of the transgene in the rice genome. As the copy number of the introduced B. subtilis Protox gene was increased, its expression 25 level was increased (Figure 2: Transgenic T 1 mRNA blot assay). As the amount of the B. 
 WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 11 subtilis Protox mRNA was increased due to the increased copy number of the transgene, the yield increasing effect was reduced (see the above table relating to growth characteristics of transgenic rice according to the copy number of the transgene in T 1 generation). 5 Detection of B. subtilis Protox polypeptides Production of B. subtilis Protox protein in transgenic rice of T 1 generation was immunologically examined by using a polyclonal antibody against B. subtilis Protox (source, Rohm and Haas Co.). Soluble proteins were extracted from the leaves of the 10 transgenic rice lines (1 transgenic control, Tc; 2 cytosol targeted transgenic lines, C8 and C13; and 2 plastid targeted transgenic lines, P9 and P21) and electroblotted from gels to PVDF membranes. Subsequent immunodetection of polypeptides on the blot with the antibody against B. subtilis Protox was performed according to standard procedures. Proteins corresponding to B. subtilis Protox in size were detected in all the transgenic rice 15 lines examined except the transgenic control. Interestingly, the plastid targeted transgenic lines exhibited 3- to 4-fold higher band intensity than the cytosol targeted lines. Two small protein bands which might be degradation products of B. subtilis Protox were detected in the transgenic lines. In contrast, faint band larger than B. subtilis Protox by ca. 4-5 kDa was also detected only in 20 the plastid targeted transgenic lines. This band was probably proprotein of B. subtilis Protox with non-deleted transit sequence. The antibody-reactive proteins were not detected in microsomal proteins (data not shown). In conclusion, the detection of degradation products of B. subtilis Protox in the transgenic lines, higher band intensity in the plastid targeted transgenic lines than in the 25 cytosol targeted transgenic lines, and the presence of proprotein of B. subtilis Protox indirectly provide strong evidences for the expression of B. subtilis Protox in the transgenic lines. 
 WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 12 DNA and RNA blot analysis of transgenic rice in T 2 generation Seeds collected from transgenic rice plants of T 1 generation were germinated and routinely transplanted into a paddy field. Forty plants in each transgenic line were cultivated in the field. At 5 weeks after transplanting, leaves from individual transgenic 5 plants were separately collected to examine the transgene expression according to necrosis response of the leaf segments in distilled water containing 100 mg/l hygromycin. The hygromycin-resistant transgenic lines were analyzed whether the B. subtilis Protox gene was stably expressed in T 2 generation. As the same as in T 1 generation, B. subtilis Protox was found to be expressed in the cytosol targeted transgenic lines (C8 and C13) and in the 10 plastid targeted transgenic lines (P9 and P21) of T 2 generation, but not in control and transgenic control [Figure 4(A)]. Stable expression of the introduced B. subtilis Protox gene in T 2 generation was confirmed by RNA blot analysis. The levels of B. subtilis Protox mRNA expression were different among the cytosol targeted transgenic lines (C8, C13-1, and C13-2) and between the plastid targeted transgenic lines (P9 and P21) [Figure 15 4(B)]. In addition, the transgenic line (Figure 4, C 13-1) having higher expression level of B. subtilis Protox gene was found to have reduced yield increase by 5-10% compared to the transgenic line (Figure 4, C13-2) having the optimal expression level of B. subtilis Protox gene. 20 The present invention will be specifically explained by reference to the following representative examples. However, these examples are merely illustrative of, and are not intended to limit the present invention in any manner. 25 EXAMPLE 1: Construction of transformation vector for rice Two types of B. subtilis Protox gene constructs were used for transforming rice. pGA1611 vector as a starting binary vector was constructed as follows; hygromycin resistant gene [Gritz and Davies, 1983; NCBI accession No., K01193] as an antibiotic resistant gene, CaMV 35S promoter [Gardner et al., 1981); Odell et al., 1985; NCBI WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 13 accession No., V00140] which regulates hygromycin-resistant gene, and termination region of transcription in the 7t transcript of octopine-type TiA6 plasmid [Greve et al., 1982; NCBI accession No., V00088] for terminating transcription were inserted into a cosmid vector pGA482 [An et al., 1988]. Ubiquitin gene [Christensen et al., 1992; NCBI 5 accession No., S94464] was introduced at BamHI/PstI site for expressing foreign gene and the termination region of transcription of nopaline synthase gene [Bevan et al., 1983; NCBI accession No., V00087] was placed at the cloning region having unique restriction enzyme site (HindIl, SacI, HpaI, and KpnI). A plasmid pGA1611:C was constructed to express the B. subtilis Protox gene in 10 the cytosol. The full length of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified B. subtilis Protox gene was digested with Sad and KpnI and ligated into pGA1611 binary vector predigested with the same restriction enzymes resulting in placing the Protox gene under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. The other construct, pGA1611:P, was designed to target the B. subtilis Protox gene into the plastid (Figure 1). Sad primer site 15 designed for the convenient subcloning was underlined. Sequence of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN) Protox was derived from GenBank database (accession No., Y13465). For constructing vector, PCR strategy was employed using specific primers which were designed according to the sequence data of tobacco (N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN) 20 Protox. The transit peptide was amplified using the forward primer harboring a HindIII site (underlined) 5'-d(TATCAAGCTTATGACAACAACTCCCATC)-3', a reverse primer 5'-d(ATTGGAGCTCGGAGCATCGTGTTCTCCA)-3' harboring a Sad site (underlined), and tobacco (N. tabacum cv. KY160) genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and SacI, gel purified, and ligated into the same restriction sites 25 within the pBluescript (commercially available). After verifying the sequence integrity, the HindIII and Sad fragment of transit sequence was ligated into the same restriction enzyme sites of pGA1611:C vector leading to the construction of pGA1611:P which had placed transit peptide in front of the B. subtilis Protox gene. Figure 1 illustrates schematic diagram of T-DNA region in binary vector. The abbreviations used in Figure 1 WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 14 are as follows; Ubi, maize ubiquitin; Tnos, nopaline synthase 3' termination signal; P 35 s, CaMV 35S promoter; HPT, hygromycin phosphotransferase; Ts, transit sequence. EXAMPLE 2: Transformation and regeneration of rice 5 A. tumefaciens LBA4404 harboring pGA1611, pGA1611:C, and pGA1611:P were grown overnight at 28C in YEP medium (1% Bacto-peptone, 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 5 ptg/ml tetracyclin and 40 tg/ml hygromycin. The cultures were spun down and pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of AA medium [Hiei et al., 1997] containing 100 tM acetosyringone. The calli were induced from 10 scutellum of rice (cv. Nakdong) seeds on N6 medium [Rashid et al., 1996; Hiei et al., 1997]. The compact calli of 3- to 4-week-old were soaked in the bacterial suspension for 3 minutes, blotted dry with sterile filter paper to remove excess bacteria. The calli were transferred to a co-culture medium and then cultured for 2-3 days in darkness at 25'C. The co-cultured calli were washed with sterile distilled water containing 250 mg/l 15 cefotaxime. The calli were transferred to N6 medium containing 250 mg/l cefotaxime and 50 mg/l hygromycin. After selection for 3-4 weeks, the calli were transferred to a regeneration medium for shoot and root development. After the roots had sufficiently developed, the transgenic plants were transferred to a greenhouse and grown to maturity. A. tumafecians transformed with pGA1611:C and pGA1611:P vectors in the 20 present invention have been deposited in an International Depository Authority under the Budapest Treaty (Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 52 Oun-dong, Yusong-ku, Taejon 305-333, Korea) on November 15, 1999 as KCTC 0692BP and KCTC 0693BP, respectively. 25 EXAMPLE 3: Transformation and regeneration of soybean A. tumefaciens LBA4404 harboring pGA1611, pGA1611:C, and pGA1611:P were grown overnight at 28"C in YEP medium (1% Bacto-peptone, 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) supplemented with 5 p.g/ml tetracyclin and 40 pg/ml hygromycin. The cultures were spun down and pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of B5 medium WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 15 [Gamborg et al. 1968] containing 100 pM acetosyringone. Cotyledon tissues which were longitudinally wounded were co-cultured with the bacterial suspension for 3 days at 24'C. The co-cultured calli were transferred to B5 recovery medium and a regeneration medium [Di et al., 1996] for the generation of To soybean. 5 EXAMPLE 4: Construction of transformation vector for barley, wheat, ryegrass, and potato From pGA1611:C and pGA1611:P binary vectors, the genes including ubiquitin promoter, B. subtilis Protox gene, and 3' termination region of nopaline synthase gene 10 were digested with BamHIClaI and ligated into the same restriction enzyme site within pBluscript II SK cloning vector (Strategene, USA) leading to the construction of pBSK Protox vectors. Region of CaMV 35S promoter:hygromycin-resistant gene:termination region of transcription in octopine-type TiA6 plasmid was digested from pGA1 611: C with ClaI/SalI and ligated within pBSK-Protox vector leading to the construction of pBSK 15 Protox/hygromycin vector as a vector for transformation using a gene gun. EXAMPLE 5: Transformation and regeneration of barley, wheat, ryegrass, and potato Scutellum-derived calli were used as explants for the transformation of barley, 20 wheat, and ryegrass [Spangenberg et al., 1995; Koprek et al., 1996; Takumi and Shimada, 1997], whereas cotyledon tissues were used for the transformation of potato. The pBSK Protox/hygromycin vector DNAs coated with 1.6-ptm diameter gold particles were bombarded into the explants of barley, wheat, ryegrass, and potato by using a biolistic PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). B. subtilis Protox protein from the 25 transformed plants was extracted in 1 ml of homogenization medium consisting of 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mM P-mercaptoethanol, and 1 tablet/10 ml of complete protease inhibitors [Complete Mini; Boehringer Mannheim] at 4 0 C. The homogenate was filtered through 2 layers of Miracloth (CalBiochem) and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 minutes to obtain crude WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 16 microsomal pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 100 pl of the homogenization buffer. The resuspended pellet of 20 tg protein was used for immunoblotting against microsomal fraction, whereas the 100,000 g supernatant of 15 tg protein was used as soluble protein. Both soluble and microsomal proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate 5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10% (w/v) acrylamide/bis gel. Following the electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted to PVDF membranes and subsequently immunodetected with a polyclonal antibody against B. subtilis Protox. The application of secondary antibody and band detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's protocol (ECL Kit; Boehringer 10 Mannheim). TEST 1: Growth results of transgenic rice Seeds from transgenic rice plants which were regenerated in Example 2 were collected and the hygromycin-resistant seedlings were transplanted into a paddy field. 15 The growth results of the transgenic rice are shown in Tables 2 to 5.

TEST 2: Growth results of transgenic barley, wheat, soybean, Italian ryegrass, and potato 15 The growth characteristics of the transgenic monocotyledonous plants (barley, WO 01/26458 PCT/KROO/01133 18 wheat), dicotyledonous plants (soybean, potato), and forage crop (Italian ryegrass) which were all regenerated similarly as in Example 2 were examined. Grain yield increase by 18-27% was observed in the transgenic barley (Table 6). Grain yield increases by 14 25% and 23-28% were observed in the transgenic wheat (Table 7) and soybean (Table 8), 5 respectively. In the case of the transgenic Italian ryegrass, shoot fresh weight was increased by up to 51% (Table 9). Table 10 shows yield characteristics of transgenic potato. Both shoot and tuber fresh weights were increased by 13-18%. These results demonstrate that yield increase effect by B. subtilis Protox gene can be widely applicable not only to monocotyledonous plants including rice but also to forage crops and 10 dicotyledonous plants.
