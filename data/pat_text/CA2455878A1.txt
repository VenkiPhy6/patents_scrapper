Numerous of these compounds are prepared by fermentation from strains of coryneform bacteria, in particular Corynebacterium glutamicum. Because of their great importance, work is constantly being undertaken to improve the preparation processes. Improvements to the process can relate to fermentation measures, such as, for example, stirring and supply of oxygen, or the composition of the nutrient media, such as, for example, the sugar concentration during the fermentation, or the working up to the product form by, for example, ion exchange chromatography, or the intrinsic output properties of the microorganism itself.      Methods of mutagenesis, selection and mutant selection are used to improve the output properties of these microorganisms. Strains which are resistant to antimetabolites or are auxotrophic for metabolites of regulatory importance and which produce the particular compounds are obtained in this manner.      Methods of the recombinant DNA technique have also been employed for some years for improving the strain of Corynebacterium strains, by amplifying individual biosynthesis genes and investigating the effect on production.      A common method comprises amplification of certain biosynthesis genes in the particular microorganism by means of episomally replicating plasmids. This procedure has the disadvantage that during the fermentation, which in industrial processes is in general associated with numerous generations, the plasmids are lost spontaneously (segregational instability).      Another method comprises duplicating certain biosynthesis genes by means of plasmids which do not replicate in the particular microorganism. In this method, the plasmid, including the cloned biosynthesis gene, is integrated into the chromosomal biosynthesis gene of the microorganism (Reinscheid et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60(1), 126-132 (1994); Jetten et al., Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 43(1):76-82 (1995)). A disadvantage of this method is that the nucleotide sequences of the plasmid and of the antibiotic resistance gene necessary for the selection remain in the microorganism. This is a disadvantage, for example, for the disposal and utilization of the biomass. Moreover, the expert expects such strains to be unstable as a result of disintegration by "Campbell type cross over" in a corresponding number of generations such as are usual in industrial fermentations.      Object of the Invention The inventors had the object of providing new measures for improved fermentative preparation chemical compounds using coryneform bacteria.

Detailed Description of the Invention 5 Chemical compounds are to be understood, in particular, as meaning amino acids, vitamins, nucleosides and nucleotides.      The biosynthesis pathways of these compounds are known and are available in the prior art.      Amino acids mean, preferably, L-amino acids, in particular the proteinogenic L-amino acids, chosen from the group consisting of L-aspartic acid, L-asparagine, L-threonine, L-serine, L-glutamic acid, L-glutamine, glycine, L-alanine, L-cysteine, L-valine, L-methionine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, L-histidine, L-lysine, L-tryptophan, L-proline and L-arginine and salts thereof, in particular L-lysine, L-methionine and L-threonine. L-Lysine is very particularly preferred.      Proteinogenic amino acids are understood-as meaning the amino acids which occur in natural proteins, that is to say in proteins of microorganisms, plants, animals and humans.      Vitamins mean, in particular, vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxines), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), nicotinic acid/nicotinamide, vitamin M (folic acid) and vitamin E (tocopherol) and salts thereof, pantothenic acid being preferred.      Nucleosides and nucleotides mean, inter alia, S-adenosyl-methionine, inosine-5'-monophosphoric acid and guanosine-5'-monophosphoric acid and salts thereof.      The coryneform bacteria are, in particular, those of the genus Corynebacterium. Of the genus Corynebacterium, the species Corynebacterium glutamicum, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes are preferred. Information on the taxonomic classification of strains of this group of bacteria is to be found, inter alia, in Kampfer and Kroppenstedt (Canadian Journal of Microbiology 42, 989-1005 (1996)) and in US-A-5,250,434.      Suitable strains of the species Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) are, in particular, the known wild-type strains Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 Corynebacterium acetoglutamicum ATCC15806 Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum ATCC13870 Corynebacterium lilium ATCC15990 Corynebacterium melassecola ATCC17965 Corynebacterium herculis ATCC13868 Arthrobacter sp. ATCC243 Brevibacterium chang-fua ATCC14017 Brevibacterium flavum ATCC14067 Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 Brevibacterium divaricatum ATCC14020 Brevibacterium taipei ATCC13744 and Microbacterium ammoniaphilum ATCC21645 and mutants or strains, such as are known from the prior art, produced therefrom which produce chemical compounds.      Suitable strains of the species Corynebacterium ammoniagenes (C. ammoniagenes) are, in particular, the known wild-type strains Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ATCC6871 Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ATCC15137 and Corynebacterium sp. ATCC21084 and mutants or strains, such as are known from the prior art, produced therefrom which produce chemical compounds.  
  Suitable strains of the species Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes (C. thermoaminogenes) are, in particular, the known wild-type strains Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes FERM BP-1539 Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes FERM BP-1540 Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes FERM BP-1541 and Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes FERM BP-1542 and mutants or strains, such as are known from the prior art, produced therefrom which produce chemical compounds.      Strains with the designation "ATCC" can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).      Strains with the designation "FERM" can be obtained from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba Ibaraki, Japan). The strains of Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes mentioned (FERM BP-1539, FERM BP-1540, FERM BP-1541 and FERM BP-1542) are described in US-A 5,250,434.      Open reading frame (ORF) describes a section of a nucleotide sequence which codes or can code for a protein or polypeptide or ribonucleic acid to which no function can be assigned according to the prior art.      After assignment of a function to the nucleotide sequence section in question, it is in general referred to as a gene.      Alleles are in general understood as meaning alternative forms of a given gene. The forms are distinguished by differences in the nucleotide sequence.      In the context of the present invention, endogenous, that is to say species-characteristic, open reading frames, genes or alleles are preferably used. These are understood as meaning the open reading frames, genes or alleles or nucleotide sequences thereof present in the population of a species, such as, for example, Corynebacterium glutamicum. "A copy of an open reading frame (ORF), a gene or allele present at the natural site (locus)" in the context of this invention is understood as meaning the position or situation of the ORF or gene or allele in relation to the adjacent ORFs or genes or alleles such as exists in the corresponding wild-type or corresponding parent organism or starting organism.      Thus, for example, the natural site of the lysC gene or of an lysCFBR allele, which codes for a "feed back" resistant aspartate kinase from Corynebacterium glutamicum is the lysC site or lysC locus or lysC gene site with the directly adjacent genes or open reading frames orfX and leuA on one flank and the asd gene on the other flank. "Feed back" resistant aspartate kinase is understood as meaning aspartate kinases which, compared with the wild-type form, have a lower sensitivity to inhibition by mixtures of lysine and threonine or mixtures of AEC (aminoethylcysteine) and threonine or lysine by itself or AEC by itself. Strains which produce L-lysine typically contain such "feed back" resistant or desensitized aspartate kinases.      The nucleotide sequence of the chromosome of Corynebacterium glutamicum is known and can be found in Patent Application EP-A-1108790 and Access Number (Accession No.) AX114121 of the nucleotide sequence databank of the European Molecular Biologies Laboratories (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany and Cambridge, UK). The nucleotide sequences of orfX, the leuA gene and the asd gene have the Access Numbers AX120364 (orfX), AX123517 (leuA) and AX123519 (asd).  
  Further databanks, such as, for example, that of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, Nm, USA) or that of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Swissprot, Geneva, Switzerland) or that of the Protein Information Resource Database (PIR, Washington, DC, USA) can also be used. "In each case a second, optionally third or fourth site" is understood as meaning a site which differs from the "natural site". It is also called a "target site" or "target sequence" in the following. It can also be called an "integration site" or "transformation site". This second, optionally third or fourth site, or the nucleotide sequence present at the corresponding sites, is preferably in the chromosome and is in general not essential for growth and for production of the desired chemical compounds.      To produce the coryneform bacteria according to the invention, the nucleotide sequence of the desired ORF, gene or allele, optionally including expression and/or regulation signals, is isolated and provided with nucleotide sequences of the target site at the ends, these are then transferred into the desired coryneform bacterium, preferably with the aid of vectors which do not replicate or replicate to only a limited extent in coryneform bacteria, and those bacteria in which the desired ORF, gene or allele is incorporated at the target site are isolated, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics remaining at the target site. The invention accordingly also provides a process for the production of coryneform bacteria which produce one or more chemical compounds, which comprises a) isolating the nucleotide sequence of at least one desired ORF, gene or allele, optionally including the expression and/or regulation signals, b) providing the 5' and the 3' end of the ORF, gene or 5 allele with nucleotide sequences of the target site, c) preferably incorporating the nucleotide sequence of the desired ORF, gene or allele provided with nucleotide sequences of the target site into a vector which does not replicate or replicates to only a 10 limited extent in coryneform bacteria, d) transferring the nucleotide sequence according to b) or c) into coryneform bacteria, and e) isolating coryneform bacteria in which the nucleotide sequence according to a) is incorporated at the target site, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics remaining at the target site.      Preferably, also, no residues of sequences of the vectors used or species-foreign DNA, such as, for example, restriction cleavage sites, remain at the target site. A maximum of 24, preferably a maximum of 12, particularly preferably a maximum of 6 nucleotides of such DNA upstream or downstream of the ORF, gene or allele incorporated optionally remain at the target site.      By the measures according to the invention, the productivity of the coryneform bacteria or of the fermentative processes for the preparation of chemical compounds is improved in respect of one or more of the features chosen from the group consisting of concentration (chemical compound formed, based on the unit volume), yield (chemical compound formed, based on the source of carbon consumed) and product formation rate (chemical compound formed, based on the time) by at least 0.5 - 1.0~ or at least 1.0 to 1.5~ or at least 1.5~- 2.0o.      Instructions on conventional genetic engineering methods, such as, for example, isolation of chromosomal DNA, plasmid DNA, handling of restriction enzymes etc., are found in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Instructions on transformation and conjugation in coryneform bacteria are found, inter alia, in Thierbach et al. (Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 29, 356-362 (1988)), in Schafer et a1. (Journal of Bacteriology 172, 1663-1666 (1990) and Gene 145, 69-73 (1994)) and in Schwarzer and Piihler (Bio/Technology 9, 84-87 (1991)).      Vectors which replicate to only a limited extent are understood as meaning plasmid vectors which, as a function of the conditions under which the host or carrier is cultured, replicate or do not replicate. Thus, a temperature-sensitive plasmid for coryneform bacteria which can replicate only at temperatures below 31°-C has been described by Nakamura et al. (US-A-6,303,383).      The invention furthermore provides coryneform bacteria, in particular of the genus Corynebacterium, which produce L lysine, characterized in that these have, in addition to at least one of the copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of lysine production present at the natural site (locus), in each case a second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele in question at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site in integrated form, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence.which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics being present at the particular second, optionally third or fourth site.   The invention also furthermore provides a process for the preparation of L-lysine, which comprises the following steps: a) fermentation of coryneform bacteria, in particular Corynebacterium glutamicum, characterized in that these have, in addition to at least one of the copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of lysine production present at the natural site (locus), in each case a second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele in question at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site in integrated form, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics being present at the particular second, optionally third or fourth site, under conditions which allow expression of the said open reading frames (ORF), genes or alleles, b) concentration of the L-lysine in the fermentation broth, c) isolation of the L-lysine from the fermentation broth, optionally d) with constituents from the fermentation broth and/or the biomass to the extent of > (greater than) 0 to 100.      A "copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of lysine production" is to be understood as meaning all the, preferably endogenous, open reading frames, genes or alleles of which enhancement/over-expression can have the effect of improving lysine production. Enhancement is understood as meaning an increase in the intracellular concentration or activity of the particular gene product, protein or enzyme.      These include, inter alia, the following open reading frames, genes or alleles: accBC, accDA, cstA, cysD, cysE, cysH, cysK, cysN, cysQ, dapA, dapB, dapC, dapD, dapE, dapF, ddh, dps, eno, gap, gap2, gdh, gnd, lysC, lysCF$R, lysE, msiK, opcA, oxyR, ppc, ppcFBR, pgk, pknA, pknB, pknD, pknG, ppsA, ptsH, ptsI, ptsM, pyc, pyc P458S, sigC, sigD, sigE, sigH, sigh, tal, thyA, tkt, tpi, zwal, zwf and zwf A213T.      These are summarized and explained in Table 1.      These include, in particular, the lysCFBR alleles which code for a "feed back" resistant aspartate kinase. Various lysCFBR alleles are summarized and explained in Table 2.      The following lysCFBR alleles are preferred: lysC A279T (replacement of alanine at position 279 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID NO: 2, by threonine), lysC A279V (replacement of alanine at position 279 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID NO: 2, by valine), lysC S301F (replacement of serine at position 301 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID NO: 2, by phenylalanine), lysC T308I (replacement of threonine at position 308 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID N0: 2, by isoleucine), lysC S301Y (replacement of serine at position 308 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ    ID NO: 2, by tyrosine), lysC G345D (replacement of glycine at position 345 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID N0: 2, by aspartic acid), lysC R320G (replacement of arginine at position 320 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID N0: 2, by glycine), lysC T311I (replacement of threonine at position 311 of.the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ  
  ID N0: 2, by isoleucine), lysC S381F (replacement of serine at position 381 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID N0: 2, by phenylalanine).      The lysCF$R allele lysC T311I (replacement of threonine at position 311 of the aspartate kinase protein coded, according to SEQ ID N0: 2, by isoleucine), the nucleotide sequence of which is shown as SEQ ID N0:3, is particularly preferred; the amino acid sequence of the aspartate kinase protein coded is shown as SEQ ID N0:4.      The second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of lysine production in question can be integrated at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site. The following open reading frames, genes or nucleotide sequences, inter alia, can be used for this: aecD, ccpAl, ccpA2, citA, citB, citE, fda, gluA, gluB, gluC, gluD, luxR, luxS, lysRl, lysR2, lysR3, menE, mqo, pck, pgi, poxB and zwa2, in particular the genes aecD, gluA, gluB, gluC, gluD and pck. These are summarized and explained in Table 3.      The sites mentioned include, of course, not only the coding regions of the open reading frames or genes mentioned, but also the regions or nucleotide sequences lying upstream which are responsible for expression and regulation, such as, for example, ribosome binding sites, promoters, binding sites for regulatory proteins, binding sites for regulatory ribonucleic acids and attenuators. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-800, 1-600, 1-400, 1-200, 1-100 or 1-50 nucleotides upstream of the coding region. In the same way, regions lying downstream, such as, for example, transcription terminators, are also included. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-400, 1-200, 1-100, ~.-50 or 1-25 nucleotides downstream of the coding region.      Intergenic regions in the chromosome, that is to say nucleotide sequences without a coding function, can furthermore be used. Finally, prophages or defective phages contained in the chromosome can be used for this.      A prophage is understood as meaning a bacteriophage, in particular the genome thereof, where this is replicated 5 together with the genome of the host and the formation of infectious particles does not take place. A defective phage is understood as meaning a prophage, in particular the genome thereof, which, as a result of various mutations, has lost the ability to form so-called infectious 10 particles. Defective phages are also called cryptic.      Prophages and defective phages are often present in integrated form in the chromosome of their host. Further details exist in the prior art, for example in the textbook by Edward A. Birge (Bacterial and Bacteriophage Genetics, 15 3rd ed., Springer-Verlag, New York, USA, 1994) or in the textbook by S. Klaus et al. (Bakterienviren, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Jena, Germany, 1992).

coryneform bacteria which produce L-lysine, which comprises a) isolating the nucleotide sequence of at least one desired ORF, gene or allele of lysine production, optionally including the expression and/or regulation signals, b) providing the 5' and the 3' end of the ORF, gene or allele of lysine production with nucleotide sequences of the target site, c) preferably incorporating the nucleotide sequence of the desired ORF, gene or allele provided with nucleotide sequences of the target site into a vector which does not replicate or replicates to only a limited extent in coryneform bacteria, d) transferring the nucleotide sequence according to b) 5 or c) into coryneform bacteria, and e) isolating coryneform bacteria in which the nucleotide sequence according to a) is incorporated at the target site, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no 10 nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics remaining at the target site.      The invention furthermore provides coryneform bacteria, in 15 particular of the genus Corynebacterium, which produce L-methionine and/or L-threonine, characterized in that these have, in addition to at least one of the copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of methionine production or threonine production present at the natural 20 site (locus), in each case a second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele in question at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site in integrated form, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in 25 microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics being present at the particular second, optionally third or fourth site.   The invention also furthermore provides a process for the preparation of L-methionine and/or L-threonine, which comprises the following steps: a) fermentation of coryneform bacteria, in particular Corynebacterium glutamicum, characterized in that these have, in addition to at least one of the copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of methionine production or threonine production present at the natural site (locus), in each case a second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele in question at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site in integrated form, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics being present at the particular second, optionally third or fourth site, under conditions which allow expression of the said open reading frames (ORF), genes or alleles, b) concentration of the L-methionine and/or L-threonine in the fermentation broth, c)~ isolation of the L-methionine and/or L-threonine from the fermentation broth, optionally d) with constituents from the fermentation broth and/or the biomass to the extent of > (greater than) 0 to 100.      A "copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of methionine production" is to be understood as meaning all the, preferably endogenous, open reading frames, genes or alleles of which enhancement/over-expression can have the effect of improving methionine production.      These include, inter alia, the following open reading frames, genes or alleles: accBC, accDA, aecD, cstA, cysD, cysE, cysH, cysI~, cysN, cysQ, dps, eno, fda, gap, gap2, gdh, gnd, glyA, hom, homFBR, lysC, lysCF$R, metA, metB, metE, metes, metY, msiK, opcA, oxyR, ppc, ppcFBR, pgk, pknA, pknB, pknD, pknG, ppsA, ptsH, ptsI, ptsM, pyc, pyc P458S, sigC, sigD, sigE, sigH, sigh, tal, thyA, tkt, tpi, zwal, zwf and zwf A213T, These are summarized and explained in Table 4.      These include, in particular, the lysCFBR alleles which code for a "feed back" resistant aspartate kinase (see Table 2) and the hom~BR alleles which code for a "feed back" resistant homoserine dehydrogenase.      The second, optionally third or fourth copy of the opera. reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of methionine production in question can be integrated at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site. The following open reading frames, genes or nucleotide sequences, inter alia, can be used for this: brnE, brnF, brnQ, ccpAl, ccpA2, citA, citB, citE, ddh, gluA, gluB, gluC, gluD, luxR, luxS, lysRl, lysR2, lysR3, menE, metD, metK, pck, pgi, poxB and zwa2.      These are summarized, and explained in Table 5.      The sites mentioned include, of course, not only the coding regions of the open reading frames or genes mentioned, but also the regions or nucleotide sequences lying upstream which are responsible for expression and regulation, such as, for example, ribosome binding sites, promoters, binding sites for regulatory proteins, binding sites for regulatory ribonucleic acids and attenuators. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-800, 1-600, 1-400, 1-200, 1-100 or 1-50 nucleotides upstream of the coding region. In the same way, regions lying downstream, such as, for example, transcription terminators, are also included. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-400, 1-200, 1-100, 1-50 or 1-25 nucleotides downstream of the coding region.      Intergenic regions in the chromosome, that is to say nucleotide sequences without a coding function, can furthermore be used. Finally, prophages or defective phages contained in the chromosome can be used for this.

AX127146 A "copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of threonine production" is to be understood as meaning all the open reading frames, genes or alleles of which enhancement/over-expression can have the effect of improving threonine production.      These include, inter alia, the following open reading frames, genes or alleles: accBC, accDA, cstA, cysD, cysE, cysH, cysI, cysN, cysQ, dps, eno, fda, gap, gap2, gdh, gnd, hom, homFBR, lysC, lysCFBR, msiK, opcA, oxyR, ppc, ppcFBR, pgk, pknA, pknB, pknD, pknG, ppsA, ptsH, ptsI, ptsM, pyc, pyc P458S, sigC, sigD, sigE, sigH, sigh, tal, thyA, tkt, tpi, thrB, thrC, thrE, zwal, zwf and zwf A213T. These are summarized and explained in Table 6. These include, in particular, the lysCFBR alleles which code for a "feed back" resistant aspartate kinase (See Table 2) and the homF$R alleles which code for a "feed back" resistant homoserine dehydrogenase.      The second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (0RF), gene or allele of threonine production in question can be integrated at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site. The following open reading frames, genes or nucleotide sequences, inter alia, can be used for this: ccpAl, ccpA2, citA, citB, citE, ddh, gluA, gluB, gluC, gluD, glyA, ilvA, ilvBN, ilvC, ilvD, luxR, luxS, lysRl, lysR2, lysR3, mdh, menE, metA, metD, pck, poxB, sigB and zwa2. These are summarized and explained in Table 7.      The sites mentioned include, of course, not only the coding regions of the open reading frames or genes mentioned, but also the regions or nucleotide sequences lying upstream which are responsible for expression and regulation, such as, for example, ribosome binding sites, promoters, binding sites for regulatory proteins, binding sites for regulatory ribonucleic acids and attenuators. These regions in general lie in a range of ~.-800, 1-600, 1-400, 1-200, 1-100 or 1-'50 nucleotides upstream of the coding region. In the same way, regions lying downstream, such as, for example,. transcription terminators, are also included. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-400, 1-200, 1-100, 1-50 or 5 1-25 nucleotides downstream of the coding region.      Intergenic regions in the chromosome, that is to say nucleotide sequences without a coding function, can furthermore be used. Finally, prophages or defective phages contained in the chromosome can be used for this.

The invention furthermore provides coryneform bacteria, in particular of the genus Corynebacterium, which produce L-valine, wherein these have, in addition to at least one of the copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of valine production present at the natural.. site (locus), in each case a second, optionally third. or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele in question at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site in integrated form, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics being present at the particular second, optionally third or fourth site.      The invention also furthermore provides a process for the preparation of L-valine, which comprises the following steps: a) fermentation of coryneform bacteria, in particular Corynebacterium glutamicum, characterized in that these have, in addition to at least one of the copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of valine production present at the natural site (locus), in each case a second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele in question at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site in integrated form, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables episomal replication in microorganisms, no nucleotide sequence which is capable of/enables transposition and no nucleotide sequence which imparts resistance to antibiotics being present at the particular second, optionally third or fourth site, under conditions which allow expression of the said open reading frames (ORF), genes or alleles, b) concentration of the L-valine in the fermentation broth, c) isolation of the L-valine from the fermentation broth, optionally d) with constituents from the fermentation broth and/or the biomass to the extent of > (greater than) 0 to 100.      A "copy of an open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of valine production" is to be understood as meaning all the open reading frames, genes or alleles of which enhancement/over-expression can have the effect of improving valine production.      These include, inter alia, the following open reading frames, genes or alleles: brnE, brnF, brnEF, cstA, cysD, dps, eno, fda, gap, gap2, gdh, ilvB, ilvN, ilvBN, ilvC, ilvD, ilvE msiK, pgk, ptsH, ptsl, ptsM, sigC, sigD, sigE, sigH, sigh, tpi, zwal. These are summarized and explained in Table 8. These include in particular the acetolactate synthase which codes for a valine-resistant.      The second, optionally third or fourth copy of the open reading frame (ORF), gene or allele of threonine production in question can be integrated at in each case a second, optionally third or fourth site. The following open reading frames, genes or nucleotide sequences, inter alia, can be used for this: aecD, ccpAl, ccpA2, citA, citB, citE, ddh, gluA, gluB, gluC, gluD, glyA, ilvA, luxR, lysRl, lysR2, lysR3, pang, panC, poxB and zwa2. These are summarized and explained in Table 9.      The sites mentioned include, of course, not only the coding regions of the open reading frames or genes mentioned, but also the regions or nucleotide sequences lying upstream which are responsible for expression and regulation, such as, for example, ribosome binding sites, promoters, binding sites for regulatory proteins, binding sites for regulatory ribonucleic acids and attenuators. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-800, 1-600, 1-400, 1-200, 1-100 or 1-50 nucleotides upstream of the coding region. In the same way, regions lying downstream, such as, for example, transcription terminators, are also included. These regions in general lie in a range of 1-400, 1-200, 1-100, 1-50 or 1-25 nucleotides downstream of the coding region.      Intergenic regions in the chromosome, that is to say 5 nucleotide sequences without a coding function, can furthermore be used. Finally prophages or defective phages contained in the chromosome can be used for this.

A plasmid with the aid of which the incorporation of the pyc allele into the pck gene can be achieved is shown in Figure 6. It carries the name pKl8mobsacBpckl_3.      The coryneform bacteria produced according to the invention can be cultured continuously or discontinuously in the batch process (batch culture) or in the fed batch (feed process) or repeated fed batch process (repetitive feed process) for the purpose of production of chemical compounds. A summary of known culture methods is described in the textbook by Chmiel (Biopro~esstechnik 1. Einfiihrung in die Bioverfahrenstechnik (Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1991)) or in the textbook by Storhas (Bioreaktoren and periphere Einrichtungen (Vieweg Verlag, Braunschweig/Wiesbaden, 1994)).      The culture medium to be used must meet the requirements of the particular strains in a suitable manner. Descriptions of culture media for various microorganisms are contained in the handbook "Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology" of the American Society for Bacteriology (Washington D.C., USA, 1981).     Sugars and carbohydrates, such as e.g. glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, maltose, molasses, starch and cellulose, oils and fats, such as e.g. soya oil, sunflower oil, groundnut oil and coconut fat, fatty acids, such as e.g. palmitic acid, stearic acid and linoleic acid, alcohols, such as e.g. glycerol and ethanol, and organic acids, such as e.g. acetic acid or lactic acid, can be used as the source of carbon. These substances can be used individually or as a mixture.      Organic nitrogen-containing compounds, such as peptones, yeast extract, meat extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, Soya bean flour and urea, or inorganic compounds, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium nitrate, can be used as the source of nitrogen. The sources of nitrogen can be used individually or as a mixture.      Phosphoric acid, potassium dihydrogen phosphate or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate or the corresponding sodium-containing salts can be used as the source of phosphorus.      The culture medium must furthermore comprise salts of metals, such as e. g. magnesium sulfate or iron sulfate, which are necessary for growth. Finally, essential growth substances, such as amino acids and vitamins, can be employed in addition to the above-mentioned substances.      Suitable precursors can moreover be added to the culture medium. The starting substances mentioned can be added to the culture in the form of a single batch, or can be fed in during the culture in a suitable manner.      Basic compounds, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or aqueous ammonia, or acid compounds. such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid, can be employed in a suitable manner to control the pH of the culture.      An.tifoams, such as e.g. fatty acid polyglycol esters, can be employed to control the development of foam. Suitable substances having a selective action, such as e.g.     antibiotics, can be added to the medium to maintain the stability of plasmids. To maintain aerobic conditions, oxygen or oxygen-containing gas mixtures, such as e.g. air, are introduced into the culture. The temperature of the 5 culture is usually 20~C to 45~C, and preferably 25pC to 40°-C. Culturing is continued until a maximum of the desired chemical compound has formed. This target is usually reached within 10 hours to 160 hours.      It has been found that the coryneform bacteria according to 10 the invention, in particular the coryneform bacteria which produce L-lysine, have an unexpectedly high stability. They were stable for at least 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, preferably at least 50-60, 60-70, 70-80 and 80-90 generations or cell division cycles. 15 The following microorganisms have been deposited:      The strain Corynebacterium glutamicum DSM12866g1u::lysC was deposited in the form of a pure culture on 5th June 2002 under number DSM15039 at the Deutsche Sammlung fu.r Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ = German Collection 20 of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.      The plasmid pKl8mobsacBglul 1 was deposited in the form of a pure culture of the strain E. coli DH5amcr/pKl8mobsacBglul 1 (_ 25 DHSalphamcr/pKl.BmobsacBglul_1) on 20th April 2001 under number DSM14243 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.      The plasmid pKl8mobsacBaecD1_1 was deposited in the form of 30 a pure culture of the strain E. coli DHSamcr/pKl8mobsacBaecD1_1 (_ DHSalphamcr/pKl8mobsacBaecD1 1) on 5th June 2002 under number DSM15040 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.      Example 1 Incorporation of a second copy of the lysCFBR allele into the chromosome of the strain DSM13994 and of the strain The Corynebacterium glutamicum strain DSM13994 was produced by multiple, non-directed mutagenesis, selection and mutant selection from C. glutamicum ATCC13032. The strain is resistant to the lysine analogue S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine and has a feed back-resistant aspartate kinase which is insensitive to inhibition by a mixture of lysine and threonine (in each case 25 mM). The nucleotide sequence of the lysCF$R allele of this strain is shown as SEQ ID      N0:3. It is also called lysC T311I in the following. The amino acid sequence of the aspartate kinase protein coded is shown as SEQ ID N0:4. A pure culture of this strain was deposited on 16th January 2001 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ = German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.      The strain DSM12866 was produced from C. glutamicum ATCC13032 by non-directed mutagenesis and selection of the mutants with the best L-lysine accumulation. It is methionine-sensitive. Growth on minimal medium comprising L-methionine can be re-established by addition of threonine. This strain has the wild-type form of the lysC gene shown as SEQ ID N0:1. The corresponding amino acid sequence of the wild-type aspartate kinase protein is shown as SEQ ID N0:2. A pure culture of this strain was deposited on 10th June 1999 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.     1.1 Isolation and sequencing of the DNA of the lysC allele of strain DSM13994 From the strain DSM13994, chromosomal DNA is isolated by the conventional methods (Eikmanns et al., Microbiology 140: 1817 - 1828 (1994)). With the aid of the polymerase chain reaction, a DNA section which carries the lysC gene or allele is amplified. On the basis of the sequence of the lysC gene known for C. glutamicum (Kalinowski et al., Molecular Microbiology, 5 (5), 1197 - 1204 (1991);      Accession Number X57226), the following primer oligonucleotides were chosen for the PCR: lysClbeg (SEQ ID No: 5): 5~ TA(G GAT CC)T CCG GTG TCT GAC CAC GGT G 3~ lysC2end: (SEQ ID NO: 6): 5~ AC(G GAT CC)G CTG GGA AAT TGC GCT CTT CC 3~    The primers shown are synthesized by MWG Biotech and the PCR reaction is carried out by the standard PCR method of Innis et al. (PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Academic Press). The primers allow amplification of a DNA section of approx. 1.7 kb in length, which carries the lysC gene or allele. The primers moreover contain the sequence for a cleavage site of the restriction endonuclease BamHI, which is marked by parentheses in the nucleotide sequence shown above.      The amplified DNA fragment of approx. 1.7 kb in length which carries the lysC allele of the strain DSM13994 is identified by electrophoresis in a 0.8~ agarose gel, isolated from the gel and purified by conventional methods (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen, Hilden).      Ligation of the fragment is then carried out by means of the Topo TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands, Cat. Number K4600-01) in the vector pCRII-TOPO. The ligation batch is transformed in the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on kanamycin (50 mg/1)-containing LB agar with X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl ~i-D-galactopyranoside, 64 mg/1) .      The plasmid obtained is checked by means of restriction cleavage, after isolation of the DNA, and identified in agarose gel. The resulting plasmid is called pCRIITOPOlysC.      The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA fragment or PCR product is determined by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 74:5463-5467 (1977)) using the "ABI Prism 377" sequencing apparatus of PE Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt, Germany). The sequence of the coding region of the PCR product is shown in SEQ ID No:3.      The amino acid sequence of the associated aspartate kinase protein is shown in SEQ ID N0:4.      The base thymine is found at position 932 of the nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the lysCFBR allele of strain DSM13994 (SEQ ID N0:3). The base cytosine is found at the corresponding position of the wild-type gene (SEQ ID      N0:1) .      The amino acid isoleucine is found at position 311 of the amino acid sequence of the aspartate kinase protein of strain DSM13994 (SEQ ID No:4). The amino acid threonine is found at the corresponding position of the wild-type protein (SEQ ID No:2).      The lysC allele, which contains the base thymine at position 932 of the coding region and accordingly codes for an aspartate kinase protein which contains the amino acid isoleucine at position 311 of the amino acid sequence, is called the lysCFBR allele or lysC T311I.in the following.     The plasmid pCRIITOPOlysC, which carries the lysCFBR allele lysC T311I, was deposited in the form of a pure culture of the strain E. coli TOP 10/pCRIITOPOlysC under number DSM14242 on 20th April 2001 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty. 1.2 Construction of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBglul_1 The Cor'ynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC13032 is used as the donor for the chromosomal DNA. From the strain ATCC13032, chromosomal DNA is isolated using the conventional methods (Eikmanns et al., Microbiology 140: 1817 - 1828 (1994)). With the aid of the polymerase chain reaction, a DNA fragment which carries the gluB gene and surrounding regions is amplified. On the basis of the sequence of the gluABCD gene cluster known for C. glutamicum (Kronemeyer et al., Journal of Bacteriology, 177: 1152 - 1158 (1995)) (Accession Number X81191), the following primer oligonucleotides are chosen for the PCR: gluBgll (SEQ ID N0: 7): 5~ TA(A GAT CT)G TGT TGG ACG TCA TGG CAA G 3~ gluBgl2 (SEQ ID N0: 8): 5~ AC(A GAT CT)T GAA GCC AAG TAC GGC CAA G 3~      The primers shown are synthesized by MTnIG Biotech and the PCR reaction is carried out by the standard PCR method of Innis et al. (PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Academic Press). The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment of approx 1.7 kb in size, which carries the gluB gene and surrounding regions. The surrounding regions are a sequence section approx. 0.33 kb in length upstream of the gluB gene, which represents the 3' end of the gluA gene, and a sequence section approx. 0.44 kb in length downstream of the gluB gene, which represents the 5' end of the gluC gene. The primers moreover contain the sequence for the cleavage site of the restriction endonuclease BgIII, which is marked by parentheses in the nucleotide sequence shown above. 5 The amplified DNA fragment of approx. 1.7 kb in length which carries the gluB gene and surrounding regions is identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8~ agarose gel and isolated from the gel and purified by conventional methods (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen, Hilden). 10 Ligation of the fragment is then carried out by means of the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands, Cat. Number K4600-O1) in the vector pCRII-TOPO. The ligation batch is transformed in the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Selection of plasmid-15 carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on kanamycin (50 mg/1)-containing LB agar with .X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl ~i-D-galactopyranoside, 64 mg/1).      The plasmid obtained is checked by means of restriction 20 cleavage, after isolation of the DNA, and identified in agarose gel. The resulting plasmid is called pCRII-TOPOglu.      The plasmid pCRII-TOPOglu is cleaved with the restriction enzyme BglII (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and after separation in an agarose gel (0.8~) with the aid of 25 the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the gluB fragment of approx. 1.7 kb is isolated from the agarose gel and employed for ligation with the mobilizable cloning vector pKl8mobsacB described by Schafer et a1. (Gene 14: 69-73 (1994)), This is cleaved beforehand with 30 the restriction enzyme BamHI and dephosphoryl.ated with alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline Phosphatase, Boehringer Mannheim), mixed with the gluB fragment of approx. 1.7 kb, and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA Lipase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).     The E. coli strain DH5a, (Grant et al.; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 87 (1990) 4645-4649) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanahan, In. DNA      Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989). Selection of plasmid-carrying cells~is made by plating out the transformation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A      Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which is supplemented with 50 mg/1 kanamycin.      Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid is called pKl8mobsacBglul.      Plasmid DNA was isolated from the strain DSM14242 (see Example 1.1), which carries the plasmid pCRIITOPOlysC, and cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany), and after separation in an agarose gel (0.8~) with the aid of the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the lysCF$R-containing DNA fragment of approx. 1.7 kb in length was isolated from the agarose gel and employed for ligation with the vector pKl8mobsacBglul described above. This is cleaved beforehand with the restriction enzyme BamHI, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline Phosphatase, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), mixed with the lysCF~R fragment of approx. 1.7 kb and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA Ligase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).      The E. coli strain DH5amcr (Life Technologies GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanahan, In: DNA Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989).      Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratflry Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which was supplemented with 50 mg/1 kanamycin.      Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid is called pKlBmobsacBglul 1. A map of the plasmid is shown in Figure 1.      The plasmid pKl8mobsacBglul 1 was deposited in the form of a pure culture of the strain E. coli DHSamcr/pKl8mobsacBglul_1 (_ DH5alphamcr/pKl8mobsacBglul 1) under number DSM14243 on 20.04.2001 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty. 1.3 Incorporation of a second copy of the lysCF$R allele lysC T311I into the chromosome (target site: gluB gene) of the strain DSM13994 by means of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBglul_1 The vector pKl8mobsacBglul 1 described in Example 1.2 is transferred by the protocol of Schafer et al. (Journal of Microbiology 172: 1663-1666 (1990)) into the C. glutamicum strain DSM13994 by conjugation. The vector cannot replicate independently in DSM13994 and is retained in the cell only if it has integrated into the chromosome. Selection of clones or transconjugants with integrated pKl8mobsacBglul 1 is made by plating out the conjugation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which is supplemented with 15 mg/1 kanamycin and 50 mg/1 nalidixic acid. Kanamycin-resistant transconjugants are plated out on LB agar plates with 25 mg/1 kanamycin and incubated for 48 hours at 33°C.     For selection of mutants in which excision of the plasmid has taken place as a consequence of a second recombination event, the clones are cultured for 20 hours in LB liquid medium and then plated out on LB agar with 10~ sucrose and incubated for 48 hours.      The.plasmid pKl8mobsacBglul_1, like the starting plasmid pKl8mobsacB, contains, in addition to the kanamycin resistance gene, a copy of the sacB gene which codes for levan sucrase from Bacillus subtilis. The expression which can be induced by sucrose leads to the formation of levan sucrase, which catalyses the synthesis of the product" levan, which is toxic to C. glutamicum. Only those clones in which the integrated pKlBmobsacBglul_1 has excised as the consequence of a second recombination event therefore grow on LB agar. Depending on the position of the second recombination event, after the excision the second copy of the lysCFBR allele manifests itself in the chromosome at the gluB locus, or the original gluB locus of the host remains.      Approximately 40 to 50 colonies are tested for the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin". Approximately 20 colonies which show the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin" are investigated with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. A DNA fragment which carries the gluB gene and surrounding regions is amplified here from the chromosomal DNA of the colonies. The same primer oligonucleotides as are described in Example 1.2 for the construction of the integration plasmid are chosen for the PCR. gluBgll (SEQ ID N0: 7): 5~ TA(A GAT CT)G TGT TGG ACG TCA TGG CAA G 3~ gluBgl2 (SEQ ID N0: 8): 5' AC(A GAT CT)T GAA GCC AAG TAC GGC CAA G 3~     The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment approx. 1.7 kb in size in control clones with the original gluB locus. In clones with a second copy of the lysCFBR allele in the chromosome at the gluB locus, DNA fragments with a size of approx. 3.4 kb are amplified.      The amplified DNA fragments are identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8o agarose gel.      A clone which, in addition to the copy present at the lysC locus, has a second copy of the lysCF~ allele lysC T311I at the gluB locus in the chromosome was identified in this manner. This clone was called strain DSM13994g1u::lysC. 1.4 Incorporation of a second copy of the lysC gene in the form of the lysCF$R allele lysC T311I into the chromosome (target site: gluB gene) of the strain DSM12866 by means of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBglul 1 As described in Example 1.3, the plasmid pKl8mobsacBglul 1 is transferred into the C. glutamicum strain DSM12866 by conjugation. A clone which, in addition to the copy of the wild-type gene present at the lysC locus, has a second copy of the lysC gene in the form of the lysCFBR allele lysC      T311I at the gluB locus in the chromosome was identified in the manner described in 1.3. This clone was called strain DSM12866g1u::lysC.    The Corynebacterium glutamicum strain according to the invention which carries a second copy of an lySCF$R allele in the gluB gene was deposited in the form of a pure culture of the strain Corynebacterium glutamicum DSM12866g1u::lysC on 5th June 2002 under number DSM15039 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty.     1.5 'Construction of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBpckl_1 The Corynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC13032 is used as the donor for the chromosomal DNA. From the strain 5 ATCC13032, chromosomal DNA is isolated using the conventional methods (Eikmanns et al., Microbiology 140: 1817 - 1828 (1994)). With the aid of the polymerase chain reaction, a DNA fragment which carries the pck gene and surrounding regions is amplified. On the basis of the 10 sequence of the pck gene known for C. glutamicum (EP1094111 and Riedel et al., Journal of Molecular and Microbiological Biotechnology 3:573-583 (2001)) (Accession Number AJ269506), the following primer oligonucleotides are chosen for the PCR: 15 pck_beg (SEQ ID N0: 9): 5~ TA(A GAT~CT) G CCG GCA TGA CTT CAG TTT 3~ pck_end (SEQ ID N0: 10): 5~ AC(A GAT CT) G GTG GGA GCC TTT CTT GTT ATT3 The primers shown are synthesized by MWG Biotech and the 20 PCR reaction is carried out by the standard PCR method of Innis et al. (PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Academic Press).

Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid is called pKl8mobdsacBpckl 1.      A map of the plasmid is shown in Figure 3.     1.6 Incorporation of a second copy of the lysC gene in the form of the lysCF$R allele lysC T311I into the chromosome (target site: pck gene) of the strain DSM12866 by means of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBpckl_1 As described in Example 1.3, the plasmid pKl8mobsacBpckl_1. described in Example 1.5 is transferred into the C. glutamicum strain DSM12866 by conjugation. Selection is made for targeted recombination events in the chromosome of C. glutamicum DSM12866 as described in Example 1.3. Depending on the position of the second recombination event, after the excision the second copy of the lysCFBR allele manifests itself in the chromosome at the pck locus, or the original pck locus of the host remains.      Approximately 40 to 50 colonies are tested for the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin". Approximately 20 colonies which show the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin" are investigated with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. A DNA fragment which carries the pck gene and surrounding regions is amplified here from the chromosomal DNA of the colonies. The same primer oligonucleotides as are described in Example 1.5 for the construction of the integration plasmid are chosen for the PCR. pck beg (SEQ ID N0: 9): 5~ TA(A GAT CT) G CCG GCA TGA CTT CAG TTT 3~ pck_end (SEQ ID NO: 10): 5~ AC(A GAT CT) G GTG GGA GCC TTT CTT GTT ATT3 The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment approx. 2.9 kb in size in control clones with the original pck locus. In clones with a second copy of the lysCFBR allele in the chromosome at the pck locus, DNA fragments with a size of approx. 4.6 kb are amplified.      The amplified DNA fragments are identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8~ agarose gel.      A clone which, in addition to the copy of the wild-type gene present at the lysC locus, has a second copy of the lysC gene in the form of the lysCF$R allele lysC T311I at the pck locus in the chromosome was identified in this manner. This clone was called strain DSM12866pck::lysC. 1.7 Construction of the replacement vector pKlBmobsacBaecD1 1 The Corynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC13032 is used as the donor for the chromosomal DNA. From the strain ATCC13032, chromosomal DNA is isolated using the conventional methods (Eikmanns et al., Microbiology 140: 1817 - 1828 (1994)). With the aid of the polymerase chain reaction, a DNA fragment which carries the aecD gene and surrounding regions is amplified. On the basis of the sequence of the aecD gene known for C. glutamicum (Rossol et al., Journal of Bacteriology 174:2968-2977 (1992)) (Accession Number M89931), the following primer oligonucleotides are chosen for the PCR: aecD beg (SEQ ID NO: 11): 5~ GAA CTT ACG CCA AGC TGT TC 3~ aecD_end (SEQ ID NO: 12): 5~ AGC ACC ACA ATC AAC GTG AG 3~      The primers shown are synthesized by MWG Biotech and the PCR reaction is carried out by the standard PCR method of Innis et a1. (PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Academic Press). The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment of approx 2.1 kb in size, which carries the aecD gene and adjacent regions.     The amplified DNA fragment of approx. 2.1 kb in length is identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8~ agarose gel and isolated from the gel and purified by conventional methods (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen, Hilden). 5 The DNA fragment purified is cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI and EcoRV (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The ligation of the fragment in the vector pUCl8 then takes place (Norrander et al., Gene 26:101-106 (1983)). This is cleaved beforehand with the restriction 10 enzymes BglII and SmaI, dephosphorylated, mixed with the aecD-carrying fragment of approx. 1.5 kb, and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA Lipase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The ligation batch is transformed in the E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen, Leek, The 15 Netherlands). Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on kanamycin (50 mg/1)-containing LB agar with X-Gal (64 mg/1).      The plasmid obtained is checked by means of restriction cleavage, after isolation of the DNA, and identified in 20 agarose gel. The resulting plasmid is called pUCl8aecD.     Plasmid DNA was isolated from the strain DSM14242 (see Example 1.1) which carries the plasmid pCRIiTOPOlysC and cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and then treated with Klenow 25 polymerase. After separation in an agarose gel (0.8~) with the aid of the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the lysCF$R-containing DNA fragment approx. 1.7 kb in length is isolated from the agarose gel and employed for ligation with the vector pUCl8aecD described above. This is 30 cleaved beforehand with the restriction enzyme StuI, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline Phosphatase, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), mixed with the lysCFBR fragment of approx. 1.7 kb and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA Lipase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, 35 Germany).     The E. coli strain DH5amcr (Life Technologies GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanahan, In: DNA Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989).      Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2na Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which was supplemented with 50 mg/1 kanamycin.      Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid is called pUCl8aecDl.      The plasmid pUCl8aecD1 is cleaved with the restriction enzyme Kpnl and then treated with Klenow polymerase. The plasmid is then cleaved with the restriction enzyme Sall (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) and after separation in an agarose gel (0.8~) with the aid of the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the fragment of approx. 3.2 kb which carries aecD and lysC is isolated from the agarose gel and employed for ligation with the mobilizable cloning vector pKl8mobsacB described by Schafex et al. (Gene 14: &9-73 (1994)). This is cleaved beforehand with the restriction enzymes Smal and Sall and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline Phosphatase, Boehringer Mannheim), mixed with the fragment of approx. 3.2 kb which carries aecD and lysC, and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA Ligase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).      The E. coli strain DHSa (Grant et al.; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 87 (1990) 4645-4649) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanahan, In. DNA      Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989). Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A      Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which is supplemented with 50 mg/1 kanamycin.      Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid is called pKl8mobsacBaecD1_1.      A map of the plasmid is shown in Figure 2.      The plasmid pKl8mobsacBaecD1 1 was deposited in the form of a pure culture of the strain E. coli DHSamcr/pKl8mobsacBaecD1_1 (_ DHSalphamcr/pKl8mobsacBaecD1 1) on 5th June 2002 under number DSM15040 at the Deutsche Sammlung fur Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Treaty. 1.8 Incorporation of a second copy of the lysC gene as the lysCFBR allele into the chromosome (target site: aecD gene) of the strain DSM12866 by means of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBaecD1_1 As described in Example 1.3, the plasmid pKl8mobsacBaecD1 1 described in Example 1.4 is transferred into the C. glutamicum strain DSM12866 by conjugation. Selection is made for targeted recombination events in the chromosome of C, glutamicum DSM12866 as described in Example 1.3.      Depending on the position of the second recombination event, after the excision the second copy of the lysCFBR allele manifests itself in the chromosome at the aecD locus, or the original aecD locus of the host remains.      Approximately 40 to 50 colonies are tested for the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin". Approximately 20 colonies which show the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin"     are investigated with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. A DNA fragment which carries the aecD gene and surrounding regions is amplified here from the chromosomal DNA of the colonies. The same primer oligonucleotides as are described in Example 1.7 for the construction of the integration plasmid are chosen for the PCR. aecD beg (SEQ ID N0: 11): 5~ GAA CTT ACG CCA AGC TGT TC 3~ aecD_end (SEQ ID N0: 12): 5~ AGC ACC ACA ATC AAC GTG AG 3~      The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment approx. 2.1 kb in size in control clones with the original aecD locus. In clones with a second copy of the IySCFBR allele in the chromosome at the aecD locus, DNA fragments with a size of approx. 3..8 kb are amplified.      The amplified DNA fragments are identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8o agarose gel.      A clone which, in addition to the copy of the wild-type gene present at the lysC locus, has a second copy of the lysC gene in the form of the lysCFBR allele lysC T311I at the aecD locus in the chromosome was identified in this manner. This clone was called strain DSM12866aecD::lysC.      Example 2 Incorporation of a second copy of the ddh gene into the chromosome (target site: gluB gene) of the strain DSM12866 2.1 Construction of the replacement vector pKl8mobsacBglu2 1 The Corynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC13032 is used as the donor for the chromosomal DNA. From the strain ATCC13032, chromosomal DNA is isolated using the conventional methods (Eikmanns et al., Microbiology 140:     1817 - 1828 (1994)). With the aid of the polymerase chain reaction, a DNA fragment which carries the gluB gene and surrounding regions is amplified. On the basis of the sequence of the gluABCD gene cluster known for C. glutamicum (Kronemeyer et al., Journal of Bacteriology, 177: 1152 - 1158 (1995); EP1108790) (Accession Number X81191 and AX127149), the following primer oligonucleotides are chosen for the PCR: gluA_beg (SEQ ID NO: 13): 5~ CAC GGT TGC TCA TTG TAT CC 3~ gluD end (SEQ ID NO: 14): 5~ CGA GGC GAA TCA GAC TTC TT 3~      The primers shown are synthesized by MWG Biotech and the PCR reaction is carried out by the standard PCR method of 25 Innis et al. (PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Academic Press). The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment of approx 4.4 kb in size, which carries the gluB gene and surrounding regions.      The amplified DNA fragment is identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8~ agarose gel and isolated from the gel and purified by conventional methods (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen, Hilden).      Ligation of the fragment is then carried out by means of the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands, Cat. Number K4600-01) in the vector pCRII-TOPO. The ligation batch is transformed in the E. eoli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on kanamycin (50 mg/1)-containing LB agar with X-Gal (64 mg/1) .      The plasmid obtained is checked by means of restriction cleavage, after isolation of the DNA, and identified in agarose gel. The resulting plasmid is called pCRII-TOPOglu2.      The plasmid pCP.II-TOPOglu2 is cleaved with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and Sall (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, 5 Germany) and after separation in an agarose gel (0.80) with the aid of the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the gluB fragment of approx. 3.7 kb is isolated from the agarose gel and employed for ligation with the mobilizable cloning vector pKl8mobsacB described by Schafer 10 et al. (Gene 14, 69-73 (1994)). This is cleaved beforehand with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline Phosphatase, Boehringer Mannheim), mixed with the gluB fragment of approx. 3.7 kb, and the mixture is treated with 15 T4 DNA Ligase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).      The E. coli Strain DH5a, (Grant et al.; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 87 (1990) 4645-4649) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanahan, In. DNA      Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold 20 Spring Harbor, New York, 1989). Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A      Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which is supplemented with 50 mg/1 kanamycin. 25 Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid is called pKl8mobsacBglu2.      As described in Example 2.1, a DNA fragment which carries 30 the ddh gene and surrounding regions is also amplified with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. On the basis of the sequence of the ddh gene cluster known for C. glutamicum (Ishino et al., Nucleic Acids Research 15, 3917(1987)) (Accession Number Y00151), the following primer oligonucleotides are chosen for the PCR: ddh beg ( SEQ ID NO : 15 ) 5' CTG AAT CAA AGG CGG ACA TG 3' ddh_end (SEQ ID NO: 16): 5' TCG AGC TAA ATT AGA CGT CG 3' The primers shown are synthesized by MWG Biotech and the PCR reaction is carried out by the standard PCR method of Innis et al. (PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications, 1990, Academic Press). The primers allow amplification of a DNA fragment of approx 1.6 kb in size, which carries the ddh gene.      The amplified DNA fragment of approx. 1.6 kb in length, which the ddh gene, is identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8o agarose gel and isolated from the gel and purified by conventional methods (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiageri, Hilden).      After purification, the fragment carrying the ddh gene is employed for ligation in the vector pKl8mobsacBglu~ described. This is partly cleaved beforehand with the restriction enzyme BamHI. By treatment of the vector with a Klenow polymerise (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany), the overhangs of the cleaved ends are completed to blunt ends, the vector is then mixed with the DNA fragment of approx. 1.6 kb which carries the ddh gene and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA lipase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). By using Vent Polymerise (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) for the PCR reaction, a ddh-carrying DNA fragment which has blunt ends and is suitable for ligation in the pretreated vector pKl8mobsacBglu2 is generated.      The E. coli strain DH5amcr (Life Technologies GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanahan, In: DNA Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989).

Approximately 20 colonies which show the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin" are investigav~ed with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. A DPdA fragment which carries the glu region described is amplified here from the chromosomal DNA of the colonies.

This is cleaved beforehand with the restriction enzyme BssHII, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline Phosphatase, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), mixed with the DNA fragment of approx. 3.6 kb which carries the pyc gene, and the mixture is treated with T4 DNA Lipase (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany).      The E. coli strain DH5amcr (Life Technologies GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) is then transformed with the ligation batch (Hanaha~~; In: DNA Cloning. A Practical Approach. Vol. 1, ILR-Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989).      Selection of plasmid-carrying cells is made by plating out the transformation batch on LB agar (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989), which was supplemented with 50 mg/1 kanamycin.      Plasmid DNA is isolated from a transformant with the aid of the QIAprep Spin Niiniprep Kit from Qiagen and checked by restriction cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid -is called pKl8mobsacBpckl 2.     4.2 Construction of the pyc allele pyc P458S by means of site-specific mutagenesis of the wild-type pyc gene The site-direr_ted mutagenesis is carried out with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La 5 Jolla, USA). EP-A-1108790 describes a point mutation in the pyc gene for C. glutamicum which allows improved L-lysine production. On the basis of the point mutation in the nucleotide sequence of cytosine to thymine in the pyc gene at position i3i2, replacement in the amino acid sequence 10 derived therefrom of proline for serine at position 458 results. The allele is called pyc P458S. To generate the mutation described, the following primer oligonucleotides are chosen for the linear amplification:      P458S-1 (SEQ ID NO: 21): 15 5° GGATTCATTGCCGATCAC (TCG) CACCTCCTTCAGGCTCCA 3' P458S-2 (SEQ ZD NO: 22): 5'GTGGAGGAAGTCCGAGGT (CGA) GTGATCGGCAATGAATCC 3' The primers shown are synthesized by MWG Biotech. The codon for serine, which is to replace the proline at position 20 458, is marked by parentheses in the nucleotide sequence shown above. The plasmid pKl8mobsacBpckl 2 described in Example 4.1 is employed with the two primers, which are each complemeW~ary to a strand of the plasmid, for linear amplification by means of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. By this 25 lengthening of the primers, a mutated plasmid with broken circular strands is formed. The product of the linear amplification is treated with Dpnl - this endonuclease cleaves the methylated and half-methylated template DNA specifically. The newly synthesized broken, mutated vector 30 DNA is transformed in the E. coli strain XL1 Blue (Bullock, Fernandez and Short, BioTechniques (5) 376-379 (1987)).      After the transformation, the XL1 Blue cells repair the breaks in the mutated plasmids. Selection of the transformants was carried out on LB medium with kanamycin 50 mg/1. The plasmid obtained is checked by means of restriction cleavage, after isolation of the DNA, and identified in agarose gel. The DNA sequence of the mutated DNA fragment ~~~ checked by sequencing. The sequence of the PCR product coincides with the sequence described Ohnishi et al. (2002). The resulting plasmid is called pKl8mobsacBpckl_3. A map of the plasmid is shown in Figure 6. 4.3 Incorporation of a second copy of the pyc gene in the form of the pyc allele pycP458S into the chromosome (target site pck gene) of the strain DSM12866 by means of the replacement vector pkl8mobsacBpckl 3 The plasmid pK~8mobsacBpcki._3 described in Example 4.2 is transferred as described in Example 1.3 into the C. glutamicum strain DSM12866 by conjugation. Selection is made for targeted recombination events in the chromosome of C. glutamicum DSM12866 as described in Example 1.3.      Depending on the position of the second recombination event, of ter the excision the second copy of the pyc allele manifests itself in the chromosome at the pck locus, or the original pck locus of the host remains.      Approximately 40 to 50 colonies are tested for the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin". Approximately 20 colonies which show the phenotype "growth in the presence of sucrose" and "non-growth in the presence of kanamycin" are investigated with the aid of the polymerase chain reaction. A DNA fragment which carries the pck gene and surrounding regions is amplified here from the chromosomal DNA of the colonies. The same primer.oligonucleotides as are described ~.n Example 1.5 for the construction of the replacement plasmid are chosen for the PCR. pck_beg (SEQ ID N0: 9): 5~ TA(A GA~1 C'i) G CCG GCA TGA CTT CAG TTT 3~     pck end (SEQ ID NO: 10): 5~ AC(A GAT CT} G GTG GGA GCC TTT CTT GTT ATT3 The primers ,z1 _'_ow amplification of a DNA fragment approx. 2.9 kb in size in control clones with the original pck locus. In clones with a second copy of the pyc allele in the chromosome at the pck locus, DNA fragments with a size of approx. 6.5 kb are amplified.      The amplified DNA fragments are identified by means of electrophoresis in a 0.8o agarose gel.      A clone which, in addition to the copy of the wild-type gene present at the pyc locus, has a second copy of the pyc gene in the form of the pyc allele pycP458S at the pck locus in the chromosome was identified in this manner. This clone was called strain DSM12866pck::pyc.      Example 5 Preparation of Lysine The C. glutamicum strains DSM13994g1u::lysC, DSM12866g1u::lysC, DSM12866pck::lysC, DSM12866aecD::lysC, DSM12866g1u::ddh, DSM12866aecD::dapA and DSM12866pck::pyc obtained in Example 1, 2, 3 and 4 are cultured in a nutrient mediurz suitable for the production of lysine and the lysine content in the culture supernatant was determined.      For this, the cultures are first incubated on a brain-heart agar plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 24 hours at 33qC. Starting from this agar plate culture, a preculture is seeded (10 mi medium in a 100 ml conical flask). The medium MM is used as the medium for the preculture. The preculture is incubated for 24 hours at 33°-C at 240 rpm on a shaking machine. A main culture is seeded from this preculture such that the initial OD (660 nm) of the main culture is 0.1 OD. The Medium MM is also used for the main culture.

The sterile subs trate and vitamin solutions, as well as the CaC03 autoclaved in the dry state, are then added.      Culturing is carried out in a 10 ml volume in a 100 ml conical flask with baffles. Culturing is carried out at 33sC and 80o atmospheric humidity.     After 48 hours, the OD is determined at a measurement wavelength of 660 nm with a Biomek 1000 (Beckmann Instruments GmbH, Munich). The amount of lysine formed is determined winch an amino acid analyzer from Eppendorf-BioTronik (Hamburg, Germany) by ion exchange chromatography and post-column derivation with ninhydrin detection.      The result of the experiment is shown in Table 10.     ~a'hl r~ 1 fl Strain                   OD          Lysine HC1 (660 nm)    gll DSM13994                 12.0        19.1 DSM13994g1u::lysC        9.9        20.0 DSM12866                 12.5        14.9 DSM15039              11.4        16.2 DSM12866pck::lysC        12.6        16.5 DSM12866aecD::lysC       ~ 12.0      15.9 DSM12866g1u::ddh ~ 11.0      15.5 DSM12856aecD::dapA       ~ 11.1      16.2 DSM12866pck::pyc         = 10.9      16.9 i Brief Description of the Figures: 5 The base pair numbers stated are approximate values obtained in the context of reproducibility of measurements.
