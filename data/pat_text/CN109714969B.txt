 Background 
 The present application relates to biopesticides for use in the treatment, control and/or prevention of late blight of potatoes. More particularly, the present application relates to bacterial strains suitable for use in controlling pathogens causing late blight in potatoes. 
 Potato late blight, which is notoriously related to irish potato famine in the 1840's, is caused by infection of potato plants (potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.)) and other Solanum crops such as tomatoes and eggplants by pathogenic oomycetes (saprolegnia) Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de bay). The infection is characterized by a black/brown lesion on the plant stem and leaf, which rapidly expands and becomes necrotic. Harvested diseased potato tubers may rot upon storage or may spread disease to crops in the next year if they survive overwintering in storage facilities or in soil. 
 Current control measures involve integrated pest control methods, including population monitoring of pathogens; preventive measures such as rotation and disinfection (elimination or exclusion of infected plant parts from the farm); developing resistant crop varieties; and the use of chemical fungicides, which may require application up to 12-15 times per quarter, costing millions of dollars. However, phytophthora infestans is highly adaptable and various new genotypes have developed resistance to major fungicides including metalaxyl and mefenoxam or the ability to overcome crop resistance. Thus, potato late blight is a persistent problem and the most economically significant potato and tomato disease worldwide, producing crop losses and other control measure costs in excess of $ 67 billion per year, estimated worldwide. 
 Biopesticides are formulations containing naturally occurring microorganisms that kill, inhibit, or reduce the viability of target pests, and are a desirable alternative to chemical pesticides and other pest control mechanisms. Such biopesticides generally exhibit low human and mammalian toxicity, do not survive or reside in the environment outside of their natural host, and are generally considered safe. The microbial component of a biopesticide is typically a bacterium, fungus, or virus in a form that can spread and infect the target pest upon application. The microorganism can be host specific for a particular pest species, or have a broad spectrum of activity against a range of pest species. The large-scale production of such microorganisms using large-scale fermentation techniques contributes to the commercial viability of biopesticide production and use. 
 Thus, it would be desirable to have available microorganisms and biopesticidal formulations thereof that can be used to control late blight of potato.

 Examples of the invention 
 Other features of the present invention will become apparent from the following non-limiting examples, which illustrate, for example, the principles of the invention. 
 Example 1: microbial cultures 
 Bacterial suspension: 
 the bacterial culture maintained at-80 ℃ was thawed and cultured in Pseudomonas agar F medium (containing Difco) TM Tryptic digest of casein (10.0g), proteose peptone No. 3 (10.0g), K 2 HPO 4 (1.5g)、MgSO 4 (1.5g), agar (15.0g) and glycerol (10g) in water (1L)). The colonies were inoculated into 125mL of yeast extract glucose medium (YGM; containing yeast extract (2.0g), dextrose (2.5g), buffer solution (10mL, KH) 2 PO 4 (25.0g/L) and K 2 HPO 4 (25.0g/L)) and brine solution (10mL, MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O(10.0g/L)、MnSO 4 ·H 2 O (1.5g/L), NaCl (5.0g/L) and FeSO 4 ·7H 2 O (0.5g/L)) in water (1L total volume)) and incubated on a rotary shaker (150rpm) in a 500mL flask with baffles at 22 ℃ for 48 hours to give a bacterial suspension. 
 Cell-free bacterial filtrate: 
 the bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was vacuum filtered through a 0.22 μm non-protein binding filter to give a cell-free bacterial filtrate. 
 Phytophthora infestans cultures 
 Phytophthora infestans isolates genotypes CA-10(A1 mating type from tomato), US-08(A2 mating type from potato) and US-23(A1 mating type from potato) were used for in vitro testing. Phytophthora infestans isolates genotypes CA-09(A1 mating type from tomato), CA-10(A1 mating type from tomato), US-08(A2 mating type from potato) and US-22(A2 mating type from tomato) were used for in vivo testing. All P.infestans isolates were maintained on rye seed A agar (RSA) (Carden, C.E. and J.L. King (Jinks). "Spontaneous variability of individual P.infestans isolates.I. culture variation (Spontaneous variabilities of single isolates of Phytophthora infestans.I. Current variation)." Canada plant journal (Can.J. Bot.) (1968)46: 329-. 
 Example 2: in vitro biological analysis 
 Bacterial suspension 
 An agar plug (0.5cm diameter) of Phytophthora infestans (A1 or A2 mating types) was placed in the center of a petri dish (9cm diameter) containing rye seed A agar (RSA). An aliquot (2 μ Ι _ of) of the bacterial suspension was placed near the edge of the plate; 2-4 bacterial strains were tested on each plate. After incubation at 15 ℃ for 7 days, the inhibition zone was measured. Two experiments were performed, using four replicates each time. 
 Cell-free bacterial filtrate 
 The cell-free bacterial filtrate or sterile water as negative control was dispensed in agar (50%, v/v). Hyphal plugs of the pathogens were placed in the center of petri dishes (9cm diameter) and hyphal growth was measured after incubation at 22 ℃ for 7 and 12 days. Two experiments were performed, using four replicates each time. Using SAS TM The software analyzes the results. Percent (%) control was calculated as follows: 
 percent (%) control 100- (B/Cx 100) 
 Where B is the average growth observed on day 7 or  day  12 in the presence of bacterial filtrate and C is the average growth observed on day 7 or  day  12 in the presence of sterile water (control). 
 Results 
 Bacterial strains from the culture collection established by bosch, susan (department of agriculture and agri-food, canada) derived from various soils and plant roots harvested from canadian prairie and representing different taxonomic groups were tested as bacterial suspensions in the in vitro assays described above. 46 strains displayed activity in this assay and were selected for further testing. FIG. 1 shows the percentage control of cell-free filtrates of 20 of these selected bacterial strains against Phytophthora infestans genotypes CA-10(A1, tomato), US-08(A2, potato) and US-23(A1, potato) on  day  12. As can be seen from fig. 1, most of the tested bacterial strains showed significant inhibitory activity against one or more phytophthora infestans genotypes. 
 Example 3: in vivo feeding in vitro leaf bioassay 
 Potato leaves, each containing 5 leaflets, were selected and grown in 50mL tubes containing 10% Hoagland's solution (Hoagland, d.r. and inong (Arnon), d.i. "water-culture method for growing plants without soil" laboratory station announcement of university of california university institute of california, california (univ.calif.col.age.exp.sta.c.garkeley, CA) (1938),347 + 353 "). The leaves were immersed in the selected test or control treatment as described below and sprayed with a phytophthora infestans suspension after 2 hours until running off. The treated leaves were incubated at 22 ℃ under high humidity conditions (86% -92% relative humidity) and a 16 hour per day/8 hour per night light period. 
 Disease progression and severity on leaves was measured by estimating the proportion of photosynthetic regions affected by the pathogen after 7 and 10 days of incubation (James, 1971: James, w.c. Plant Disease Assessment key, its Preparation and use of graphic books (An illuminated Series of Assessment Keys for Plant Diseases, the pair preference and Usage). Canadian Plant Disease Survey (Canadian Plant Disease Survey) (1971)51(2), 39-65). Disease coverage area was scored individually for each of the five leaflets (maximum 20) and the scores for the individual leaflets were summed to give a total score for each leaf (maximum 100). The percent disease severity was determined by dividing the disease severity rating of the treated leaf by the disease severity rating of the leaf when exposed to the individual pathogen and multiplying the result by 100%. 
 Results 
 In the in vivo fed leaf bioassay described above, 46 selected bacterial strains were tested using 12 leaves per treatment. The experiment was repeated twice. Each group of 12 leaves was treated by immersion in the bacterial suspension as prepared in example 1, the cell-free bacterial filtrate as prepared in example 1, the autoclaved (20 min, 121psi) bacterial suspension or YGM medium alone (control) prior to exposure to P.infestans (10,000 sporangia/ml; US-08 isolate). 
 Figure 2 shows the percentage of disease severity of infected leaves treated with bacterial suspensions and cell-free bacterial filtrates from 46 test bacterial strains at 10 days after treatment and inoculation with p. Bacterial strains were arranged in order of increasing disease severity from left to right for leaves exposed to full culture (bacterial suspension). Thus, the most effective bacterial strain of the whole culture against phytophthora infestans was identified on the left side of the graph. 
 Six bacterial strains were selected for further study based on the role of the whole bacterial culture in controlling the severity of the disease caused by phytophthora infestans. In the in vivo fed leaf bioassay described above, six bacterial strains were tested using 18 leaves per treatment. The experiment was repeated four times. Each set of 18 leaves was treated by immersion in 48 hour bacterial suspension or distilled water as prepared in example 1 before exposure to phytophthora infestans (7,000 sporangia/ml). Each of the Phytophthora infestans genotypes CA-09(A1), CA-10(A1), US-08(A2) and US-22(A2) was tested in separate experiments. The percentage of disease severity of leaves exposed to Phytophthora infestans (US-08(A2) isolate) in the presence of six selected bacterial strains is shown in Table 1. 
 Table 1: 
 
 
 
 as can be seen from the data in Table 1, all six bacterial strains protected potato leaves from infection with the Phytophthora infestans genotype US-08(A2) when applied as a bacterial suspension. In addition, cell-free isolates of strains UWO1, KENGFT3, 189 and WAUSV3 were shown to significantly protect potato leaves from infection with Phytophthora infestans genotype US-08 (A2). 
 As can be seen from fig. 3,  strain  189 and WAUSV36 showed the best percent control of growth for phytophthora infestans genotype CA-09(a 1). Also, FIGS. 4 and 5 show that strain 189 better protects potato leaves from infection with Phytophthora infestans genotype US-22(A2) than the five other strains tested. Table 2 shows a comparison of the efficacy of the bacterial suspension treatment with each of the six tested bacterial strains against the four phytophthora infestans genotypes compared to the treatment with distilled water (control). SS indicates that at the p-0.01 level, the results from treatment with bacteria were statistically significantly better than those from treatment with bacteria; NSS indicates that at the p-0.01 level, the difference between treatment with bacteria and controls is not statistically significant.

 example 4: bacterial identification 
 The bacterial suspension (200 μ L, as prepared in example 1) was boiled for 5 minutes, then cooled to room temperature and centrifuged. The supernatant (2. mu.L) was subjected to PCR (polymerase chain reaction) conditions to amplify the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and  chaperonin  60 universal target (cpn60UT) regions of the bacterial genome. The ITS regions were amplified and the bands were sized to group similar strains together so as to avoid repeated sequencing of highly similar or identical cpn60UT sequences from closely related strains. 
 Selection, phenotyping and Identification of acidogenic and hydrogenerogenic bacteria from vaginal samples of Canada and East African women by, for example, Serenberg (Schellenberg), et al, "Selection, phenotyping and Identification of acidogenic and hydrogenerogenic bacteria from biological samples of Canadian and East African women) Primers ITS-F and ITS-R described in "public science library integration (PLoS One) (2012)7(7) e41217 generate ITS amplicons. Band size was determined by polyacrylamide gel (4% -20% gradient gel, Invitrogen) electrophoresis, and SYBR was used TM Green I stain (invitrogen) was post-stained. The gel was imaged with a berle corporation (Bio-Rad) gel imager and the band size was determined by comparison to molecular weight markers. 
 The sequence of cpn60UT of bacterial isolates was determined by direct sequencing of amplicons generated using the M13 adapted universal primer H729/H730 as described in ancient (Goh) et al, "Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and roamococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60gene sequences" -Journal of Clinical Microbiology (Journal of Clinical Microbiology) (2000)38: 3953). Using M13 adapted cpn60UT "magic" primer H1594: (5'-CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGACGTCGCCGGTGACGGCACCACCAC-3' (SEQ ID NO:1) and H1595: 5'-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGACGACGGTCGCCGAAGCCCGGGGCCTT-3' (SEQ ID NO:2) (primers well-provided by doctor of Schoen Hemmingsen (Sean Hemmingsen) of National institute of Research, Canada) successfully amplified samples with higher G/C content (e.g., Pseudomonas) 2 500nM each dNTP and 400nM of each forward and reverse primer set, 95 ℃ for 3 minutes for one cycle and 95 ℃ for 30 seconds for 40 cycles, 50 ℃ for 30 seconds and 72 ℃ for 30 seconds. 
 In some cases, as in Hill et al, the improvement of template representation in a library of cpn60Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) products generated from composite templates by using a particular PCR primer mix (PCR) is indicated by the use of a specific PCR primer mix (PCR) product library"Environmental Microbiology (Environmental Microbiology) (2005)8:741-746 amplicons were generated with primers H1612-H1613 and H279-H280 in a molar ratio of 3:1 and cloned into pGEM prior to sequencing TM -T simple vector (Promega). Using QiaQuick TM PCR purification kit (Qiagen) or by using Amicon TM YM-30 ultrafiltration membrane (Fisher) was used to purify the amplicon and sequence it. Using QuickLyse before sequencing TM Plasmid was prepared using a plasmid kit (Qiagen). 
 Results 
 Some bacterial strains found to be effective in controlling phytophthora infestans infections are identified by: the sequence of the  chaperonin  60 universal target (cpn60UT) region of the bacterial genome was compared to the corresponding sequence from a known bacterial strain. Initial identification was performed by comparison to a reference database supplemented by construction of phylogenetic trees, including, but not limited to, the chaperonin database (Hill J.E. et al, "cpnDB: chaperonin sequence database (cpnDB: a chaperonin sequence database)" Genome research (Genome Res.) (2004)14: 1669-. Based on this comparison, six bacterial strains selected for further study were identified as follows: 
 
 
 
 example 5: sequencing of bacterial genomes 
   Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain  189 
 Genomic DNA was purified from 1mL of an overnight culture of pseudomonas chlororaphis  strain  189 in YGM (example 1) using Wizard genomic DNA (gdna) extraction kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced on a MiSeq platform using a mate pair protocol (kindling (Illumina)) to generate 2.8Mb mate pair reads. Another 8-kb insert paired-end sequencing operation was performed based on the paired-end fast library preparation Protocol for Titanium chemistry (Roche, 3 p 2012) with the modifications as described (Hill et al, Protocol Exchange (2014) doi: 10.1038/protein.2014.028), generating 166,514 paired-end reads with a pairing distance estimated to be 5,641. + -. 1,410 bp. 
 The editors reads were assembled with a k-mer size 127 and a positioning length 34 using a soapdenov version 22.01 (Luo et al: soapdenov 2: an empirically improved memory efficient short segment read de novo assembler (soapdenov 2: an empirical improved memory-effective short-read de novo assembler. big data science (Gigascience) (2012)1: 18). The resulting 957 contigs (N) were split using an EMBOSS splitter 50 33,267bp) into 500bp fragments with 200bp overlap, combined with Roche paired-end reads, and reassembled using Newbler version 3.0 (454Life Sciences). Gaps in the sequence were filled using the gapcore tool for soaldenovo 2 and PCR and Sanger (Sanger) sequencing. All sequencing data assembled together to produce a final 6.8Mbp genomic sequence with 152X coverage (SEQ ID NO:3) with a single architecture without gaps and without any plasmid evidence. Sequence data was annotated using the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation channel (Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline) version 3.1 (NCBI). 
 The genome of  P.chlororaphis strain  189 contains 6,837,781bp (62.74% G/C); 6,025 genes and 5,934 genes encoding proteins were observed, as well as 6 genes encoding 5S rRNA, 5 genes encoding 16S rRNA, 5 genes encoding 23S rRNA, and 71 genes encoding tRNA. In addition, 2,075 orthologous group clusters were identified by using integrated microbial genome port tagging. 
 Examination of the sequence of P.chlororaphis strain 189cpn60 showed that this strain is most closely related to P.chlororaphis subsp.aureus (NZ _ CM001559.1) and has a nucleotide identity of 99.6%. Consistent with this observation, the determination of the mean nucleotide identity at the genome level using 14 other genomes from this species revealed that P.chlororaphis  strain  189 shares the highest genomic sequence identity with this strain (98.36%). Genome similarity measures of several other strains of pseudomonas chlororaphis that exhibit a biocontrol phenotype (including PA23) place them in the same species as pseudomonas chlororaphis  strain  189. As with PA23, pseudomonas chlororaphis  strain  189 contains an array of biosynthetic pathways capable of producing metabolites involved in biological control, including hydrogen cyanide, phenazine, pyocin (pyocin), pyrroloquinoline quinone, and cell wall degrading enzymes. Genes conferring the ability to produce surfactants and form biofilms have also been discovered. The genome-wide sequence data has been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession number CP014867 (Down et al, genome Notification (2016, 5/6 months) 4(3): e 00581-16). 
 Pseudomonas fluorescens strain KENGFT3 
 Genomic DNA was purified from 1mL of an overnight culture of pseudomonas fluorescens strain KENGFT3 in YGM (example 1) using Wizard genomic DNA (gdna) extraction kit (puromage, madison, wisconsin., usa) and sequenced on GS Junior using Titanium Plus chemistry (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). Newbler version 3.0 (454life science) was used to assemble reads from two shotgun sequencing operations with average read lengths of 548 and 534 bp. The total number of reads that passed through the filter was 128,460, and the total number of assembled bases was 69,421,957.

 The genome of P.fluorescens strain KENGFT3 contained 6,183,292bp (59.95% G + C content). A total of 5,791 genes and 5,549 genes encoding proteins were observed, as well as 6 genes encoding 5S rRNA, 5 genes encoding 16S rRNA, 5 genes encoding 23S rRNA, and 64 genes encoding tRNA. Most (77.76%) of the genes encoding the proteins had the predicted function and 2,053 COG clusters were identified. 
 SpecI (Mendi (Mende) et al, Nature Methods (2013),10:881- & 884) was unable to assign Pseudomonas strain KENGFT3 as a species cluster (95.1% nucleotide identity with Pseudomonas fluorescens strain  SBW  25; GenBank accession NC-012660.1). JSpecies (Richter et al, proces national academy of sciences USA (2009)106:19126-19131) also discloses that the comparative genomic measure of pseudomonas strain KENGFT3 makes it lower than the discrimination cut-off for inclusion in the same species as pseudomonas fluorescens  SBW  25. However, a comparative genomic measure of P.fluorescens strain LBUM223 sharing certain phenotypic attributes with strain KENGFT3 resulted in both strains being within the same species (average nucleotide identity (ANI), 99.39%). Distance tree discovery occurred using a computational system of 60 P.fluorescens strains tagged in integrated microbial genome ports, P.fluorescens strains KENGFT3 and LBUM223 clustered with P.fluorescens strains GcM5-1A and UK 4. The pseudomonas fluorescens strain KENGFT3 has an array of genes that have been correlated with biocontrol phenotypes including, among others, phenazine formate synthesis, chitinase and cellulase enzymes, and pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis. Ten genes encoding putative beta-lactamases were also found. The genome-wide sequence data has been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession number CP014868 (Down et al, genome Notification (5/6/2016) 4(3): e 00428-16). 
 Pantoea strain OXWO6B1 
 Genomic DNA was purified from 1mL of an overnight culture of Pantoea strain OXWO6B1 in YGM (example 1) using Wizard genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Genomic shotgun sequencing was performed on a MiSeq platform (kindling) yielding 2.9M paired-end reads. These data were supplemented by an 8-kb insert paired-end sequencing operation performed using a paired-end fast library preparation protocol for Titanium chemistry (roche, 3/2012) with modifications as previously described (hil et al, protocol exchange (2014) doi: 10.1038/protein.2014.028). This procedure produced 187,389 paired-end reads with a pairing distance estimated 6,310 ± 1,577 bp. 
 The enlightening company reads were assembled with a k-mer size 127 and a localization length 34 using SOAPdenovo2 (version 2.01). The resulting 690 contigs (N) were split using an EMBOSS splitter 50 44,093bp) into 500bp fragments with 200bp overlap, and Roche intoEnd reads are combined and reassembled using Newbler (version 3.0). Gaps in the sequence were filled using the gapcore tool for soaldenovo 2, as well as PCR and sanger sequencing. All sequencing data assembled together to generate a high quality genome sequence draft with 201X coverage with 2 frameworks of 4,677,766bp (2 framework contigs; the first containing residues 1 to 200112(SEQ ID NO:13) and the second containing residues 200566 to 4677766(SEQ ID NO:14)) and 118,792bp (single contig; SEQ ID NO:15), respectively. Three plasmids, 253,747bp (SEQ ID NO:16), 181,185bp (SEQ ID NO:17) and 4650bp (SEQ ID NO:18), were confirmed using PCR. Sequence data was annotated using the prokaryotic genome annotation channel version 3.1 (NCBI) and integrated microbial genome port. 
 The genome of Pantoea strain OXWO6B1 was 5,236,140bp (52.74% G + C content). A total of 5,030 genes and 4,868 genes encoding proteins were identified, as well as 10 genes encoding 5S rRNA, 7 genes encoding 16S rRNA, 7 genes encoding 23S rRNA, and 78 genes encoding tRNA. 
 The sequences of the taxonomic markers 16S rRNA and rpoB indicate that strain OXWO6B1 is most closely related to Pantoea ananatis (Pantoea ananatis), which has 99% (16S) and > 97% (rpoB) identity with Pantoea ananatis. However, the bacterial barcode marker cpn60 has low sequence identity to any Pantoea, with the nearest neighbor being Pantoea stewartii (Pantoea stewartii) with 93.7% sequence identity. In line with this, the genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) of strain OXWO6B1 was below the specified cut-off value for species identity with any of the reported pantoea species, with a maximum of 88.9% ANI with pantoea ananatis. Furthermore, comparison of 40 Orthologous Cluster Groups (Cluster of organisours Groups; COG) using SpecI (Mendi et al, Nature methods (2013),10:881- & 884) revealed that Pantoea strain OXWO6B1 could not be assigned as a Cluster of species (95.0% nucleotide identity to Pantoea ananatis). Pantoea strain OXWO6B1 contains genes that have been correlated with a biocontrol phenotype including phenazine formate synthesis and cell wall degrading enzymes. Two genes encoding putative beta-lactamases were also observed. This genome-wide shotgun project has been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accession numbers LWLR00000000 and LWLR01000000 (Down's et al, genome Notification (2016 5/6 months) 4(3): e 00582-16). 
 Arthrobacter strain OY3WO11 
 Genomic DNA was purified from 1mL of an overnight culture of arthrobacter strain OY3WO11 in YGM (example 1) using Wizard genomic DNA (gdna) extraction kit (puromage, madison, wisconsin., usa) and sequenced on GS Junior using Titanium Plus chemistry (roche diagnostics, quecharville, ca). A total of 142,372 shotgun reads of average length 644bp were generated. In addition, the 8-kb insert paired-end sequencing operation was performed based on the paired-end fast library preparation protocol for Titanium chemistry (Roche, 3/2012) with modifications as previously described (Hill et al, protocol exchange (2014) doi: 10.1038/protein.2014.028). A total of 170,435 paired-end reads were generated with an estimated pairing distance of 6,383. + -. 1,595 bp. All sequencing operations were assembled to produce an improved high quality sequence draft with 35X genome coverage. Newbler version 3.0 (454Life sciences) was used to assemble the data, resulting in 3 architectures of 4,253,622bp (containing 19 contigs; SEQ ID NO:19 through SEQ ID NO:37, Table 4), 258,581bp (1 contig; SEQ ID NO:38) and 4,841bp (1 contig SEQ ID NO:39), respectively. Sequence data was annotated using the prokaryotic genome annotation channel version 3.1 (NCBI).

 the Arthrobacter strain OY3WO11 has a total genome size of 4,517,044bp and a G + C content of 65.29%. The genome annotation revealed 4,225 genes and 4,163 genes encoding proteins. The genome has 1 gene encoding 5S rRNA, 2 genes encoding 16S rRNA, 1 gene encoding 23S rRNA, and 50 genes encoding tRNA. 
 The genome of the arthrobacter strain OY3WO11 contains genes that have been associated with biocontrol phenotypes including phenazine formate synthesis and cell wall degrading enzymes. Two genes encoding putative beta-lactamases were observed. The sequence comprising the gene encoding 16S rRNA and the taxonomic marker of rpoB shares 97% to 99% identity with the corresponding gene, spe 3, found in Arthrobacter phenanthrenii (arthromobacter phenantrenivorans). Similarly, two copies of the bacterial barcode marker cpn60 were identified, each of which clustered with the corresponding copy from arthrobacter phenanthreneophilus Sphe3 and had 93% to 96% sequence identity, by phylogenetic analysis. Comparison of the genomic sequence of the arthrobacter strain OY3WO11 with the 85 genomic sequences from arthrobacter annotated in the integrated microbial genome port revealed that the mean nucleotide identity (ANI) of the genome of strain OY3WO11 was below the specified cut-off value for inclusion in any of the species included in the assay (the closest ANI was arthrobacter phenanthrophilus Sphe3, 85.25%). In addition, SpecI (Dondi et al, Nature. methods (2013),10: 881-; the closest match within the 40 orthologous Cohorts (COG) was arthrobacter phenanthrophilus phe3 with an average ANI of 93.9%. Taken together, these observations indicate that strain OY3WO11 can represent a previously uncharacterized or unsequenced arthrobacter strain. This genome-wide shotgun project has been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accession numbers LWLP00000000 and LWLP01000000 (Down's et al, genome Notification (2016 5/6 months) 4(3): e 00585-16).

 The genome size of the bacillus subtilis strain WAUSV36 was 4,238,871bp and consisted of 43.32% G + C content. A total of 4,510 genes and 4,404 genes encoding proteins were observed, as well as 2 genes encoding 5S rRNA, 3 genes encoding 16S rRNA, 5 genes encoding 23S rRNA, and 60 genes encoding tRNA. A total of 1,688 orthologous group Clusters (COG) clusters were identified by using Integrated Microbial Genome (IMG) port labeling. 
 For example, the gene encoding 16S rRNA and the sequence of the taxonomic marker rpoB are > 99% identical to the corresponding sequences of many strains of Bacillus subtilis. Similarly, the sequence of the single copy bacterial barcode marker cpn60 is identical to several strains of Bacillus subtilis. At the genome-wide level, the paired average nucleotide identity of strain WAUSV36 with the 25 bacillus subtilis strains available at the IMG port was 99.96%, and was below the specified nucleotide identity cut-off for other species of bacillus. Finally, SpecI (Dondi et al, Nature. methods (2013),10: 881-. These observations indicate that strain WAUSV36 is a bacillus subtilis strain. 
 Similar to other bacillus subtilis strains associated with a biocontrol phenotype, the genome of strain WAUSV36 had genes involved in biofilm formation, but no genes associated with surfactant production were observed. Five genes encoding putative beta-lactamases and three cellulase genes were also found. This genome-wide shotgun project has been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accession numbers LWLQ00000000 and LWLQ01000000 (Down et al, genome Notification (2016 5/6 months) 4(3): e 00586-16). 
 Example 6: determination of antifungal Activity by measuring fungal growth Using Indirect impedance analysis 
 Methods for assessing the antifungal activity of bacterial isolates against phytophthora infestans and by which (He), j, et al "Concurrent selection for microbial inhibition of Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium ear blight and Fusarium oxysporum in wheat (joint of Applied Microbiology) (2009),106(6),1805-1817 are described similarly. Growth of Phytophthora infestans in liquid medium in the presence or absence of cell-free culture filtrate of the bacterial isolate to be tested was by means of a microbial impedance Analyzer (BacTrac) TM 4300, Sy-Lab Instruments GmbH, Austria). Microbial growth is measured based on the decrease in the impedance of the medium caused by the production of small charged compounds as microbial growth continues. 
 Cell-free bacterial culture filtrate: 
 bacterial isolates (OY3WO11, 189, WAUSV36, KENGFT3, OXWO6B1 and UWO1) stored at-80 ℃ were suspended in potato dextrose broth (PDB (Difco) TM ) BD Company (Becton, Dickinson and Company) or minimal medium (MM, shore (Shao), s., week (Zhou), t., and mecavil (McGarvey), b.d. "Comparative metabolic analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during degradation of patulin using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Comparative metabolic-mass spectrometry) using microbial analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (Applied Microbiology and technology), (2012)94(3), page 789 + 797) and adjusted to an Optical Density (OD) reading of 1.0(620 μm). For 50mLFalcon TM The medium (PDB or MM; 24mL) in the test tube was inoculated with 1mL of the bacterial suspension. The inoculated tubes were incubated at room temperature (23. + -. 2 ℃) for 6 days on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. The resulting bacterial culture was centrifuged at 2,650g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter (mixed cellulose ester; MCE) into a new test tube to give a cell-free bacterial culture filtrate. 
 Analysis conditions were as follows: 
 for each experiment, five samples (discs 9mm in diameter) cut from a Phytophthora infestans culture grown on rye B agar for 2-3 weeks (caran, c.e. and j.l. gold, "Spontaneous variability of Phytophthora infestans single isolate,. i. culture variation (spinal properties of single isolates of Phytophthora infestans. i. current variation.)" journal of canadian botanicals (1968)46: 329-. Sterile medium was used as a control. Fungal growth (measured by changes in impedance) was monitored at 22 ℃ for 120 hours at 20 minute intervals. Each experiment was repeated three times. 
 And (3) data analysis: 
 using BacEval TM Computer program (Sy-lab instruments Inc. (2002): BacTrac TM The 4000 series manual for microbial operations v1.05e) to analyze the impedance curve. The data of the impedance measurements were inverse transformed and used as an indicator of fungal growth. Using SAS/STAT TM 9.2(SAS), General Linear Model (GLM) program to statistically analyze data. Using contrasts (sas) to compare fungal growth curves; the average fungal growth at each time point was compared using the dukel test. 
 Results 
 Statistical analysis of all 6 bacterial isolates indicated that the growth curves of phytophthora infestans were significantly different in the two media used, MM and PDB (P <0.001) and were analyzed separately. 
 As seen in fig. 6, the growth of phytophthora infestans was fastest in MM in the absence of cell-free bacterial culture filtrate (positive control). Among the 6 bacteria tested, cell-free filtrates from 4 bacterial strains (189, WAUSV36, OXWO6B1 and UWO1) showed significant inhibition of fungal growth (P < 0.01). However, the growth of P.infestans treated with the cell-free filtrates from the bacterial isolates OY3WO11 and KENGFT3 was not statistically significantly different from the growth of the control (P > 0.05). 
 As seen in fig. 7, four cell-free bacterial culture filtrates (from  strain  189, WAUSV36, OXWO6B1 and KENGFT3) inhibited the growth of phytophthora infestans in PDB. Cell-free filtrates from isolate OXWO6B1 showed statistically significant growth inhibition (p 0.05), and cell-free filtrates from isolates WAUSV36, 189 and KENGFT3 showed even stronger growth inhibition (p 0.01). The cell-free filtrate from isolate OY3WO11 did not show a significant effect on pathogen growth, and the cell-free filtrate from isolate UWO1 significantly stimulated phytophthora infestans growth (p ═ 0.01). 
 Figure 8 shows the percent inhibition of growth of phytophthora infestans after 120 hours incubation in the presence of cell-free bacterial culture filtrate compared to growth in the presence of sterile medium (positive control). The mean values indicated with the same letters (a/a, B/B or C/C for PDB and MM media, respectively) did not differ significantly at the p 0.05 level according to the ducrey test (j. "comparison of Individual Means in Analysis of Variance" biometry (1949)5(2): 99-114). In MM, cell-free filtrates from isolates WAUSV36, OXWO6B1 and 189 significantly reduced fungal growth and inhibited phytophthora infestans growth by 72.8%, 50.4% and 49.0%, respectively, compared to controls. Cell-free filtrate from isolate UWO1 showed significantly weaker activity in MM, reducing phytophthora infestans growth by 21.7%. In PDB, cell-free filtrates from isolates WAUSV36 and 189 inhibited the growth of phytophthora infestans by 77.8% and 64.7%, respectively, compared to the control, significantly more than the cell-free filtrate from isolate KENGFT3, which reduced fungal growth by 29.2% in PDB.
