The high-quality yeast of local characteristic crusty pancake dough and its technical field of application. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 " crusty pancake " one etymology was once popular in the Arabia Peninsula, Turkey, the Central Asia, all states in West Asia in Persian.But baked naan is simultaneously
It is non-to be derived from these areas.According to textual criticism, the history of Uygur's baked naan is said away from the present in existing more than 2000 years, Uygur nationality's common saying：" can
With one day without dish, but never can be with one without crusty pancake." visible, not only baked naan is the most important pastries of the Uygur nationality, and eats crusty pancake
As a kind of custom, the culture of Uygur. 
 Recently as China's expanding economy, the continuous improvement of living standards of the people and the quickening of rhythm of life, cities and towns
Resident sharply increases to the demand for commodity of craming food into one's mouth, while it is also proposed higher requirement, the industrialized production of crusty pancake to the quality of crusty pancake
The demand of modern society is turned into.Crusty pancake be using wheat flour, maize flour or jowar face as raw material, add a little salt solution and ferment face be baked and
Into a kind of flour cake, be one of traditional staple food of the Uygur nationality in the manufacturing process of crusty pancake, crusty pancake dough fermentation be one critically important

The quality of ferment characteristic and crusty pancake, it is current to make the dough fermentation ferment common mostly using spontaneous fermentation or directly using outsourcing of being cramed food into one's mouth in crusty pancake
Mother, and known system crusty pancake technique or like the people of crusty pancake all to understand that yeast all has the function that for the taste and flavor of crusty pancake important. 
 All very love eats the crusty pancake with traditional crusty pancake dough fermentation to many people from Xinjiang.Crusty pancake dough be also known as old ferment, emptins, old fertilizer,
Face kind, face head, fermentation are the traditional dough fermentation methods in China, still extensively should so far in the vast urban and rural households in Xinjiang
With.Not only cost is cheap for this method, simple and easy to do, crusty pancake is kept genuine, but the largely presence of miscellaneous bacterias in dough of craming food into one's mouth,
Not only there is the risk for propagating pathogeny, also result in dough fermentation peracid, it is necessary to which adding soda carries out neutralization tart flavour.To base excess,
Flour product meta-alkali is turned to be yellow, and naan surface is easy to crack, and flavor is also bad.The business of the manufacturer productions such as various Angel Yeasts common at present
