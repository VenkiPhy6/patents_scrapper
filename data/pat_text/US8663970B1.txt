 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a novel recombinant yeast substrain, especially to a recombinant yeast substrain suitable for the production of ethanol by fermentation under 42° C. with high efficiency. The recombinant yeast substrain was constructed by replacing the genomic regulatory region for yeast gene hsp104 using linear DNA transformation, so as to alter the behavior of Hsp104 protein under stress and to facilitate the production of alcohol by high-temperature fermentation. 
 2. Description of the Prior Art 
 Biomass ethanol is a biomass fuel that generates bio-energy and is obtained by conversion of biomass. Said biomass may be molasses or plants such as maize, wheat or potatoes that allow production of biomass ethanol through the processes of fermentation and distillation. Biomass ethanol is known as a feasible way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. 
 Materials for making biomass ethanol are roughly classified into three categories: 
 1) sugar materials derived from monosaccharide-abundant sugar corps such as sugar cane or sorgo; 
 2) starch materials derived from wheat or corn; and 
 3) cellulosic materials derived from agricultural wastes. 
 Materials of the first and second categories primarily come from food corps. Using such material leads to the zero-sum competition between food and energy applications that are both based on food corps. Materials of the third category, though raise no competition between food and energy applications, require a high production cost yet to be overcome. 
 The method for making ethanol from the cellulosic materials of the third category may be largely divided into four stages: 
 1) pretreatment with weak acid, weak base or ammonia-gas explosions to separate cellulose or hemicellulose from the complex comprising binding lignin, so as to facilitate the chemical or biological processing in following stages. 
 2) degeneration or hydrolysis for obtaining free sugars; 
 3) fermentation of mixed hexose and pentose to produce ethanol; and 
 4) collection and distillation of the product for obtaining biomass ethanol. 
 One of the means for lowering the production cost is to synchronize the degeneration/hydrolysis stage and the fermentation stage. 
 However, the operation temperature for the cellulose enzyme employed in the degeneration/hydrolysis stage is approximately 45-60° C., which is higher than the fermentation temperatures of most industrial brewing yeasts ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ). Should a yeast with high-temperature tolerance capable of working under the high temperature of the degeneration/hydrolysis stage be cultivated, such a thermotolerant yeast would synchronously proceed the tasks of the degeneration/hydrolysis stage and the fermentation stage, so as to lower the production cost of biomass ethanol. 
 Only a few of antecedent technologies are relevant to thermotolerant yeast as below listed works: 
 Yamada et al. (US patent application publication number: US 2010/0062506), with screening media containing high concentration of sugar and alcohol thermotolerant, have isolated yeast  Kluyveromyces marxianus  capable of producing ethanol by fermentation of sugar cane juice and peaking best productivity as high as 1.51 g of ethanol per liter per hour at 40° C. 
 Forrester et al. (US patent application publication number: US 2011/0033907) have isolated  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strains YE1358 and YE1615. At 37° C., fermentation of 250 g/L maize flour and 2 mM CaCl 2  with YE1615 gives approximately 130 g/L ethanol. 
 Abbas et al. (US patent application publication number: US 2009/0155872) have constructed a plasmid comprising 1)  H. polymorpha  ( P. angusta ) glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) promoter-heat shock protein 104 (hsp104) gene and 2) GADPH promoter-xylulokinase. Transforming  H. polymorpha  with the plasmid suppresses the activity of acid trehalase (ATH1) and raises the capability of  H. polymorpha  to ferment 12% xylose for producing ethanol. 
 Edgardo et al. (Edgardo et al. 2008 , Enzym. Microb. Tech.  43, 120-123) have screened  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  at 35-45° C. to isolate strains capable of growing and fermenting glucose at 42° C. However, the fermentation efficiency of the strain is 75% lower than the theoretical value in a solution of 50 g/L glucose concentration at 40° C., and is 25% lower at 52° C. 
 Benjaphokee et al. (Benjaphokee et al. 2012 , N. Biotechnol.  29, 379-386), by crossing the spores of thermotolerat  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  HB8-3A and ethanol-productive  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  TISTR5606, have obtained a strain, TJ14, capable of fermenting glucose at 41° C. in a pH 3.5 solution of glucose concentration 100 g/L with a peak fermentation efficiency as high as 90%. 
 Lindquist and Kim have identified that a molecular chaperone in yeast, the molecular chaperone Hsp104, is capable of separating gathered proteins and refold the same, which raises the thermotolerance of the yeast (Bösl, et al. 2006 , J. Struct. Biol.  156, 139-148). Hsp104 and Hsp70/40 extract polypeptide chains out from an aggregated protein complex and facilitate the refolding of the same (Lee et al. 2003 , Cell  115, 229-240; Waghmare et al. 2003 , Biotechniques  34, 1024-1028; Storici et al. 1999 , Yeast  15, 271-283; Weibezahn et al. 2005 , Biol. Chem.  386, 739-744). Heat shock protein and other molecular chaperones are indispensable for cellular stasis of a cell. In normal circumstances, it is vital that these chaperones are sufficiently expressed. When under environmental stress, misfolded proteins accumulate and disrupt cellular physiological conditions. Misfolded proteins may further induce generation of chaperones, which help restore and maintain normal cellular physiological conditions. Comparing with other chaperones, Hsp104 is insignificant under normal conditions and thus its low concentration. However, under fatal environmental stress, the concentration of Hsp104 acutely rises in a short period of time to restore the activities of the disabled proteins accumulated in the cell. In  Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Hsp104, though expression level of which raises responsive to a stress, the expression level lowers in a few hours, which fails to allow  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to survive at high temperature for a significantly long period of time and thus makes  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  unsuitable for synchronized hydrolysis and fermentation. 
 Altered expression of recombinant genes to enhance tolerance of yeasts to stress is practicable. However, few available recombination tags tend to be insufficient. In order to reuse the recombination tags that are few in number, the FLP/FRT recognition-site-specific recombination system is employed. The natural flippase recombinase gene, flp, is derived from the 2 μm plasmid of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ; FRT stands for “Flippase recombinase Recognition Target.” The FRT comprises 34 base pairs (bp/bps): SEQ ID NO: 12, and is divided into two regions. The first consecutive 13 bps and last 13 consecutive bps belong to a complementary region, which is the FLP recognition site. The central 8 bps are named as the core region, which is asymmetric. FLP recognizes two identical FRT in the same direction and flip-out the gene flanked by the two FRT to accomplish specific gene recombination. The possibility of the occurrence of recombination based on two non-identical FRTs is extreme low (Storici et al. 1999 , Yeast  15, 271-283). 
 Due to the lack of thermotolerant  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  having glucose fermentation efficiency higher than 95% and method for making same, it is apparent that there is a present need for such means to lower the production cost of cellulosic biomass ethanol. 
 To overcome the shortcomings that the prior art fails to provide a thermotolerant yeast and fails to lower the production cost for biomass ethanol, the present invention provides a thermotolerant yeast with a substitute heat shock protein 104 promoter to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The main objective of the invention is to provide a new recombinant  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  having an ethanol production ratio higher than 95% based on fermentation of glucose at a temperature higher than 42° C. 
 The method for making the yeast in accordance with the present invention comprises the step of replacing the regulation region upstream of the hsp104 gene in the genome of the yeast, so as to accelerate and prolong the expression span of hsp104 gene and enhance the capability of the yeast to ferment and produce ethanol in a high-temperature environment. 
 The yeast in accordance with the present invention has been deposited in China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC) on Jun. 28, 2012, confirmed viable on Jul. 5, 2012, and assigned a deposit designation “CCTCC M 2012254,” which is a recombinant yeast substrain derived from the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strain sake yeast Kyokai 6. CCTCC is an International Depository Authority (IDA) under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty having a place of business at Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072 P. R.

 The deposited yeast deposited as deposit CCTCC M 2012254 in CCTCC is capable of fermenting glucose at a temperature higher than 42° C. to produce ethanol, or biomass ethanol, wherein the ethanol production ratio based on fermentation of glucose is higher than 97%.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 An embodying of the present invention first involves in constructing a specific targeted integration of kanamycin resistance-associated non-selectable DNA promoter exchange platform, which employs linear DNA transformation to replace the upstream regulation region of hsp104 gene in yeast genome, so as to accelerate and prolong the expression span of hsp104 gene and enhance the capability of the yeast to ferment and produce ethanol at a high-temperature. 
 As shown in  FIG. 1 , the construction of plasmid pTZ57R/T for a yeast genome exchange platform using FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  (40 homo) employs antibiotic resistance gene KanMX6 with a sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 and uses plasmid pYC6ct-KanMX6 and the chromosome of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strain s288c as PCR templates accompanying SEQ ID NOs: 1-7 as primers. 
 SEQ ID NO: 1 is a forward primer for KanMX6 and SEQ ID NO: 2 is a backward primer for KanMX6, while SEQ ID NO: 3 is a forward primer for hsp26 and SEQ ID NO: 4 is a backward primer for hsp26. A sequence having KanMX6 for resistance against kanamycin, a fragment containing KanMX6 and the regulation region of hsp26 flanked by two FRT sequences is obtained by using the two of the aforementioned primer pairs. The sequence of KanMX6 is first integrated into vector yT&A and the regulation region of hsp26 (HSP26 R ) digested with XhoI and BamHI is subsequently integrated to the yT&A vector. The plasmid so constructed is named as FRT-KanMX6-FRT-HSP26 R  yT&A. 
 In order to lower the rate of homologous recombination between designed plasmid and the FRT sequence of the  yeast  2 μm plasmid, a fragment containing KanMX6 flanked by FRT having mutated FRT core regions is obtained by using SEQ ID NO: 5 as the forward primer for FRT B  and SEQ ID NO: 6 as the backward primer for FRT B . The fragment containing KanMX6 is first integrated into vector yT&A and the regulation region of hsp26 (HSP26 R ) digested with XhoI and BamHI is subsequently integrated to the yT&A vector. The plasmid constructed as aforementioned is named as FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  yT&A. 
 The FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  fragment is further manipulated as being flanked by two homologous sequences (40 homo) in order to exchange with the upstream regulation region of hsp104 gene. 
 FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  yT&A is then cleaved by BamHI to be linear DNA. SEQ ID NO: 7 is a forward primer for adding a homologous sequence and SEQ ID NO: 8 is a backward primer for adding another homologous sequence, both homologous sequences, though of different sequences, are 40 bps in length and abbreviated “40 homo.” PCR with the primer pair, SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8, gives a DNA fragment that is further integrated into a TA-cloning vector pTZ57R/T. The plasmid constructed with the foregoing process is named as FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  (40 homo) pTZ57R/T. 
 Before transformating a yeast strain of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Kyokai strain series with plasmid FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  (40 homo) pTZ57R/T with, e.g., lithium acetate, the plasmid is first cleaved with Cail to be linear DNA. The linear DNA made from the plasmid is used to transform  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strains  Kyokai  6 and s288C. The colonies with successfully replaced DNA, i.e.,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  substrains of which upstream regulation region of hsp104 has been replaced with the FRT B -KanMX6-FRT B -HSP26 R  fragment, are confirmed by colony PCR. The  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  substrain, which is derived from the  Kyokai  6 strain, having sequences successfully replaced with a PCR primer pair designed based on the peripheral sequence of the replaced DNA fragment, i.e., SEQ ID NOs: 10 and 11, is named as Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan. 
 The thermotolerance of Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan is tested using spot assay. Being incubated in yeast peptone dextrose agar plate (YPD agar plate) at 30 to 46° C. for 16 hours, Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan demonstrates superior thermotolerance than  Kyokai  6 from which it is originated. When shake flask fermenting at 42° C. in an YPD medium, Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan reaches a saturated cell density in 7 hours, which indicates a faster growth rate than  Kyokai  6. In addition, only at the 8-hour time point does Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan give trace ethanol, which may be attributed to the leak-in of oxygen to the shake flask when sampling and the consumption of ethanol by Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan that performs respiration at a higher rate. When fermented with fermenter in 5 L of YPD at 42° C., Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan grows faster than  Kyokai  6. Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan consumes 80 g/L glucose in 14 hours and produce ethanol based on glucose at an ethanol production ratio of 97%.

The washing alcohol was removed and 35 μL of TE buffer (pH 8) was used to dissolve the DNA. The DNA solution was than stored at −20° C.

Trace yeast from a colony on the aforementioned solid medium was transferred in to the mixture in the microcentrifuge tube and was incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. 2 μL of the incubated suspension was used for PCR. 
 As shown in  FIG. 6 , the substrain derived from  Kyokai  6 strain whose DNA was successfully replaced represented a PCR product being a 2.5 kb DNA fragment. The substrain was named Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan, based on which a deposit, CCTCC M 2012254, has been made in an IDA, i.e., CCTCC. 
 EXAMPLE 9 
 The instant example demonstrates the thermotolerance spot assay for yeast. 
 Yeast substrain Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan was picked with a toothpick into 1.5 mL of YPD medium and cultivated submerged. When OD 600  value of the suspension became 2 to 4, the suspension was 10-fold diluted and re-activated. 3 hours later, OD 600  value was further measured and adjusted to 0.3 with YP medium. A suspension so adjusted was defined a 1× suspension. 100 μL of 1× suspension was 10-fold diluted and defined as a 10 −1 × suspension. With similar methods, 10 −2 ×, 10 −3 × and 10 −4 × suspensions were made. 10-μL aliquots of the aforementioned suspensions of different concentrations was serially dropped on YPD solid mediums and respectively incubated at 30° C., 37° C., 40° C., 42° C., 44° C. and 46° C. for 16 hours. As shown in  FIG. 7 , Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan demonstrated superior thermotolerance than the  Kyokai  6 strain from which it is derived from. 
 EXAMPLE 10 
 The instant example demonstrates the shake flask fermentation experiment at 42° C. 
 With a toothpick or similar tool, trace Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan was taken to 5 mL of YPD medium to perform submerged cultivation. When the OD 600  value of the cultivation medium had been higher than 7, the cultivation medium was diluted 10-fold diluted and re-activated for 3 hours. The OD 600  value was measured again and the cultivation medium was adjusted with YPD medium that the glucose concentration was 80 g/L and the OD value was 0.3. Shake flask fermentation was performed at 42° C. At every 1-hour interval, two 1-mL samples were taken from the fermentation suspension. One of the 1-mL sample of each time point was used for OD values measurement. The other 1-mL sample of each time point was centrifuged at 13000 rpm, from which supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter, so as to measure the glucose concentration and ethanol concentration with HPLC. 
 As shown in  FIG. 8 , when performing shake flask fermenting at 42° C. in an YPD medium, Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan reached a saturated cell density in 7 hours, which indicated a faster growth rate than  Kyokai  6. In addition, only at the 8-hour time point did Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan give trace ethanol, which may be attributed to the leak-in of oxygen into the shake flask when sampling and the consumption of ethanol by Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan that performs respiration at a higher rate. 
 EXAMPLE 11 
 The instant example demonstrates the fermentation experiment using fermenters at 42° C. 
 With a toothpick or similar tool, Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan that had grown to a rod or string shape was submitted to 100 mL of YPD medium to perform submerged cultivation. When the OD 600  value of the cultivation medium had been higher than 7, the cultivation medium was diluted that the OD 600  value returned to 7, wherein the total volume was 1000 mL 3 L of glucose solution containing 400 g of glucose and 1 L of 4× concentration YP medium were added into the fermenter. The fermenter was kept in a condition that its agitator were rotating at 200 rpm, the temperature was 42° C. and the pH value was 5. 
 When the condition became stable, 100 mL medium having an OD of 7 was poured in. After 2 minutes of stirring, 20 mL of fermentation suspension was taken as a O-hour sample. 10 mL of the fermentation suspension sample was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was taken and filtered with a 0.22 μm filter and the concentrations of glucose and ethanol were measured with HPLC. 10 mL of DI water was added to resuspend the pellet. The resuspended suspension was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes, after which the supernatant was removed and 10 mL DI water was added to resuspend the pellet. 1 mL of the suspension was used to measure OD value and the rest was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 minutes and, having the supernatant removed, stored at −80° C. Foregoing sampling and measurement was repeated at time points until the HPLC measured glucose concentration dropped to 0. 
 As shown in  FIG. 9 , Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan grew faster than  Kyokai  6 and consumed 80 g/L glucose in 14 hours. The ethanol production ratio of Kyokai 6-HSP104 R /26 R  Kan based on glucose was as high as 97%.
