More specifically, the present invention relates to a xylitol production method, in which an inconvenience that concentration of dissolved oxygen in a xylitol-producing medium should be maintained at a very low level can.be eliminated through the use of a xylitol dehydrogenaseinactivated mutant of cnadida tropicalis, and the production of byproduct arabitol, which is produced when using a biomass as a substrate and adversely affects the yield of xylitol, can be significantly reduced through the use of Candida tropicalis mutant ara-89 (KCTC 11136bp), having an inhibited activity of .arabinose reductase converting arabinose to arabitol, thus increasing the production of xylitol, as well as xylitol produced by the method.

 C' Description of the Prior Art Xylitol, a five-carbon sugar alcohol, has high Cn sweetening power, and thus is widely used as a functional O 5 sugar substitute for sugar. Because xylitol is found 
 C 
 0 naturally in a variety of fruits or vegetables in very small amounts, the extraction of xylitol from fruits or vegetables is not industrially advantageous. For this reason, xylitol is produced by a chemical method of reducing a hemicellulose hydrolyzate rich in xylose. 
 However, in the chemical method, it is difficult to isolate and purify xylose or xylitol from other hydrolyzates occurring in the hemicellulose moiety, a lot of costs are incurred and the yield of xylitol is as low as about 60%. Also, it is a high-temperature and high-pressure employing alkali, which causes problems of risk and waste. 
 In recent attempts to overcome such shortcoming, biological methods for producing xylitol have been actively studied. Korean Patent Registration No. 1999819 discloses a method of producing xylitol, in which new strain Candida tropicalis is cultured in a medium, containing xylose, a nitrogen source and inorganic salts, to convert xylose to xylitol. Also, PCT International Patent Publication No. 
 W088/05467 discloses a method of producing xylitol from a high concentration of xylose by culturing Candida 2 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 N0.513 P005 ;1 0 0 -s guillieamondii under conditions employing limited aeration. 
 i Such biological methods can employ, as a raw material, a relatively low purity of xylose ccmpared to the chemical c methods and are safe and environment-friendly, because the 5 processes themselves are carried out at room temperature 0 and atmospheric. pressure. Thus, studies focused on the o production of xylitol by a variety of bacteria, yeasts, Sfungi and recombinant yeasts have been conducted to produce xylitol in high productivity and high yield (Winkelhausen, EB et al., J. Ferment. Bioeng- 86:1-14, 1998; Granstr6m, T. 
 B. et al., Appl. Microbiol- Biotechnol. 74:277-281, 2007). 
 However, bacteria and recombinant yeast strains were not suitable for the production of xylitol, because they showed a weak metabolic activity of producing xylose or low efficiency. However, among yeast strains, Candida sp strains are known as strains suitable for the biological production of xylitol, because they show high xylitol productivity and yield compared to other microorganisms. 
 According to studies conducted to date, it is known that, as shown in FIG. 1, Candida sp strains, such as C. 
 guillezmondi, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis, convert xylose, absorbed from cells, to xylitol by xylose reductase, and converts xylitol to xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase. Xylulose is then converted to phosphate by xylulokinase, and xylulose-5 -phosphate is used 3 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 NO.513 006 0 O0 ;Z for the growth and maintenance of cells through a pentose phosphate pathway (see Laplace, J.

 Microbiol. Biotechnol., 36:158-162, 1991; Hahn-Hagerdal, B. 
 M et al., Enzyme Microb. Technol., 16:933-943, 1994). That O 5 is, xylitol-producing strains use xylose as a carbon source c o for cell growth. Xylitol converted from xylose by xylose reductase is then converted to xylulose by xylitol C dehydrogenase, and in this case, when the aeration of the medium is limited such that the concentration of dissolved oxygen is maintained as .low as intracellular redox imbalance is incurred to reduce the supply of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a cofactor required by xylitol dehydrogenase and inhibit the conversion of xylitol to xylulose. As a result, xylitol is accumulated in cells and media, and thus xylitol is produced from xylose in a yield of 60-80%. That is, in the prior technology of producing xylitol using xylitolproducing strains, it is necessary to limit aeration to maintain the concentration of dissolved oxygen at a low level. Thus, studies focused on enhancing the productivity and yield of xylitol by limiting the aeration of medium to maintain the concentration of dissolved oxygen at a low level so as to intentionally induce intracellular redox imbalance have been actively conducted (see Kim, S- Y. et.

 FIG. 2 is a genetic map of a pXYL2-Ura3 vector for c n constructing a xylitol dehydrogenase-inactivated mutant of Candida tropicalis, according to a preferred embodiment of C the present invention. 
 SA process of constructing a Candida tropicalis mutant C lacking the activity of xylitol dehydrogenase and producing xylitol using the constructed mutant is as follows. 
 When a pXYL2-Tra3 transformation vector is introduced into Candida tropicalis, a xylitol denydrogenase gene is selectively removed through an intracellular mechanism of homologous recombination, and thus a transformed strain, which cannot grow in a medium containing only xylose as a carbon source, can be constructed. 
 In the xylitol dehydrogenase inactivated mutant of candida tropicalis, because xylitol converted from xylose is no longer used for cell growth, xylose cannot be used as a carbon source, and thus cell growth does not occur. Only when a carbon source such as glycerol or glucose other than xylose is added to medium, cells can grow using the carbon source. Thus, xylose is used only as a substrate for xylitol production, and the carbon source is used to grow cells and supply nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-reduced form (NADPH) as a cofactor required by 11 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 N0.513 D014 0 0 xylose reductase. In particular, in the case of the xylitol dehydrogenase-inactivated mutant, because there is no need to induce redox imbalance for the enhancement of M xylitol yield and production, unlike the existing strain, e 5 it was anticipated that the concentration of dissolved 0 oxygen in a culture process would not need to be controlled o to a low level. Also, because yeast strains can use 0 glycerol as a carbon source under aerobic conditions, it was anticipated that, when glycerol is used as a cosubstrate, cell growth rate and NADPH supply rate can be influenced by aeration rate. 
 Thus, the xylitol dehydrogenase-inactivated mutant of Candida twpicalis was inoculated into a xylitol-producing medium containing xylose, glycerol, yeast extract, KH 2 
 PO 
 4 and MgSO 4 7H20, and experiments for producing xylitol in various aeration conditions were carried out. The aeration rate was controlled by the agitation speed of an agitator. 
 The experimental results showed that xylitol production rate was high when the agitation speed was higher than a given level, that is, when aeration rate was high. This suggests that the assimilation of glycerol in cells is affected by aeration rate, and an increase in aeration rate leads to an increase in the assimilation of glycerol and an increase in the supply rate of NADPH, resulting in an 12 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 N0.513 9015 ;1

 increase in xylitol productivity. Also, the yield of Cq xylitol from xylose was constant in a range of 97-98% regardless of aeration rate, suggesting that xylitol was produced in a theoretical yield of almost 100%, because n 5 xylitol dehydrogenase activity was eliminated regardless of C intracellular redox imbalance. 
 o Biomasses, such as corncobs, sugar cane stems, coconut 0 Ci byproducts and Betula platyphylla var. japonica, are rich in hemicelluloses including xylose, arabinose and glucose, and particularly, have a high content of xylose. Thus, hydrolyzates of the biomasses can be used directly for the production of xylitol. In the present invention, xylitol was produced using, as a substrate, a corncob hydrolysate consisting of 83.5% xylose, 5.3% glucose and 11.2% arabinose, and using glycerol as a co-substrate. The xylitol-producing strain consumed all of glucose contained in the hydrolyzate for cell growth and showed a xylitol yield of 97.2% and a xylitol productivity of 3.24 g/L/h. 
 Moreover, a high concentration of xylitol was produced using fed-batch culture while the concentration of xylose in the medium was maintained at less than 100 g/L, because a high xylose concentration of more than 100 g/L would be unfavorable for cell growth and xylitol production. During the production of xylitol, a mixture of a corncob hydrolyzate as a xylose raw material with glycerol as a 13 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 N0. 513 P016 ;1 0 0 C carbon source for cell growth and NADPH supply was continuously supplied. As a result, xylitol was produced in a yield of 97% and a productivity of 2.67 g/L/h. 
 en Glucose contained in the corncob hydrolyzate was completely O 5 consumed during the cell culture process. Also, 15.2 g/L Scorresponding to 57% of the total concentration (26.5 g/L) Sof arabinose added remained as arabinose, and 11.3 g/L C corresponding to 43% was converted to arabitol. 
 Hereinafter, the inventive method of producing a high yield of xylitol using arabinose reductase-inhibited mutant of Candida tropical s ara-89 (KCTC 11136bp) will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. 
 FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing a method of producing xylitol using xylitol dehydrogenase inactivated and arabinose reductase-inhibited mutant of Candida tropicalis (KCTC 11136bp), according to a preferred entodiment of the present invention. 
 The mutant ara-89 (KCTC l1136bp) having an inhibited activity of arabinose reductase converting arabinose to arabitol was selected from xylitol dehydrogenaseinactivated mutants of Candida tropicalis using, as an alkylating agent, methanesulfonic acid ehtylester (EMS) inducing random mutagenesis. That is, the present inventors have developed a mutant strain in which a 14 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HPLFORD CO 4 62837999 NO.513 3017 ;1 0 0 h- cellular metabolic process of converting arabinose to arabitol was inhibited by mutation to reduce arabitol productivity. The enzymatic activities of the mutant c strain were measured and, as a result, the activity of O 5 xylose reductase converting xylose to xylitol was the same as that of the parent strain, whereas the activity of Sarabonose reductase converting arabinose to arabitol was 0 decreased by 63%. 
 Also, xylitol production was carried out through fedbatch culture using the mutant strain and, as a result, xylitol was produced in a yield of 97% with a productivity of 2.80 g/L/h. Glucose contained in the corncob hydrolyzate was completely consumed during the culture process. In addition, 23.7 g/L corresponding to 85% of the total amount (27.9 g/1) of arabinose added, remained as arabinose, and 4.2 g/L corresponding to 15% was converted to arabitol. 
 Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to examples.

Then, a strain, which did not grow on the xylose-containing solid medium and grew 0 O only on the glucose-containing solid medium, was selected, ci thus obtaining xylitol dehydrogenase-inactivated mutant of Candida tropicalis.

Although not shown in Table above, the production of xylitol was no longer increased at an agitation speed higher than 500 rpm. 
 Such results suggest that the assimilation rate of glycerol in cells is affected by aeration rate, and until 19 COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 N0.513 3022 0 0 dissolved oxygen is sufficient, an increase in oxygen transfer rate leads to an increase in the assimilation rate of glycerol and an increase in NADPH supply rate, resulting in an increase in xylitol production rate. Also, the production yield of xylitol from xylose was constant in a 0q range of 97-98% independent of aeration rate, suggesting o that xylitol was produced in a theoretical yield of almost 0 Ci 100%, because xylitol dehydrogenase activity was eliminated regardless of intracellular redox imbalance. 
 Thus, when the xylitol-porducing strain was used to produce xylitol, xylitol could be produced even in high productivity and a theoretical yield of almost 100% in an industrial large-scale fermenter, because there was no need to maintain the dissolved oxygen level as low as 0.5-2.0%- Also, when the yeast strain is cultured in a low-dissolvedoxygen condition, byproducts such as ethanol and glycerol, which reduce xylitol yield and inhibit xylitol purification and crystallization, will be produced, whereas, in the case of the xylitol dehydrogenase gene-disrupted mutant strain, a more efficient process could be constructed, because a high level of dissolved oxygen could be maintained so that byproducts such as ethanol and glycerol were not produced. 
 Ecample 3 Xylitol was produced using a corncob hydrolyzate as a substrate.

Then, the changes in dry cell weight and xylose, glucose, arabinose, arabitol, glycerol and xylitol concentrations with the passage of time were measured. The measurement of dry cell weight and xylose, glucose, arabinose, arabitol, glycerol and xylitol concentrations was carried out in the same manner as described in Example 2.

Also, xylitol was produced in an amount of 97.2 g/L for 30 hours using, as a substrate, xylose contained in the corncob hydrolyzate in a large amount, and some of arabinose was converted to arabitol. Herein, xylitol yield was 97.2%, and xylitol productivity was 3.24 g/L/h. 
 In this Example, the xylitol yield was the same as the case of using pure xylose, and the xylitol productivity was similar thereto. Thus, when an inexpensive biomass hydrolyzate rather than pure xylose is used as a substrate for xylitol production, it will be advantageous for increasing the economy of production technology and will be environment-friendly, because biomass waste is recycled.

Arabitol, a five-carbon sugar alcohol like 5 xylitol, is a byproduct, which has a molecular structure 0 and physical properties, similar to those of xylitol, and Sthus interferes with purification and crystallization 0 Ci processes in xylitol production so as to reduce xylitol production yield. When bicaass hydrolyzates as inexpensive xylose sources are used for the production of xylose, a given amount of arabitol will be produced, and when the amount thereof is higher than a given concentration, it will reduce xylitol production yield. For this reason, it is required to inhibit arabitol production. 
 Example On the basis of the results of Example 4, a novel xylitol-producing strain, in which a cellular metabolic process of converting arabinose to arabitol was inhibited, was developed from the xylitol dehydrogenase-inactivated nmtant of Candida ttrpicalis BS-xdhl using methanesulfonic acid ethylester (EMS) as an alkylating agent. 
 For this purpose, the xylitol dehydrogenase-inactivated mutant of Candida tropicalis BS-xdhl was inoculated in 3 ml of YM medium (20 g/L glucose, 3 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L malt extract and 5 g/L of bacto-peptone 5g/L) and was COMS ID No: SBMI-07973456 Received by IP Australia: Time 21:33 Date 2007-06-29 29/06/2007 22:23 HALFORD CO 4 62837999 N0.513 P028 0 0 cultured at 30 OC for 24 hours with shaking at 200 rpm.
