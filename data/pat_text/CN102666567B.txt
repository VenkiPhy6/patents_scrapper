 Background 
 PET (positron emission tomography) (PET) has become one of most important functional imaging pattern in diagnostic medicine, there is high sensitivity (fmol), high resolving power (4-10mm) and can by suitably quantitative tissue accumulation (tissue accretion) (Volkow etc., 1988,1988, Am.J.Physiol.Imaging 3:142).Although [
         18 f] the fluoro-D-Glucose of 2-deoxidation-2-([
         18 f] FDG) be the most widely used functional imaging agent (Fletcher etc. in oncology, 2008, J.Nucl.Med.49:480), but there are great interest (Torigian etc. at other tagged compound of development function imaging to supplement or to promote in anatomy imaging method, 2007, CA Cancer J.Clin.57:206), the combined PET/ computed tomography systems particularly used at present.Therefore, need that there is the simple and easy method making the radionuclide of positron radiation and various biology and medical target molecular conjugate.
       
 Peptide or other small molecules can use positron emitter
         18 f,
         64 cu,
         11 c,
         66 ga,
         68 ga,
         76 br,
         94 mTc,
         86 y and
         124 i marks.The isotopic lower emitted energy of PET expects, the shortest with the distance making positron divide a word with a hyphen at the end of a line from target site before producing by two 511keV gamma-rays of PET camera imaging.The isotropic substance of many transmitting positron also has other and launches in its decay chain, such as gamma-rays, alpha-particle or beta-particle.Also expect that having is the PET isotropic substance of pure electron emitter, minimizes to make any problems with dosimetry.The isotopic transformation period is also important, because the transformation period is sufficiently long, to make isotropic substance be connected to targeted molecular, assay products, is injected into patient, and product is located, from non-target tissue's removing also then imaging.If the transformation period is oversize, then specific activity may not be high to being enough to the required enough photons that get a distinct image, and if the transformation period too short, then produce, commercial distribution and the time needed for bio distribution may be not enough.Due to the positron radiation energy that it is lower, there is not side emission and suitable transformation period,
         18 f (Î²
         + 635keV 97%, t
         1/2 110 minutes) be that the most widely used PET launches one of isotropic substance.
       
 Routinely,
         18 f is by being bonded to carbon atom and being connected to compound (Miller etc., 2008, Angew Chem Int Ed 47:8998-9033), but also report and be connected to silicon (Shirrmacher etc., 2007, Bioconj Chem 18:2085-89; Hohne etc., 2008, Bioconj Chem 19:1871-79) and boron (Ting etc., 2008, Fluorine Chem129:349-58).Be bonded to carbon and be usually directed to multistep synthesis, comprise multiple purification step, this is problematic for the isotropic substance with 110 minute transformation period.At present for peptide
         18 f marking method generally includes the low specific activity reagent of mark, and HPLC purified reagent, is then conjugated to target peptide.Conjugate usually after puting together again purifying with obtain expect mark peptide specific activity.
       
 An example is the (J.Nucl.Med.2004 such as Poethko; Marking method 45:892-902), wherein first 4-[18F] fluorobenzaldehyde is synthesized and purifying (Wilson etc., J.LabeledCompounds and Radiopharm.1990; XXVIII:1189-1199), then peptide is conjugated to.Then be used for promotion by HPLC purified peptide conjugate put together excessive peptide completely to remove.Other example comprises uses following mass signatures: succinyl-[
         18 f] fluorinated acid ester (SFB) (such as, Vaidyanathan etc., 1992, Int.J.Rad.Appl.Instrum.B 19:275), other acyl compounds (Tada etc., 1989, Labeled Compd.Radiopharm.XXVII:1317; Wester etc., 1996, Nucl.Med.Biol.23:365; Guhlke etc., 1994, Nucl.MEd.Biol 21:819) or click chemistry adducts (Li etc., 2007, Bioconjugate Chem.18:1987).Total synthesis and the preparation time range of these methods are 1-3 hour, and the most of the time is for marking the HPLC purifying of peptide to obtain the specific activity in body needed for target.For the transformation period of 2 hours, make
         18 all operations needed for F is connected with peptide is very large burden.These methods also operate tediously long and need to use specialized designs to produce the equipment of marked product and/or to need the effort of special speciality chemical personnel.They are also unfavorable for conventional preparing for the test kit of clinical setting.
       
 Need simple fast
         18 f marks the method for targeting moiety (such as protein or peptide), described method produces and is used for being applicable to detecting and/or the specific activity of imaging and the target construct of body internal stability, reduces to greatest extent the demand of Special Equipment or height start-up simultaneously and reduce operator to be exposed to high level radiation.More preferably, the targeting peptides needing the 18F for the preparation of pre-targeting technology to mark.Also need to provide the pre-packaged test kit of the composition carried out needed for this novel method.

   18 f labeling technique
       
 With
         18 the various technology of F tagged molecule are that oneself knows.Table 1 lists several character of fluoridizing program compared with widespread reports.Often comprised by the peptide of carbon markings and pass through nucleophilic substitution
         18 f-is bonded to prothetic group, and usually with 2 or 3 steps, wherein said prothetic group is labeled and purifying, is connected to compound, and then purifying.This general method is for being connected prothetic group (Marik etc., 2006, Bioconjug Chem 17:1017-21 through amido linkage, aldehyde with " click chemistry "; Poethko etc., 2004, J Nucl Med 45:892-902; Li etc., 2007, BioconjugChem 18:989-93).It is 4-that modal amido linkage forms reagent
         18 f fluorinated acid N-succinimide ester (
         18 f-SFB), but tested other groups many (Marik etc., 2006).In some cases, such as use is worked as
         18 when the active ester acid amides of F-mark forms group, some group protected during linked reaction on peptide may be necessary, afterwards by they cracking.Should
         18 the synthesis of F-SFB reagent and subsequently with the puting together the many synthesis steps of needs and expend about 2-3 hour of peptide.
       
 It is simpler, more effective that Poethko etc. (2004) develop one

         18 f-tagged molecule is connected to peptide (Li etc., 2007; Glaser and Arstad, 2007, Bioconjug Chem 18:989-93).Reaction between trinitride with acetylene group forms triazole and is connected, and this connection is highly stable and effectively formation and without the need to protecting group on peptide.Use centrifugal drying step, click chemistry produced with good yield (~ 50%) in about 75-90 minute
         18 the peptide of F-mark.

   18 the nearest method that F is bonded to silicon uses isotopic exchange to use
         18 f replaces
         19 f (Shirrmacher etc., 2007).Carry out at room temperature 10 minutes, this reaction produces has high specific activity (225-680GBq/ Î¼m of ol; 6,100-18,400Ci/mmol)
         18 f-aldehyde prothetic group.Subsequently will
         18 the aldehyde of F mark is conjugated to peptide and carries out purifying by HPLC, and within 40 minutes (comprising centrifugal drying), obtain the peptide of the mark of purifying with about 55% yield.The method was modified to a one-step process (Hohne etc., 2008) by silicon being incorporated to peptide before labeled reactant afterwards.But, use
         18 the biodistribution research display of F-silicon-bombesin derivative in mouse, bone resorption increases in time (0.5h 1.35 Â± 0.47% injected dose (ID)/g and 4.0h5.14 Â± 2.71%ID/g), shows
         18 f discharges from peptide, because oneself knows unconjugated
         18 f concentrates on (Hohne etc., 2008) in bone.The HPLC of urine analyzes in display void volume a large amount of
         18 f activity, infers that this is owing to discharging from peptide
         18 f-fluorine anion.Therefore, seem
         18 f-silicon tagged molecule is unstable in serum.There was reported a large amount of hepatobiliary excretion, owing to
         18 the lipotropy of F-silicon-bound substrates, therefore needs following derivative to have more wetting ability.Be investigated and make
         18 f is connected to the method for boron; But existing method produces the conjugate (Ting etc., 2008) with low specific activity.
       
 Antibody and peptide and the conventional coupling of radioactive metal, had quantitative yield (Meares etc., 1984, Acc Chem Res 17:202-209 usually in 15 minutes; Scheinberg etc., 1982, Science 215:1511-13).In order to PET imaging,
         64 cu and
         68 ga is bonded to peptide by sequestrant, and has shown goodish PET-imaging character (Heppler etc., 2000, CurrentMed Chem 7:971-94).Because fluorochemical is in conjunction with most of metal, we attempt to determine
         18 whether F-metal composite can be bonded to sequestrant (Tewson, 1989, the NuclMed Biol.16:533-51 on targeted molecular; Martin, 1996, Coordination Chem Rev 141:23-32).We are absorbed in Al
         18 the combination of F mixture, because aluminum fluoride can relatively stable (Li, 2003, Crit Rev Oral Biol Med 14:100-114 in vivo; Antonny etc., 1992, JBiol Chem 267:6710-18).Initial research shows the method preparation and uses target on cancer in bi-specific antibody (bsMAb) pre-targeting system body

 The all difficulties in the low yield of technology, the necessity of purifying, low stability or labour intensive etc. are revealed for generation of polyspecific or two these technique tables of relying on heterogenetic antibody.Recently, utilize and be called the technology of " stopping and locking " (DNL) (being hereafter described in more detail) to produce the combination of in fact any required antibody, antibody fragment and other effector molecule (see such as, U.S. Patent Application Publication No.20060228357,20060228300,20070086942,20070140966 and 20070264265, is incorporated to by reference by the embodiment part of each public announcement of a patent application herein).DNL technology makes the assembling of monospecific, dual specific or multi-specificity antibody, combine as naked antibody moiety or with other effector molecule multiple, described effector molecule is such as immunomodulator, enzyme, chemotherapeutic, chemokine, cytokine, diagnostic reagent, therapeutical agent, radionuclide, preparation, anti-angiogenic agent, somatomedin, oligonucleotide, hormone, peptide, toxin, short apoptosis agent or its combination.This area oneself know that any technology for the preparation of dual specific or multi-specificity antibody can be used for implementing claimed method herein. 
 Stop and locking (DNL) 
 In preferred embodiments, dual specific or multi-specificity antibody or other construct can use stop and lock-in techniques generation (see such as, U.S. Patent No. 7,550,143,7,521,056,7,534,866,7,527,787 and 7,666,400, the embodiment part of each patent is being incorporated to herein by reference).DNL method utilizes specific protein/protein interaction (Baillie etc., the FEBS Letters.2005 occurred between adjustment (R) subunit of cAMP-deopendent protein kinase (PKA) and the anchoring domain (AD) of A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP); 579:3264.Wong and Scott, Nat.Rev.Mol.Cell Biol.2004; 5:959).From rabbit skeletal muscle, be separated PKA first in nineteen sixty-eight, play the role of a nucleus in one of signal transduction pathway that described PKA is triggered the most sufficient the combination with R subunit by second messenger cAMP of research (Walsh etc., J.Biol.Chem.1968; 243:3763).Holoenzyme structure is made up of two catalytic subunits, remains inactive form (Taylor, J.Biol.Chem.1989 by R subunit; 264:8443).Find that the isozyme of PKA has the R subunit (RI and RII) of two types, and every type have Î± and Î² isotype (Scott, Pharmacol.Ther.1991; 50:123).R subunit is only separated as stablizing dimer, and has shown dimerization domain and form (Newlon etc., Nat.Struct.Biol.1999 by front 44 n terminal residues; 6:222).The combination of cAMP and R subunit causes the release of the active catalytic subunit of the activity of serine/threonine kinases of wide spectrum, and described subunit is stopped by PKA compartmentation via itself and AKAP and is oriented to selected substrate (Scott etc., J.Biol.Chem.1990; 265:21561). 
 (Lohmann etc., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci USA.1984 after characterizing first AKAP (microtubule associated proteins-1B) since 1984; 81:6723); identified in the species of scope from yeast to people have various structure more than 50 kinds of AKAP; it is positioned various Subcellular location; comprise plasma membrane, actin cytoskeleton, nucleus, plastosome and endoplasmic reticulum (Wong and Scott, Nat.Rev.Mol.Cell Biol.2004; 5:959).AKAP is amphipathic helix (Carr etc., the J.Biol.Chem.1991 of 14-18 residue for the AD of PKA; 266:14188).In individual AKAP, the aminoacid sequence of AD has a great difference, and the binding affinity scope wherein reported RII dimer is 2 to 90nM (Alto etc., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA.2003; 100:4445).AKAP will only in conjunction with dimer R subunit.People RII Î±, AD are attached to hydrophobic surface (Colledge and Scott, the Trends Cell Biol.1999 formed by 23 n terminal residues; 6:216).Therefore, the dimerization domain of people RII Î± and AKAP binding domains are all positioned (Newlon etc., Nat.Struct.Biol.1999 in identical N-end 44 aminoacid sequence; 6:222; Newlon etc., EMBO are J.2001; 20:1651), it is referred to herein as DDD. 
 We have developed and utilize the AD of DDD with AKAP of people RII Î± as excellent joint module to the platform technology for two entities at hereinafter referred to as A with B being stopped into non-covalent complex, described non-covalent complex can be locked into promote disulfide formation the structure stablized and be connected by cysteine residues is introduced DDD with AD in tactful position further.The general method " stopping and locking " method is as follows.Entity A builds by DDD sequence being connected with A precursor, produces the first component at hereinafter referred to as a.Because DDD sequence will affect dimeric spontaneous formation, therefore A will be by a
         2 form.Entity B builds by AD sequence being connected with the precursor of B, produces the second component at hereinafter referred to as b.A
         2 in the dimer motif of DDD that contains will produce the docking site be used in conjunction with the AD sequence contained in b, thus promote a
         2 with b be easy to associate with formed by a
         2 the two component trimer compositions that b is formed.This binding events by following reaction to become irreversible via disulphide bridges covalent tethering two entities, this principle based on effective partial concn and effectively occurring, because initial binding interactions will make the reactive thiol group close (Chimura etc., the Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA.2001 that are placed on DDD and AD; 98:8480) connect with locus specificity.Use the various combinations of joint, adaptation module (adaptor module) and precursor, can produce and the multiple DNL construct using different chemical to measure, include but not limited to that dimer, tripolymer, the tetramer, pentamer and six aggressiveness DNL constructs are (see such as, U.S. Patent No. 7,550,143,7,521,056,7,534,866,7,527,787 and 7,666,400).
       
 By connecting DDD and AD away from the functional group of two precursors, this locus specificity connects the original activity of also expection reservation two precursors.The method is modular in nature, and can be applied to locus specificity potentially and covalently connect many kinds of substance, comprises peptide, protein, antibody, antibody fragment and has other extensively active effector part.The fusion rotein method of the effector utilizing structure AD and DDD described in Examples below to put together, can be incorporated to DNL construct by fact any albumen or peptide.But this technology is not restrictive and can utilizes other conjugation methods. 
 Oneself knows that many methods are for the preparation of fusion rotein, comprises nucleic acid synthesis, hybridization and/or amplification with the synthesis double-strandednucleic acid producing encoding target fusion rotein.This type of double-strandednucleic acid can by the expression vector (see such as Sambrook etc., Molecular Cloning, A laboratory manual, 2nd edition, 1989) of standard molecular biological technique insertion for generation of fusion rotein.In this type of preferred embodiment, AD and/or DDD part can be connected to N-end or the C-end of effect protein or peptide.But, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that AD or DDD part can change with the connection site of effector part, depend on the part participating in its physiologically active in the chemical property of effector part and effector part.The locus specificity of multiple effector part connects oneself technology known of this area can be used to carry out, such as, use divalence cross-linking reagent and/or other chemically conjugated technology. 
 Pre-targeting 
 Dual specific or multi-specificity antibody may be used for pre-targeting technology.Pre-targeting is multi-step process, is developed the slow blood solving direct targeting antibodies at first and removes, and this slow blood removes the less desirable toxicity of facilitating normal tissue (such as marrow).Use pre-targeting, radionuclide or other diagnostic reagent or therapeutical agent are connected with the little molecule (can target construct) of sending removed from blood in several minutes.First use that have can the pre-targeting dual specific of binding site of target construct and target antigen or multi-specificity antibody, free antibodies is removed from circulation, and then using can target construct.

 Result 
 In 1 hour, the immune PET of pre-targeting causes
         68 the height of Ga-IMP 288 in tumour and selectively targeted (10.7 Â± 3.6%ID/g), in (such as, tumor/blood 69.9 Â± 32.3), CEA-negative tumours, in (0.35 Â± 0.35%ID/g) and inflammatory muscle, (0.72 Â± 0.20%ID/g) absorbs very low in the normal tissue.Also do not have low by the tumour of TF2 pre-targeting
         68 ga-IMP 288 absorbs (0.20 Â± 0.03%ID/g).[
         18 f] FDG effectively accumulates in tumour (7.42 Â± 0.20%ID/g) and in inflammatory muscle (4.07 Â± 1.13%ID/g) and many healthy tissuess, therefore pre-targeting
         68 ga-IMP 288 provides better specificity and sensitivity.Accept after by TF2 pre-targeting
         68 ga-IMP 288 or
         18 the corresponding PET/CT image of the mouse of the IMP 449 of F-mark knows the efficient targeting of display radiolabeled peptides in subcutaneous LS174T tumour, and inflammatory muscle does not develop.On the contrary, use [
         18 f] FDG, tumour and inflammation are known description.
       
   injectivity optimizing -determine the impact of TF2bsMAb dosage on the cancer target of the IMP 288 of fixing 0.01nmol (15ng) dosage.Group 0.10,0.25,0.50 or 1.0nmol TF2 (being 16,40, the 80 or 160 Î¼ g respectively) intravenous injection of five mouse, use trace
         125 i (0.4MBq) marks.Injection
         111 latter 1 hour of In-IMP 288 (0.01nmol, 0.4MBq), determines radiolabeled bio distribution.
       
 TF2 removes fast from blood and healthy tissues.Inject latter 18 hours, the haemoconcentration under the TF2 dosage of all tests is less than 0.45%ID/g.The target of TF2 in tumour after injection 2h is 3.5%ID/g, and does not rely on TF2 dosage (data do not show).Under all TF2 dosage,
         111 in-IMP288 is effective accumulation (not shown) in tumour.Under the higher TF2 dosage, observe and improve in tumour
         111 in-IMP 288 absorbs; Under 1.0nmol TF2 dosage, reach the maximum target (26.2 Â± 3.8%ID/g) of IMP 288.Therefore, under 0.01nmol peptide dosage, maximum cancer target and tumor-blood ratio (TF2:IMP 288 mol ratios=100:1) is issued at the highest TF2 dosage of 1.0nmol.In the normal tissue, kidney has the highest
         111 in IMP 288 absorbs (1.75 Â± 0.27%ID/g), and absorption in kidney affects (not shown) by TF2 dosage.Other healthy tissuess all have low-down absorption, cause high tumour-non-tumour ratio, more than 50:1 under the TF2 dosage of all tests.
       
 For use

         18 the TF2 pre-targeting immunity PET that F-IMP 449 combines comprises twice intravenously and uses.Interval between infusion bsMAb and radiolabeled peptides uses 16h.After 16h, most of TF2 removes (haemoconcentration <1%ID/g) from blood, prevents the compound of TF2 and IMP 288 in circulation.
       
 For these research, optimize and use
         68 ga marks the program of IMP 288, produces a step mark technology.We find, to need on C18/HLB post purifying with removing
         68 ga colloid,
         68 ga colloid when peptide at 95 DEG C with more than 150GBq/nmol specific activity mark time formed.If preparation contains the colloid of little per-cent and intravenously is used, then
         68 ga colloid is assembled in the tissue of mononuclear phygocyte system (liver, spleen and marrow), infringement picture quality.
         68 ga-mark peptide can on C18-post fast purifying.For using the radio-labeling that carries out and purifying can complete in 45 minutes.
       
   68 the transformation period of Ga meets the kinetics of IMP 288 peptide in pre-targeting system: the cumulative maximum in tumour reaches in 1h.
         68 ga can one day from
         68 ge/
         68 ga maker wash-out twice, avoids the needs to on-the-spot magnetic resonance acceleator.But,
         68 the spatial resolution of the high-energy restriction acquisition image of the positron that Ga (1.9MeV) launches is 3mm, and the intrinsic resolution of micro-PET system is low to moderate 1.5mm.
       
 The radionuclide the most generally used in PET
         18 f has the transformation period (t being more conducive to pre-targeting PET imaging
         1/2 -110 minutes).NOTA-puts together peptide IMP 449 and uses as mentioned above
         18 f marks.Be similar to use
         68 ga marks, and it is a step program.Obtain the mark yield up to 50%.Al
         18 the bio distribution height of F-IMP 449 is similar to
         68 the IMP 288 of Ga-mark, shows for this marking method,
         18 f is the radionuclide of residueization.
       
 Contrary with FDG-PET, pre-targeting Placenta function is tumour-specific imaging pattern.Although reported FDG-PET in patients at the highly sensitive detected in recurrent colorectal cancer damage and specificity (Huebner etc., 2000, J Nucl Med 41:11277-89), but FDG-PET image can cause distinguishing the diagnosis predicament in malignant lesion and benign lesion, indicated by protrude mark level that inflammation is observed.On the contrary, TF2 is used
         68 ga-or
         18 high tumour-background ratio and the clear development of the CEA positive tumor of the pre-targeting immunity PET of the peptide of F-mark support the purposes of described method in clinical imaging cancer and other illness.Except detection metastatic tumor and differentiation CEA positive tumor and other damage, pre-targeting immunity PET assesses the radiation dose being delivered to tumour and healthy tissues before being also used in pre-targeting radioimmunotherapy.Because TF2 is humanized antibody, it has reduced immunogenicity, opens the road of many imagings or treatment circulation.

 Conclusion 
 It is equally good or be better than IMP 467 with IMP 467 that IMP 485 marks, and has equal stability in serum.But IMP 485 synthesizes much easier than IMP 467.Preliminary study has shown the IMP's 485 of freeze-drying
         18 f mark is same with the peptide of not lyophilized effectively (data do not show).Check the existence of the alkyl or aryl in the joint of rest part chelating moiety being connected to peptide.In joint, the existence of aryl seems to increase radiolabeled yield relative to the existence of alkyl in joint.
       
 In pre-targeting antibody presence or absence situation IMP 485 bio distribution to IMP 467 is observed similar.In the non-existent situation of pre-targeting antibody, in tumour and most of healthy tissues, the low and peptide of the distribution of radiolabeled peptide is by renal excretion removing from circulation.Deposit in case at TF2 antibody, radiolabeled IMP 485 is mainly seen in tumour, is distributed to healthy tissues hardly.Deposit in case at pre-targeting antibody, kidney radio-labeling significantly reduces.We reach a conclusion: IMP 485 and other peptide within a fitting with aryl are suitable for utilizing very much

   gastric pepsin digestion -in the 9.8mg/ml hMN14IgG C/N 0206078 (altogether 882mg) of 90ml, add the 0.1M Citrate trianion of 9.0ml, pH 3.5 damping fluid, pH 3.7 is adjusted to 1M citric acid, add the 0.1M Citrate trianion of 1.2ml, the 1mg/ml stomach en-(pepsic final concentration is 12 Î¼ g/ml) in pH 3.5 damping fluid.Mixture is hatched 40 minutes at 37 DEG C.By SE-HPLC monitoring digestion, and by adding 10%3M Tris, pH 8.6 termination reaction.
       
   purifying -on albumin A post (2.5x8cm, 40mL), carry out purifying.Collection is flow through liquid (flowthrough) (150ml), and it comprises unconjugated F (ab ')
         2 peak.By F (ab ')
         2 filtered by 0.22 Î¼m of strainer.Final concentration is 15mg/ml (33ml, altogether 500mg).Second step comprises
         column chromatography (1x20,16mL).The hMN14F (ab ') of protein concentrate A purifying
         2 , utilize 30K stirring-type ultra-filtration equipment (stir cell) by its diafiltration in 0.02MTris, 0.01M NaCl, pH 8.5.By F (ab ')
         2 be loaded on
         on post.Peak (flow-through peak) is flow through in collection, and merging fraction 3 and 4, concentrates and diafiltration enters 0.04M PBS, pH 7.4.After using 0.22 Î¼m of metre filter, final concentration is 5.5mg/ml, 40mL, altogether 220mg protein.
       
   the preparation of the hMN14Fab ' SH of freeze-drying -carry out TCEP reduction as follows.To the 5.5mg/mL hMN14F (ab ') of 3.8mL
         2 (altogether 20.9mg) adds the 20mM TCEP-HCl be diluted in PBS of 0.38mL.Mixture is at room temperature hatched 2 hours, by SE-HPLC monitoring reaction.Concentrate Fab ' SH and utilize 10K stirring-type ultra-filtration equipment (stir cell) its diafiltration to be entered Formulation Buffer (0.025M NaOAc, 5% trehalose, pH 6.7).Use about 80mL damping fluid.Antibody is filtered by 0.22 Î¼m of strainer.Final concentration is 2.3mg/mL (9mL, altogether 20.7mg).The sulfhydryl content of every antibody is determined as 2.4 SH/Fab by Elman ' s assay method.0.45mL (1mg protein)/bottle is used to carry out freeze-drying.
       
     18     f-marks -hMN-14Fab ' of freeze-drying is dissolved in 100 Î¼ L20mM PBS, in pH7.01.With 20nmol's
         18 f marks NODA-MPAEM.Then by the F-18NODA-MPAEM of 600 Î¼ L (in 1: 1EtOH/H
         2 in O) be added into Fab ' phial, mixture is hatched 10 minutes under RT, then exists
         centrifugal column carries out purifying.The activity (80% yield) of the interpolation of about 80% as the antibody of mark from centrifugal column wash-out.After interpolation CEA, nearly all activity is deflected by SEC, and this shows that mark is relevant to monoclonal antibody ' fragment.
