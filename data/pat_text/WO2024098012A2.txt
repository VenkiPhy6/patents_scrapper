 STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH [0002] Not applicable.  
 INCORPORATION OF SEQUENCE LISTING  
 [0003] A sequence listing contained in the file named “P14008WO00.xml” which is 87,115 bytes in size (measured in MS-Windows), which was created on November 2, 2023, and which comprises 74 polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences, is electronically filed herewith and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.  
 BACKGROUND  
 [0004] Achieving reduced pod dehiscence or reduced pod shatter in the Brassica species currently grown across the globe remains a challenge. Premature pod shatter results in yield loss. In Brassica plants such as oilseed rape, pod shatter-related yield losses can average 20% (Child et al., 1998, J Exp Bot 49: 829-838; and U.S. Patent 8,809,635).  
 [0005] Loss-of-function mutations in an INDEHISCENT (IND) gene which encodes an atypical basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor can provide a reduced pod-shatter phenotype in Arabidopsis (Liljegren et al., 2004, Cell 116, 843-853). Previously disclosed methods to achieve this trait include generation of point mutations in an INDEHISCENT (IND) gene through chemical mutagenesis, reducing expression of an IND gene using RNAi, or other geneediting based techniques for introducing mutations in an IND gene (US Patent Nos. 7,528,294 and 8809635; US Patent Applic. Pub. Nos. US20190053458 and US20220298519; Chopra et al. 2020; Nat Food 1, 84-91; Zhai et al. 2019, Theor Appl Genet 132, 2111-2123). While some of these approaches to reducing IND gene expression resulted in the reduced pod shatter trait, 

undesirable agronomic performance has been observed in plants having complete loss of function (z.e., amorphic) alleles of the IND gene(s). Such undesirable agronomic characteristics of certain pod-shatter resistant Brassica can include reduced threshability (z.e., mechanical separation of the seeds from the pods; U.S. Patent 8,809,635).  
 [0006] There is thus a need for improved alleles of the IND gene or genes of various Brassica sp. including Brassica napus. Brassica carinata, Camelina sativa, and Thlaspi arvense which exhibit reduced pod shatter without also causing undesirable agronomic characteristics.

Thus, the term and/or" as used in a phrase such as "A and/or B" herein is intended to include "A and B," "A or B," "A" (alone), and "B" (alone). Likewise, the term "and/or" as used in a phrase such as "A, B, and/or C" is intended to encompass each of the following embodiments: A, B, and C; A, B, or C; A or C; A or B; B or C; A and C; A and B; B and C; A (alone); B (alone); and C (alone).  
 [0038] As used herein, the term “alleles” refers to alternate forms of a DNA sequence at a genetic locus, that is, a position on a chromosome of a gene or other chromosome marker.  
 [0039] As used herein, the phrase "Brassica plant" refers to a plant in the family Brassicaceae.  
 [0040] As used herein, the terms “correspond,” “corresponding,” and the like, when used in the context of an amino acid position, mutation, and/or substitution in any given IND gene, coding sequence, or protein with respect to the reference IND gene, coding sequence, or protein, all refer to the position, mutation, and/or substitution of the nucleotide or amino acid residue in the given IND sequence that has identity or similarity to the amino acid residue in the reference IND nucleotide or polypeptide sequence when the given IND nucleotide or polypeptide sequence is aligned to the reference IND nucleotide or polypeptide sequence using a pairwise sequence alignment algorithm (e.g, CLUSTAL O 1.2.4 with default parameters).  
 [0041] As used herein, the term “cultivar” refers to a plant that has been cultivated. A cultivar is generally developed using crossing, selfing, and/or selection and is maintained by any suitable method of propagation, through open pollination, selfing, or the like. Details of cultivar development can be found in “Principles of Cultivar Development” by Fehr, Macmillan Publishing Company (1993), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. 

[0042] As used herein, the terms “elite” and “elite line” refer to any line that has resulted from breeding and selection for desirable agronomic performance (typically commercial production). Generally, individuals in a line have similar parentage and one or more similar traits. In some cases, an "elite line" or "elite variety” can be an agronomically superior line or variety that has resulted from many cycles of breeding and selection for superior agronomic performance. An "elite inbred line" is an elite line that is an inbred, and that has been shown to be useful for producing sufficiently high yielding and agronomically fit hybrid varieties (an "elite hybrid variety"). Similarly, "elite germplasm" is a germplasm resulting from breeding and selection for desirable agronomic performance (typically commercial production). Such germplasm may be agronomically superior germplasm, derived from and/or capable of giving rise to a plant with superior agronomic performance, such as an existing or newly developed elite line of a Brassica plant.  
 [0043] As used herein, a “frameshift mutation” refers to a mutation in a nucleic acid sequence that results in the wild-type reading frame being shifted to different reading frame such that translation of an mRNA having a frameshift mutation results in a departure from the wildtype reading frame.  
 [0044] As used herein, the phrase “nonsense mutation” refers to any mutation that results in the appearance of a stop codon where previously there was a codon specifying an amino acid. The presence of this premature stop codon results in the production of a truncated protein. Stop codons include TAA, TAG, and TGA codons.  
 [0045] As used herein, the term “amorphic allele” refers to an allele of a gene having no gene activity in comparison to the wild-type allele of the gene. Amorphic alleles are also known as null or “knock-out” alleles.  
 [0046] As used herein, the term “isomorphic allele” refers to an allele of a gene having wild-type gene activity.  
 [0047] As used herein, the term “hypomorphic allele” refers to an allele of a gene having reduced or partially reduced but not null gene activity in comparison to the wild-type allele of the gene. In embodiments, a hypomorphic allele can exhibit a subset of the phenotypes observed in an amorphic allele. An example of an hypomorphic ind gene allele includes an ind allele which exhibits reduced pod shatter but does not also exhibit undesirable agronomic traits characteristic of amorphic ind alleles.  
 [0048] As used herein, “gene activity” comprises any measure of gene function. Gene activity measures thus include measures of gene-mediated phenotypes e.g., pod shatter resistance and undesirable agronomic traits) and/or gene-encoded protein activity (e.g., transcriptional activation activity). In certain embodiments, transcriptional activation activity can be assayed by 

monitoring expression of genes that are regulated by the gene with transcriptional activation activity.  
 [0049] As used herein, the term “IND” refers to a wild-type INDEHISCENT gene or protein while the term “ind” refers to a mutant INDEHISCENT gene or protein.  
 [0050] As used herein, the terms “include,” “includes,” and “including” are to be construed as at least having the features to which they refer while not excluding any additional unspecified features.  
 [0051] As used herein, the term “plant” includes a whole plant and any descendant, cell, tissue, or part of a plant. The term “plant parts” include any part(s) of a plant, including, for example and without limitation: seed (including mature seed and immature seed); a plant cutting; a plant cell; a plant cell culture; or a plant organ (e.g., pollen, embryos, flowers, fruits, shoots, leaves, roots, stems, and explants). A plant tissue or plant organ may be a seed, protoplast, callus, or any other group of plant cells that is organized into a structural or functional unit. A plant cell or tissue culture may be capable of regenerating a plant having the physiological and morphological characteristics of the plant from which the cell or tissue was obtained, and of regenerating a plant having substantially the same genotype as the plant. Regenerable cells in a plant cell or tissue culture may be embryos, protoplasts, meristematic cells, callus, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, flowers, pods, or stalks. In contrast, some plant cells are not capable of being regenerated to produce plants and are referred to herein as “non-regenerable” plant cells.  
 [0052] As used herein, the term “variety” means a group of similar plants that by structural features, genetic features, and/or performance which can be distinguished from other varieties within the same species. In certain embodiments, the term variety refers to the botanical taxonomic designation whereby variety is ranked below species or subspecies, as well as the legal definition whereby the term “variety” refers to a commercial plant that is protected under the terms outlined in the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.  
 [0053] Where a term is provided in the singular, other embodiments described by the plural of that term are also provided.  
 [0054] To the extent to which any of the preceding definitions is inconsistent with definitions provided in any patent or non-patent reference incorporated herein by reference, any patent or non-patent reference cited herein, or in any patent or non-patent reference found elsewhere, it is understood that the preceding definition will be used herein.  
 [0055] Brassica plants with desirable ind alleles, referred to herein as improved pod shatter resistant (“iPSR”) Brassica, are provided. Also provided are iPSR Brassica plant cells, plant propagules, or plant parts which include seeds are also provided. Such desirable ind alleles, when in the homozygous state, can result in Brassica plants with useful pod shatter resistance traits while 

exhibiting improved agronomic performance in comparison to a control plant homozygous for an amorphic allele of the ind gene. Such improved agronomic performance can include traits such as better threshability. Also provided herein are methods of obtaining iPSR Brassica by breeding, gene editing, and/or mutagenesis. Also provided herein are methods of using the iPSR Brassica including methods of harvesting seed from Brassica crops comprising the iPSR Brassica.  
 [0056] An alignment of IND protein sequences of various Brassica set forth in Figure 4 illustrates extensive conservation of the bHLH domain. Desirable ind alleles provided herein which can confer an improved Pod Shatter Resistance (iPSR) phenotype include ind gene alleles comprising mutations encoding an ind protein where at least 5 or 6 of the amino acid residues located at the C-terminal end of a wild-type Brassica IND protein are deleted and/or substituted with different amino acid residues (e.g., including non-conservative amino acid substitutions). The wild-type IND C-terminal six amino acids comprise the consensus amino acid sequence YHNS(Q/D)(P/S/T) (SEQ ID NO: 32). Examples of the types of mutations (“iPSR mutations” or “iPSR alleles”) which can provide an iPSR Brassica plant include those provided in Table 1 and otherwise described herein. Combinations of such iPSR mutations which include substitutions and deletions of at least the wild-type IND C-terminal five or six amino acids are also contemplated. In certain embodiments, such mutations can be located or introduced at a target Brassica IND gene codon corresponding to the codon of the first N-terminal amino acid of the 18 amino acid C- terminal fragment located immediately C-terminal to the bHLH domain (e.g., the glycine codon in Figure 4) through all following C-terminal amino acid residues to the codon for the tyrosine or histidine residue of the SEQ ID NO: 19 consensus sequence. Brassica plants and the corresponding IND genes which can contain or be made to contain such iPSR mutations include: (i) Brassica napus plants wherein the wild-type IND coding sequence comprises the DNA molecule of SEQ ID NO: 9 or an allelic variant thereof or encodes a protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 19 or an allelic variant thereof; (ii) Brassica carinata plants wherein the wild-type IND coding sequence comprises the DNA molecule of SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, or an allelic variant thereof or encodes a protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, or an allelic variant thereof; (iii) a Camelina sativa plant wherein the wild-type IND coding sequence comprises the DNA molecule of SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, or an allelic variant thereof or encodes a protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, or an allelic variant thereof; and (iv) Thlaspi arvense plants wherein the wild-type IND coding sequence comprises the DNA molecule of SEQ ID NO:2, or an allelic variant thereof or encodes a protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 12 or an allelic variant thereof. In certain embodiments, such iPSR mutations encode an ind protein wherein at least 6 to 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 of the 18 amino acid residues comprising the 

C-terminal consensus sequence of SEQ ID NO: 32 located at the C-terminus of a wild-type IND gene or an allelic variant thereof are deleted and/or are substituted with non-conservative amino acid residues. Brassica plants and the corresponding ind genes which can encode such iPSR mutations include: (i) Brassica napus plants wherein the mutated ind gene encodes a mutant ind protein wherein the final 5 or 6 to 7, 8, 10, or 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of the wild-type IND protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 19 or an allelic variant thereof are deleted and/or substituted (e.g., with a non-conservative amino acid residue) in the mutant ind protein; (ii) Brassica carinata plants wherein the mutated ind gene(s) encode a mutant ind protein wherein the final 5 or 6 to 7, 8, 10, or 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of the wild-type IND protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, and/or an allelic variant thereof are deleted and/or substituted (e.g., with a non-conservative amino acid residue) in the mutant ind protein; (iii) a Camelina sativa plant wherein the mutant ind gene(s) encode a mutant ind protein wherein the final 5 or 6 to 7, 8, 10, or 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of the wild-type IND protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, and/or an allelic variant thereof are deleted and/or substituted e.g., with a non-conservative amino acid residue) in the mutant ind protein; and (iv) Thlaspi arvense plants wherein the mutant ind gene encodes a mutant ind protein wherein the final 5 or 6 to 7, 8, 10, or 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of the wild-type IND protein comprising the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 12 or an allelic variant thereof are deleted and/or substituted (e.g., with a non-conservative amino acid residue) in the mutant ind protein.

 [0064] Methods of obtaining Brassica plants with at least one mutant ind gene which can confer a pod shatter resistance trait by plant breeding methods are also provided herein. In certain embodiments, the methods can comprise crossing a Brassica plant comprising at least one wildtype IND gene with a Brassica plant comprising at least one mutant ind gene containing an iPSR mutation; and (ii) isolating Fl seed and/or Fl progeny plants comprising the mutant ind gene from the cross. Such Fl seed and/or Fl progeny can be identified and isolated by non-destructively assaying for the presence of the ind mutation in a nucleic acid detection assay (e.g., a nucleic acid hybridization-, amplification-, and/or sequencing-based assay for the presence of the iPSR mutation in the IND gene(s)). Non-destructive assays can be accomplished by sampling a portion 

of the Brassica plant or plant part while leaving plant parts necessary for seed production and/or seed viability intact. In certain embodiments, the methods further comprise crossing the isolated Fl progeny plant comprising the mutant ind gene to a recurrent parent Brassica plant comprising a wild-type IND gene and isolating F2 seed and/or F2 progeny comprising the mutant ind gene and one or more genetic markers of the recurrent parent plant. Examples of methods for obtaining new Brassica varieties or elite germplasm containing the iPSR mutations can be achieved by introgressing the iPSR mutation from a first Brassica line into the genetic background of a Brassica varieties or elite germplasm lacking the iPSR trait by using the Brassica varieties or elite germplasm as a recurrent parent in a series of backcrosses, where progeny which contain the iPSR mutation are selected (e.g., by a non-destructive nucleic acid assay) and carried forward into additional crosses to the recurrent parent. When sufficient conversion of the germplasm containing the iPSR mutation is obtained in progeny backcrossed to the recurrent parent (e.g., wherein at least 95%, 98%, or 99% of the linked and unlinked genetic markers to those of the variety or elite germplasm has occurred), the progeny plant containing the iPSR mutation can be selfed to fix the iPSR mutation in the homozygous state and obtain a new Brassica plant variety or elite germplasm exhibiting the iPSR trait. Such linked and unlinked genetic markers which are characteristic of Brassica varieties and elite germplasm can include phenotypic markers: (i) yellow seed (e.g., US Patent Applic. Pub. No. 20190082718, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety); (ii) seed with low fiber content (e.g., US Patent Applic. Pub.

No. 20200131523, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety); (v) an early transition trait; and/or (vi) a lodging trait. Such linked and unlinked genetic markers which are characteristic of Brassica varieties and elite germplasm can include genotypic markers (e.g., genomic DNA sequence polymorphisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), simple sequence repeats (SSR), DNA insertions, DNA deletions, and/or DNA inversions). Markers and associated methods that can be adapted for use in identifying, breeding, and/or introgressing iPSR mutations disclosed herein in various Brassica plants (e.g., Brassica napus, Brassica juncea, Brassica carinata, Brassica rapa (syn. B. campestris), Brassica oleracea, and Brassica nigra) include those disclosed in US Patent Applic. Pub. 20220298519, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The iPSR mutations can be introduced into one or more of the wild-type IND genes by a variety of methods. Methods for introduction of the iPSR mutations include, but are not limited to, traditional mutagenesis (e.g., Ethyl Methane Sulfonate (EMS), fast neutrons (FN), or gamma rays), and TILLING. In certain embodiments, the iPSR mutation results from introduction of a DSB at a target site in the IND gene (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or an allelic variant thereof in the region encoding the 18 amino acid residues located C-terminal to the conserved basic Helix-Loop Helix (bHLH) domain of the IND gene as shown in Figure 3) to induce non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at the site of the break followed by recovery of desired iPSR mutants. In certain embodiments, the iPSR mutation results from introduction of a DSB at a target site in the IND gene (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or an allelic variant thereof in the region encoding the 18 amino acid residues located C-terminal to the conserved basic Helix-Loop Helix (bHLH) domain of the IND gene as shown in Figure 3) followed by homology-directed repair (HDR), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), or NHEJ to introduce a desired donor DNA template polynucleotide at the DSB, followed by recovery of the iPSR mutation. Methods for introduction of the DSB and iPSR mutations also include use of gene editing reagents which can comprise meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activatorlike effector nucleases (TALENS), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated Cas nuclease (e.g., Cas9, Casl2a, Cmsl, S. aureus Cas9 variants, a Cas9, a nCas9 nickase, a type V Cas nuclease, a Casl2a nuclease, a nCasl2a nickase, a Casl2d (CasY), a Casl2e (CasX), a Casl2b (C2cl), a Casl2c (C2c3), a Casl2i, a Casl2f, a Casl2j, a Casl4, or eSpCas9 nuclease) in combination with guide RNAs, and the like.

also be adapted for introduction of the iPSR mutations disclosed herein. The particular Cas endonuclease selected can be used to identify the location of suitable PAM sites and design of crRNAs or sgRNAs. G-rich PAM sites, e.g., 5’-NGG are used for guide RNAs (e.g., crRNAs or sgRNAs) used with Cas9 proteins.

T-rich PAM sites (e.g., 5’-TTN or 5’-TTTV, where "V" is A, C, or G) are typically targeted for design of crRNAs or sgRNAs used with Casl2a proteins. In some instances, Casl2a can also recognize a 5’-CTA PAM motif. Other examples of potential Cas 12a PAM sequences include TTN, CTN, TCN, CCN, TTTN, TCTN, TTCN, CTTN, ATTN, TCCN, TTGN, GTTN, CCCN, CCTN, TTAN, TCGN, CTCN, ACTN, GCTN, TCAN, GCCN, and CCGN (wherein N is defined as any nucleotide).

Such CBE and ABE systems can be adapted for use in making iPSR mutations including nonsense mutations which introduce a premature “stop” codon in the in the region encoding the 18 amino acid residues located C-terminal to the conserved basic Helix- Loop Helix (bHLH) domain of the IND gene. Examples of ABE and CBE systems which can be adapted for use in making iPSR mutations disclosed herein include those disclosed in Nat Biotechnol 39, 917 (2021). doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01015-l, and in US20170121693, US20210130805, and WO2020214842, which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

EXAMPLES  
 Example 1. Identification of Underlying Gene Mutations in a T. arvense Reduced Shatter Line  
 [00115] Genomic DNA was extracted from the candidate T. arvense reduced shatter line designated 2032 (T. arvense cultivar 2032, deposited as deposited under NCMA Accession Number 202210002) using column-based plant DNA mini -prep protocols, and whole-genome resequencing was performed with 2x150 bp read technology on Illumina platform. Sequence reads were mapped to the MN106-Reference genome (Nunn et al. Plant Biotechnol J., 2022, doi: 10.1111/pbi.13775) using bwa alignment and SNPs were identified using GATK HaplotypeCaller. SNPs were analyzed using genome annotations to assess the change in amino acid sites with the presence of nucleotide changes within the coding regions. The nucleotide substitution at position C531 A (relative to the wild-type T. arvense INDI gene of SEQ ID NO: 2) resulting in premature stop codon at Y177* (relative to the wild-type T. arvense INDI protein of SEQ ID NO: 12) was identified in the INDEHISCENT1 gene of T. arvense cultivar 2032. This premature stop codon results in the expression of an indl protein which lacks the 6 C-terminal amino acids of the wild-type INDI protein. The indl allele with the C531 A nucleotide substitution is referred to as indl-4, comprises SEQ ID NO: 73, and encodes the indl-4 protein of SEQ ID NO: 74. To determine the conservative nature of the mutation sites across species, T. arvense peptide sequences were aligned with the peptide sequences of other Brassica species (Figure 4). The DNA and amino acid sequence alignments highlight the conserved regions of the IND genes. [00116] Allele-specific markers were designed to genotype plants containing the C531 A mutation identified from whole-genome resequencing data and genotyping was performed on the DNA extracted using quick-extract protocol from LGC genomics. PCR reactions were carried out ThermoFisher QuantStudio 6.0 using the recommended protocols. Co-segregation analysis was performed in the greenhouse grown 54 F2 plants derived from cross between a line carrying the reduced shatter marker and a line carrying the normal shatter trait. Greenhouse observations were made for presence and absence of the reduced shatter trait. It was found that the plants carrying the C531 A indl mutation in the homozygous state (“homozyg.”) had this reduced shatter trait in the greenhouse conditions.  
 [00117] Table 2. Summary of Greenhouse Experiments 
 
 
 
 
 
 [00118] Based on observations in the greenhouse it was found that plants with wild-type INDI allele had no reduced shatter phenotype, whereas 64.7% of the plants classified as having the C531A indl mutation (indl-4; SEQ ID NO: 73) in the homozygous state exhibited a reduced shatter phenotype. Penetrance of the trait could have been influenced by the greenhouse conditions. Also, the method used to assess shattering for this experiment was a qualitative approach. Shattering resistance was not, for example, quantified using a force meter.  
 [00119] Table 3. Summary of Phenotypes in Greenhouse observations 
 
 

[00120] To further confirm the trait and genotype interaction, the cultivars derived from T. arvense cultivar 2032 were planted in replicated trials at Mt. Pulaski, IL, USA (MPI) and Havana, IL, USA (HVI) in the fall of 2021. These cultivars were evaluated for shattering at harvest on a scale of 0 to 100 percent. Phenotypic measurements are collected just prior to harvest when plants are fully mature. Percent shatter is based on the estimation of pods lost to natural dehiscence. DNA was extracted using column based mini-prep methods and genotyping was performed on the seedlings of these 29 cultivars using the allele-specific marker designed to target the indl gene mutation discussed above. Phenotypic data and genotypic data associated with these lines is described below and in Figures 1 and 2. Co-segregation analysis with the trait was significantly associated with the reduced shatter measurement observed in the field conditions.  
 [00121] Table 4. Field observations of 29 cultivars derived from T. arvense cultivar 2032 parent carrying reduced shatter mutation in indl gene. Shatter rating columns represent the percent of pods dehisced after harvest maturity in field conditions at Mt. Pulaski (MPI) and Havana, Illinois (HVI). 
 
 
 
 [00122] Table 5. Comparison of T. arvense cultivar 2032 with the 182002-B-B-31 line obtained from T. arvense cultivar 2032 
 
 
 [00123] Table 5 shows that the 182002-B-B-31 line obtained from a cross between T. arvense cultivar 2032 and a second unrelated parent retains the reduced shattering trait of T. arvense cultivar 2032 but lacks the increased lodging and decreased yield traits of T. arvense cultivar 2032.  
 Example 2. Identification of Protospacer regions for guide RNAs directed to Brassica IND genes  
 [00124] Protospacer coding sequences described below in Table 5 can be targeted in three Brassica plants (Ta - Thlaspi arvense, At - Arabidopsis thaliana; Cs - Camelina sativa. 

Ta_At_Cs_PS_2) can also be targeted for many of the Brassica plants such as Brassica napus, Camelina sativa, and Brassica carinata. Suitable gRNAs can be designed based on the Cas9 nuclease and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) - ‘NGG’ present in the target Brassica plant IND gene sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).  
 [00125] Protospacers can be designed to target the different region of IND gene including iPSR mutations in pennycress, Arabidopsis and Camelina using the webtool “CHOPCHOP” (on the https internet site chopchop.cbu.uib.no/; Labun et al. Nucleic Acids Research (2019) doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz365) and “CRISPOR” (on the http internet site crispor.tefor.net/;  
 Concordet and Haeussler. Nucleic Acids Research (2018) doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky354). These protospacers can be assembled for use with a Cas9 system. To generate mutations in these Brassicas, CRISPR/SpCas9 DNA constructs designed to target regions of the IND genes will be delivered using a disarmed Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain (GV3101) and a standard floral dip or other transformation method. Presence of the edits in the IND genes of T1 plants will confirmed through PCR or fluorescent marker screening. Seed from the progeny T2 generation will be screened for lines with IND gene edits that lack the transgene using PCR and sanger sequencing.

 Example 3. Generation of Pennycress, Arabidopsis, and Camelina plants with Mutant ind Genes by Gene Editing  
 [00127] Protospacer designing and construct preparation  
 [00128] Validated INDI gene sequences from Penny cress, Arabidopsis, and Camelina were used to design protospacers unique and common to the INDI loci in all three plant species. Editing efficiency and frameshift efficiency along with other parameters were compared using two webbased protospacer design software’s CHOPCHOP and Cas-Designer (Park et al. Bioinformatics 31 (24): 4014-4016 (2015), doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv537. Off-targeting potential was evaluated using BlastN similarity search program against the respective genomes. 

[00129] The designed protospacers were cloned in a binary Agrobacterium plant transformation vector between Aarl restriction sites using Golden Gate assembly. The expression of the guide RNA containing the protospacer was driven by Arabidopsis U6 promoter whereas expression of Cas9 nuclease and the scorable marker DsRED2 were driven by an Arabidopsis 
 RPS5a and a Cassava mosaic virus promoter, respectively.  
 [00130] Table 7 
 
 
 [00131] Agrobacterium transformation and floral dip  
 [00132] Sanger sequencing verified constructs (pARV55, pARV56, pARV58, pARV59, pARV72 and pARV73) were electroporated into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 strain and selected on Rifampicin, Gentamycin and construct specific Kanamycin antibiotics. Agrobacterium culture (OD 1.0-1.2) from positively screened single agrobacterium colony was used to transform the Pennycress, Arabidopsis and Camelina plants using a floral dip method. Pennycress and Camelina flowers were dipped in a suspension of the Agrobacterium for 5-8 min under a 27-28 mmHg vacuum in order to maximize the number of transformation events whereas Arabidopsis flowers were dipped in a suspension of the Agrobacterium without vacuum. Once matured, the T1 seeds were screened under red light system to identify the DsRED2 expressing transformants. T1 plants were grown from the DsRED2 expressing transformants and T2 seeds were harvested for further genotyping.  
 [00133] Screening for edited plants  
 [00134] Plants from independent T2 lines of Penny cress, Arabidopsis, and Camelina were genotyped for Cas9 nuclease-mediated editing. In brief, PCR product was amplified using target site flanking primer pairs and Sanger sequencing. The resulting sequences were aligned against the wildtype INDI sequence to identify the plants with insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions (InDeis). 

[00135] Reduced pod shatter phenotyping  
 [00136] A gram force tension gauge (SSEYL ATG-100-2 Tension Gauge) attached to a two-inch alligator clip was used to determine the force required to break apart seedpods at the septum. One side of a pennycress pod was clipped, and the other side was pulled manually until the pod breaks apart. For each line, 5 pods each from five different plants were used for the measurements.  
 [00137] In Arabidopsis, 5 siliques from each plant were manually detached and kept in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Tubes with pods from Col-0 and edited T2 plants were simultaneously vortexed for 10 seconds and scored based on number and extant of pods shattered. The experiment was replicated by 5 independent people to reduce handling bias.  
 [00138] Partially mature pods were observed under the microscope to understand the separation layer formation in the edited plants. In brief, free-hand sections were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue O and washed thrice with MilliQ™ water before transferred to a microscope slide for observation under a compound microscope using the 20x objective.  
 [00139] Screening for edited plants in pennycress  
 [00140] Several protospacers were designed to target 5’ to 3’ region of INDI gene in pennycress, Arabidopsis, and Camelina and subsequently cloned to generate constructs pARV55, pARV56, pARV58, pARV59, pARV72 and pARV73. Pennycress was transformed with 4 constructs (pARV55, pARV56, pARV58, pARV59) whereas Arabidopsis and Camelina were transformed with 3 constructs (pARV56, pARV72 and pARV73). The TDNA-free T2 plants from each positive line were further screened for the presence or absence of editing in the INDI gene(s). [00141] In penny cress, PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the INDI locus from pARV55 derived T2 plants resulted into identification of 3 different insertion events after the 517th nucleotide (+A, +G and +T in gene edited lines B56924A1 (SEQ ID NO: 43), B56914A5 (SEQ ID NO: 34), and B56930A5 (SEQ ID NO: 35), respectively) whereas pARV56 derived T2 plants resulted in +A, +C and +T insertion events after the 524th nucleotide of the INDI gene in gene edited lines B56929A1, B56922A5 and B56941 Al, respectively (Figure 1 IB). Interestingly, insertion in two of the edited plants namely B56924A1 (+A insertion after 517th nucleotide) and B56929A1 (+A insertion after 524th nucleotide) resulted into early stop codon immediately after the conserved domain and resultant protein was like the Ta_indl-4 allele (Figure 12). When we additionally created edits in the non-iPSR regions of the INDI gene which targeted the 5’ coding region of the gene and the bHLH domain, we were unable to break the seed pods using the methods described here and threshability of the seed pods was significantly reduced in comparison to the edits in the iPSR regions of the INDI gene.  
 [00142] Screening for edited plants in Arabidopsis 

[00143] In Arabidopsis, screening of pARV56- derived T2 plants resulted in identification of 2 insertion events after the 572nd nucleotide (+A in At indl Pl and +T in At_indl_P2) and one deletion event after 560th nucleotide (-34 in At indl Pl) (Figure 18B). The +A insertion in At indl Pl and -34 bases deletion in At_indl_P3 resulted in early stop codon after conserved domain whereas +T insertion in At_indl_P2 resulted in frameshift with one amino acid extended protein (Figure 19). Similar to penny cress, we created additional edits in the non-iPSR regions of the Arabidopsis INDI gene (Figure 23).  
 [00144] Screening for edited plants in Camelina  
 [00145] In Camelina, screening of pARV56- derived T2 plants resulted in identification of several T2 plants with each of 3 homeologs having different combination of edits. In T2 plant C10012D7, gene on Chr8 and Chrl3 were found to have +A insertion after 476th and 479th nucleotide, respectively whereas edit on Chr2 homologue was detected to be biallelic in nature (+A after 476th nucleotide and other edits). Similarly, In T2 plant C10012D10, the IND gene on Chr8 and Chrl3 were found to have +T insertion (after 476th nucleotide) and +A insertion (after 479th nucleotide), respectively whereas the edit on Chr2 IND homologue was again detected to be biallelic in nature (+A and +T after 476th nucleotide and other edits).  
 [00146] Reduced pod shatter phenotyping in pennycress  
 [00147] Multiple pods from each edited T2 plants were phenotype for difference in force needed to break open the pod using a gram force tension gauge attached to a two-inch alligator clip. Upon applying the force, the seedpods of all the edited alleles required more force to break open than the wild type seed pods (Fig. 17 A. However, the force required to break open the seedpods of both the alleles with +A insertion (B56924A1 and B56929A1) was approximately 3 times more wild type (Fig. 17A). Other alleles in this region showed a stronger reduction in shatter. Alleles with edits in the iPSR regions showed significantly reduced pod breakage and strongly supports the causation of the observed reduced pod shatter phenotype by these mutations. For 5’ edits or the bHLH domain edits in the non-iPSR regions of the INDI gene which created nonsense or frameshift mutations, we were unable to collect any measurements because the seed pods harvested from these edited plants were too difficult to separate using the above methods to separate pods of the iPSR mutants or even with manual threshing.  
 [00148] Reduced pod shatter phenotyping in Arabidopsis  
 [00149] The size and shape of the Arabidopsis siliques makes it difficult to use the gram force tension gauge, so the vortexing method described above was used. The manual shattering observations performed by 5 different individuals clearly showed the lesser number of open siliques in the At indl Pl allele with +A insertion compared to wild type siliques (Figure 10C). Upon applying the external force, only 20% of At_indl_Pl siliques were shattered whereas 60% 

siliques break open in the wild type (Figure IOC) which clearly indicates towards the reduce pod shatter phenotype acquired upon the +A insertion in edited alleles. We expect similar results when edited in this iPSR region of the Arabidopsis.  
 [00150] Toluidine blue O staining assay  
 [00151] The phenotype observed in the pennycress pods and Arabidopsis siliques were clearly supported by the 0.05% toluidine blue O staining assay. In pennycress, 2032-WG with the indl-4 allele (SEQ ID NO: 73 and 74) retains the separation layer but is less well-defined than the B28:WG wildtype control (Fig. 17B) while B56929A1 with +A allele (SEQ ID NO: 36 and 46) retains the separation layer but is darker than the wildtype (Figure 17B). More blue color (dark in greyscale Fig. 17B) in the dehiscence zone indicates the presence of more separation layer. Similarly, in the Arabidopsis, staining of At indl Pl allele retained darker blue stain than wild type Col-0 siliques (Figure 24C). The toluidine blue O staining results clearly supported the reduced pod shatter phenotype observed in both pennycress and Arabidopsis seed pods.  
 [00152] Characterization of Camelina with indl gene edits  
 [00153] Cas9-mediated INDI gene editing results achieved with the pARV56 vector driving expression of the guide RNA comprising the PS2 protospacer are shown in Figures 25A, B, C, Figure 26, and in Table 8.  
 [00154] Table 8. Camelina T2 gene edited plants generated with the pARV56 construct 
 
 
 [00155] Camelina plants comprising the mutations in one, two, and/or all three of the Camelina INDI genes located on chromosomes 2, 8, and 13 will be crossed and/or selfed to obtain progeny plants homozygous for the indl mutations shown in in Figures Figure 25, Figure 26, and in Table 8. More specifically, Camelina plants comprising the following IND gene edits C10012D7_Cs_Chr2(+A) (encoding the SEQ ID NO: 68 protein), C10012D7_Cs_Chr8(+A) (encoding the SEQ ID NO: 69 protein), C10012D7_Cs_Chrl3(+A) (encoding the SEQ ID NO: 70 protein), C10012D10_Cs_Chr2(+T) (encoding the SEQ ID NO: 71 protein), C10012D10_Cs_Chr2(+A) (encoding the SEQ ID NO: 68 protein), C10012D10_Cs_Chr8(+T) 

(encoding the SEQ ID NO: 72 protein), and/or C10012D10_Cs_Chrl3(+A) (SEQ ID NO: 70) will be crossed and/or selfed to obtain progeny Camelina plants homozygous for at least one, at least two, or all three of the IND gene edits on chromosome 2 (Chr2), chromosome 8 (Chr8) and chromosome 13 (Chrl3). It is anticipated that at least some of the progeny Camelina plants homozygous for at least one, at least two, or all three of the IND gene edits on chromosome 2 (Chr2), chromosome 8 (Chr8) and chromosome 13 (Chrl3) will exhibit improved pod shatter resistance in comparison to wild-type Camelina plants lacking IND mutants. It is also anticipated that at least some of the progeny Camelina plants homozygous for at least one, at least two, or all three of the IND gene edits on chromosome 2 (Chr2), chromosome 8 (Chr8) and chromosome 13 (Chrl3) will exhibit improved threshability in comparison to control Camelina plants homozygous for amorphic (null) alleles of at least one, at least two, or all three of the IND genes on chromosome 2 (Chr2), chromosome 8 (Chr8) and chromosome 13 (Chrl3).
