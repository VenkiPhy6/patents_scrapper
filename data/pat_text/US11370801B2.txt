 The present invention relates to conjugates comprising pyrrolobenzodiazepines and related dimers (PBDs), and the precursor drug linkers used to make such conjugates. 
 BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION 
 Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al.,  Chem. Rev.  1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al.,  Chem. Brit.,  26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al.,  Tetrahedron,  48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al,  J. Antibiotics,  29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston,  J. Org. Chem.,  52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure: 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N═C), a carbinolamine (NH—CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH—CH(OMe))ram at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In  Antibiotics III . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter,  Acc. Chem. Res.,  19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents. 
 It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of this molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8/C′-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al.,  J. Org. Chem.,  61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5′-Pu-GATC-Py-3′ interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al.,  Biochemistry,  42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al.,  Biochemistry,  44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity. 
 The first dimers (Bose, D. S., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  114, 4939-4941 (1992)) were of the general formula: 
                     
where n is from 3 to 6. The compounds where n were 3 and 5 showed promising cytoxicity in vitro. However when antitumor activity of the the n=3 compound (DSB-120) was studied (Walton, M., et al.,  Cancer Chemother Pharmacol  (1996) 38: 431. doi:10.1007/s002800050507), this was found not to be as promising. This lack of promise was thought to be “a consequence of low tumour selectivity and drug uptake as a result of high protein binding and/or extensive drug metabolism in vivo”.
 
 In order to improve on these compounds, compounds were investigated (Gregson, S. J., et al., Chem. Commun., 1999, 797-798. doi: 10.1039/A809791G) with the “inclusion of C2/C2′ substituents that should follow the contour of the host minor groove”. This compound SG2000 (SJG-136): 
                     
was found to have “exquisite cytotoxicity in the picomolar region . . . some 9000-fold more potent that DSB-120.”
 
 This compound (also discussed in Gregson, S., et al.,  J. Med. Chem.,  44, 737-748 (2001); Alley, M. C., et al.,  Cancer Research,  64, 6700-6706 (2004); and Hartley, J. A., et al.,  Cancer Research,  64, 6693-6699 (2004)) has been involved in clinical trials as a standalone agent, for example, NCT02034227 investigating its use in treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (see: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02034227). 
 Dimeric PBD compounds bearing C2 aryl substituents alongside endo-unsaturation, such as SG2202 (ZC-207), are disclosed in WO 2005/085251: 
                     
and in WO2006/111759, bisulphites of such PBD compounds, for example SG2285 (ZC-423):
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 These compounds have been shown to be highly useful cytotoxic agents (Howard, P. W., et al.,  Bioorg. Med. Chem . (2009), doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.09.012). 
 In a review of PBD containing ADCs (Mantaj, J., et al.,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed . (2016), 55, 2-29; DOI: 10.1002/anie.201510610), the SAR of PBD dimers is discussed. The summary of the SAR is presented in FIG. 3-B “C2-exo and C1-C2/C2-C3 unsaturation enhances activity”. A more detailed discussion is found at section 2.4 which says: 
 “DSB-120 has poor activity in vivo, attributed partly to its high reactivity with cellular thiol-containing molecules such as glutathione. However, introduction of C2/C2′-exo unsaturation as in SJG-136 led to an overall increase in DNA-binding affinity and cytotoxicity, and a lower reactivity toward cellular nucleophiles with more of the agent potentially reaching its target DNA.” 
 WO 2007/085930 describes the preparation of dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody. The linker is present in the bridge linking the monomer PBD units of the dimer. 
 Dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody, are described in WO 2011/130598. The linker in these compounds is attached to one of the available N10 positions, and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group. The dimer PBD compounds have either endo or exo unsaturation in the C-ring. 
 WO 2014/057074 and WO 2015/052322 describes specific PBD dimer conjugates bound via the N10 position on one monomer, and all these compounds have endo unsaturation in the C-ring. 
 WO2014/096365 discloses the compound: 
                     
where the lack of unsaturation in the C-ring is coupled with the B-ring being a dilactam and therefore not having the ability to covalently bind DNA.

Ligand Unit
 
 The Ligand Unit may be of any kind, and include a protein, polypeptide, peptide and a non-peptidic agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a cyclic polypeptide. These Ligand units can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one target molecule-binding site, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, or any other cell binding molecule or substance that can specifically bind to a target. 
 The terms “specifically binds” and “specific binding” refer to the binding of an antibody or other protein, polypeptide or peptide to a predetermined molecule (e.g., an antigen). Typically, the antibody or other molecule binds with an affinity of at least about 1×10 7  M −1 , and binds to the predetermined molecule with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific molecule (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined molecule or a closely-related molecule. 
 Examples of Ligand units include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein. 
 In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a Cell Binding Agent that binds to an extracellular target on a cell. Such a Cell Binding Agent can be a protein, polypeptide, peptide or a non-peptidic agent. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a cyclic polypeptide. The Cell Binding Agent also may be antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). 
 Cell Binding Agent 
 A cell binding agent may be of any kind, and include peptides and non-peptides. These can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one binding site, lymphokines, hormones, hormone mimetics, vitamins, growth factors, nutrient-transport molecules, or any other cell binding molecule or substance. 
 Peptides 
 In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4-30, preferably 6-20, contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment, it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound. 
 In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin a v β 6 . The peptide may be selective for α v β 6  over XYS. 
 In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV-Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV-Cys has the sequence: NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC. Alternatively, a variant of the A20FMDV-Cys sequence may be used wherein one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten amino acid residues are substituted with another amino acid residue. Furthermore, the polypeptide may have the sequence NAVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXRTC. 
 Antibodies 
 The term “antibody” herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003)  Jour. of Immunology  170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001)  Immuno Biology,  5 th Ed ., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin. 
 “Antibody fragments” comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′) 2 , and scFv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. 
 The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975)  Nature  256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system (Lonberg (2008) Curr. Opinion 20(4):450-459). 
 The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984)  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include “primatized” antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences. 
 An “intact antibody” herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more “effector functions” which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR. 
 Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different “classes.” There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into “subclasses” (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called a, b, E, y, and p, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. 
 Humanisation 
 Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non-human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed “humanisation”. 
 A “humanized antibody” refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region, preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain, has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein, preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression “humanized antibodies” includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region (“CDR”) amino acid residues and/or one or more framework region (“FW” or “FR”) amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non-human antibodies. The expression “humanized antibody” also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin. 
 “Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Or, looked at another way, a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non-natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and/or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulins. 
 There are a range of humanisation techniques, including ‘CDR grafting’, ‘guided selection’, ‘deimmunization’, ‘resurfacing’ (also known as ‘veneering’), ‘composite antibodies’, ‘Human String Content Optimisation’ and framework shuffling. 
 CDR Grafting 
 In this technique, the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, camel, bovine, goat, or rabbit having the desired properties (in effect, the non-human CDRs are ‘grafted’ onto the human framework). In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues (this may happen when, for example, a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding). 
 Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus, in general, a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one, and in one aspect two, variable domains, in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), or that of a human immunoglobulin. 
 Guided Selection 
 The method consists of combining the V H  or V L  domain of a given non-human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human V H  or V L  library and specific human V domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VH×VL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology (N.Y.) 12, (1994) 899-903. 
 Composite Antibodies 
 In this method, two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required, T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by, exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008/0206239 A1. 
 Deimmunization 
 This method involves the removal of human (or other second species) T-cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody (or other molecule). The therapeutic antibodies V-region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II-binding motifs by, for example, comparison with databases of MHC-binding motifs (such as the “motifs” database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au). Alternatively, MHC class II-binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 249 244-250 (1995)); in these methods, consecutive overlapping peptides from the V-region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides, such as amphipathicity, Rothbard motifs, and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes. 
 Once potential second species (e.g. human) T-cell epitopes have been identified, they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T-cell epitope itself, but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein (and therefore, may not be adjacent in the primary structure). Most typically, the alteration is by way of substitution but, in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate. 
 All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology, so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However, the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible. 
 Resurfacing 
 This method involves:
         (a) determining the conformational structure of the variable region of the non-human (e.g. rodent) antibody (or fragment thereof) by constructing a three-dimensional model of the non-human antibody variable region;   (b) generating sequence alignments using relative accessibility distributions from x-ray crystallographic structures of a sufficient number of non-human and human antibody variable region heavy and light chains to give a set of heavy and light chain framework positions wherein the alignment positions are identical in 98% of the sufficient number of non-human antibody heavy and light chains;   (c) defining for the non-human antibody to be humanized, a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues using the set of framework positions generated in step (b);   (d) identifying from human antibody amino acid sequences a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues that is most closely identical to the set of surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c), wherein the heavy and light chain from the human antibody are or are not naturally paired;   (e) substituting, in the amino acid sequence of the non-human antibody to be humanized, the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c) with the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues identified in step (d);   (f) constructing a three-dimensional model of the variable region of the non-human antibody resulting from the substituting specified in step (e);   (g) identifying, by comparing the three-dimensional models constructed in steps (a) and (f), any amino acid residues from the sets identified in steps (c) or (d), that are within 5 Angstroms of any atom of any residue of the complementarity determining regions of the non-human antibody to be humanized; and   (h) changing any residues identified in step (g) from the human to the original non-human amino acid residue to thereby define a non-human antibody humanizing set of surface exposed amino acid residues; with the proviso that step (a) need not be conducted first, but must be conducted prior to step (g).
 
Superhumanization
       
 The method compares the non-human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non-human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally, the non-human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005/079479 A2. 
 Human String Content Optimization 
 This method compares the non-human (e.g. mouse) sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content (HSC) that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC/T-cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants (described in Molecular Immunology, 44, (2007) 1986-1998). 
 Framework Shuffling 
 The CDRs of the non-human antibody are fused in-frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in  Methods  36, 43-60 (2005). 
 Examples of cell binding agents include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein.

 The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) sequence (Dennis et al. (2002) “Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins”  J Biol Chem.  277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746). Antibodies of the invention include fusion proteins with ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002)  J Biol Chem.  277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; (ii) US 2004/0001827 at [0076]; and (iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, and all of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 In one embodiment, the antibody has been raised to target specific the tumour related antigen α v β 6 . 
 The cell binding agent may be labelled, for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate, or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope. 
 Connection of Linker Unit to Ligand Unit 
 The Ligand unit is connected to the Linker unit through a disulfide bond. 
 In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Drug Linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the Ligand unit and a maleimide group of the Drug Linker unit. 
 The cysteine residues of the Ligand unit may be available for reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit to form a connection. In other embodiments, for example where the Ligand unit is an antibody, the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit. 
 In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is an introduced into the heavy or light chain of an antibody. Positions for cysteine insertion by substitution in antibody heavy or light chains include those described in Published U.S. Application No. 2007-0092940 and International Patent Publication WO2008070593, which are incorporated herein. 
 Methods of Treatment 
 The compounds of the present invention may be used in a method of therapy. Also provided is a method of treatment, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a conjugate of formula II. The term “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors. 
 A conjugate may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g. drugs; surgery; and radiation therapy. 
 Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, i.e. a conjugate of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous. 
 Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included. A capsule may comprise a solid carrier such a gelatin. 
 For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be included, as required.

 Drug Loading 
 The drug loading (p) is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent, e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines, drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines, drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, although an upper limit of 40, 20, 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 80, 1 to 40, 1 to 20, 1 to 10 or 1 to 8. 
 The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV, reverse phase HPLC, HIC, mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates. 
 For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. 
 Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the Drug Linker. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of Drug Linker relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification. 
 Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by engineering one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids. 
 Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) Blood 114(13):2721-2729; U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,521,541; 7,723,485; WO2009/052249). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC. 
 Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody. 
 Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues. 
 In one embodiment, the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8, 2 to 8, 2 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8. 
 In some embodiments, there is one dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine group per cell binding agent. 
 General Synthetic Routes 
 The synthesis of PBD compounds is extensively discussed in the following references, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference:
     a) WO 00/12508 (pages 14 to 30);   b) WO 2005/023814 (pages 3 to 10);   c) WO 2004/043963 (pages 28 to 29); and   d) WO 2005/085251 (pages 30 to 39).
 
Synthesis Route
   
 Compounds of the present invention of formula I where R 20  and R 21  form a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound can be synthesised from a compound of Formula II: 
                     
where R 6 , R 7 , R 9 , R 6′ , R 7′ , R 9′ , R 11b , Y, Y′ and R″ are as defined for compounds of formula I, and R LL  is a precursor of R L —this method is particularly applicable to compounds of formula I where R L  is of formula IIIa. For these compounds, R LL  will typically be a portion of R L , such as a group of formula IIIa′:
 
                     
In such as case, the reaction involves adding the group G L . The second required step is removal of the Prot O  group.
 
 The compounds of Formula 2 may be made by deprotecting the R LL  group of compounds of Formula 3: 
                     
where R 6 , R 7 , R 9 , R 6′ , R 7′ , R 9′ , R 11b , Y, Y′ and R″ are as defined for compounds of formula I, R LL-Prot  is a protected version of R LL , and the Prot N  represents a simple nitrogen protecting group (e.g. Fmoc, Boc) that is orthogonal to the R LL  protecting group.
 
 Compounds of formula 3 may be made by ring-closure of compounds of Formula 4: 
                     
where the ring closure is carried out by oxidation, e.g. Swern.
 
 Compounds of formula 4 can be synthesised from compounds of formula 5: 
                     
by a step-wise addition of two protecting groups. This can be achieved by simple protection of the amino group which will result in the imino bond in the final compound (e.g. by Fmoc, Boc), followed by installation of a desired protecting group at the other amino group.
 
 Compounds of formula I where R L  is of formula IIIb, may be synthesised in a similar manner, although the complete R L  group may be installed starting from a compound of Formula 5, rather than with the use of a protected precursor. 
 Compounds of Formula 5 can be synthesised by known methods, such as those disclosed in WO 2011/130598. 
 Alternatively, compounds of Formula 4 can be synthesised by a monomeric route, as shown in example 3. 
 Compounds of the present invention of formula I where R 20  and R 21  do not form a nitrogen-carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound can by made by modifications to the above routes. 
 Synthesis of Drug Conjugates 
 Conjugates can be prepared as previously described. Antibodies can be conjugated to the Drug Linker compound as described in Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2003, 21, 778-784). Briefly, antibodies (4-5 mg/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37° C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, is monitored by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols/mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0° C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol. After 1 hour, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC is then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation, and RP-HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker.

 A 50 mM solution of Dithiothreitol (DTT) in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) was added (100 molar equivalent/antibody, 6.7 micromoles, 0.13 mL at 50 mM) to a 5 mL solution of antibody (10 mg, 67 nanomoles) in reduction buffer containing PBS and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and a final antibody concentration of 2.0 mg/mL. The resultant mixture was incubated at +25° C. for overnight (or until full reduction observed by UHPLC) in an orbital shaker with gentle (60 rpm) shaking. After cooling down to room temperature, the reduced antibody was buffer exchanged, via spin filter using 50 KDa MWCO vivaspin, into conjugation buffer containing PBS pH 7.4 and 1 mM EDTA to remove all the excess reducing agent. Compound 1 was added as a DMSO solution (20 molar equivalent/antibody, 1.34 micromoles, in 0.4 mL DMSO) to 4.0 mL of this reduced antibody solution (10 mg, 67 nanomoles) for a 10% (v/v) final DMSO concentration. The solution was shaken for 1 hour at +25° C. and then conjugation was quenched with excess N-acetyl cysteine (6.7 micromoles, 67 μL at 100 mM). 
 Resultant ADC was purified via preparative size exclusion column (GE Sephadex 26/60) fitted to an AKTA Start instrument using PBS, pH 7.4 buffer. Fractions were collected and analysed for the monomeric content using Shimadzu Prominence system using a Tosoh Bioscience TSKgel SuperSW mAb HTP 4 μm 4.6×150 mm column (with a 4 μm 3.0×20 mm guard column) eluting with 0.3 mL/minute sterile-filtered SEC buffer containing 200 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.95, 250 mM potassium chloride and 10% isopropanol (v/v) at 280 nm. Fractions with monomer content >92% were pooled and then concentrated using 50 kDa MWCO vivaspin into buffer containing PBS pH 7.4. Extent of free drug removal was monitored by UHPLC-RP using neat conjugate and after complete removal of free drug, ADC was filtered using 0.22 μm, Mustang filter under sterile atmosphere and then stored at +4° C.

 Example 7—In Vitro Testing 
 MTS Cytotoxicity Method 
 The concentration and viability of cells from a sub-confluent (80-90% confluency) T75 flask are measured by trypan blue staining, and counted using the LUNA-II™ Automated Cell Counter. Cells were diluted to 2×10 5 /ml, dispensed (50 μl per well) into 96-well flat-bottom plates. 
 A stock solution (1 ml) of the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) to be tested (20 μg/ml) was made by dilution of filter-sterilised ADC into cell culture medium. A set of 8×10-fold dilutions of stock ADC were made in a 24-well plate by serial transfer of 100 μl into 900 μl of cell culture medium. ADC dilution was dispensed (50 μl per well) into 4 replicate wells of the 96-well plate, containing 50 μl cell suspension seeded the previously. Control wells received 50 μl cell culture medium. The 96-well plate containing cells and ADCs was incubated at 37° C. in a CO 2 -gassed incubator for the exposure time. 
 At the end of the incubation period, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. MTS (Promega) was dispensed (20 μl per well) into each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37° C. in the CO 2 -gassed incubator. Well absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Percentage cell survival was calculated from the mean absorbance in the 4 ADC-treated wells compared to the mean absorbance in the 4 control untreated wells (100%). IC 50  was determined from the dose-response data using GraphPad Prism using the non-linear curve fit algorithm: sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope. 
 ADC incubation times were 4 days with SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468, WSU-DLCL2, and SU-DHL-4, 5 days for Granta-519, 6 days for BJAB and 7 days for NCI-N87. MDA-MB-468, NCI-N87, WSU-DLCL2 and SU-DHL-4 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax+10% (v/v) HyClone™ Fetal Bovine Serum, Granta-519 in DMEM+Glutamax with 10% (v/v) HyClone™ Fetal Bovine Serum, SK-BR-3 in McCoys 5A with 10% (v/v) HyClone™ Fetal Bovine Serum and BJAB in RPMI 1640+Glutamax with 20% (v/v) HyClone™ Fetal Bovine Serum. 
 CellTiter-Glo Cytotoxicity Method 
 The concentration and viability of cells from a sub-confluent (80-90% confluency) T75 flask are measured by trypan blue staining, and counted using the LUNA-II™ Automated Cell Counter. Cells were diluted and plated at 1500 cells per well (50 μl suspension per well) into white 96-well flat-bottom plates. 
 A stock solution (1 ml) of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) to be tested (20 μg per ml) was made by dilution of filter-sterilised ADC into cell culture medium. A set of 8×10-fold dilutions of stock ADC were made in a 24-well plate by serial transfer of 100 μl into 900 μl of cell culture medium. ADC dilution was dispensed (50 μl per well) into 4 replicate wells of the 96-well plate, containing 50 μl cell suspension seeded the previously. Control wells received 50 μl cell culture medium. The 96-well plate containing cells and ADCs was incubated at 37° C. in a CO 2 -gassed incubator for the exposure time. 
 At the end of the incubation period, cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo assay. CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was dispensed at 100 μl per well and shaken for 2 min before 10 min stabilisation at room temperature. Luminescence of each well was read. Percentage cell survival was calculated from the mean absorbance in the 4 ADC-treated wells compared to the mean absorbance in the 4 control untreated wells (100%). IC 50  was determined from the dose-response data using GraphPad Prism using the non-linear curve fit algorithm: sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope. 
 ADC incubation time for PC-3 is 6 days. PC-3 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax+10% (v/v) HyClone™ Fetal Bovine Serum.

 Example 8—In Vivo Assays 
 (i) Daudi 
 Conjugates tested: Conj-HLL2-1; Conj-HLL2-2; Conj-HLL2-3 
 Female CB.17 SCID mice, aged ten weeks, were injected with 0.1 ml of 1×10 7  Daudi cells subcutaneously in the right flank. When tumours reached an average size of 100-150 mm 3 , treatment began. Mice were weighed twice a week. Tumour size was measured twice a week. Animals were monitored individually. The endpoint of the experiment was a tumour volume of 1500 mm 3  or 60 days, whichever came first. 
 Groups of 10 xenografted mice were injected i.v. with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in phosphate buffered saline (vehicle) or with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of vehicle alone.

 All regimens were acceptably tolerated with little body weight loss. 
 Conj-HLL2-1: 
 The median time to end point (TTE) for vehicle-treated controls was 27.8 days, establishing a maximum possible tumour growth delay (TGD) of 32.2 days (116%) for the 60-day study. One non-treatment related death was recorded on day 28, and this animal was excluded from the analysis. 
 The 0.6 mg/kg regimen resulted in a TGD of 48.1 days (73%), which was statistically significant from controls (p<0.001). Furthermore, this regimen had five of nine 59-regression responses consisting of two partial and three complete regressions. Six animals attained the 1500 mm3 endpoint, leaving 3 survivors after 60 days. The three survivors had a mean tumour volume of 221 mm 3 . There was one non-treatment related death and this animal was excluded from the analysis. 
 The 1.8 mg/kg regimen resulted in the maximum possible, significant TGD (vs controls, p<0.001), had eight of ten 60-day survivors and produced a survival benefit that was statistically significantly different from vehicle-treated controls (p<0.001). Eight animals showed complete regression responses. Five of these animals were tumour free after 60 days. 
 Both treatment regimens produced statistically significant survival benefits compared to control (p<0.001 for both 0.6 and 1.8 mg/ml). 
 Conj-HLL2-2: 
 The median time to end point (TTE) for vehicle-treated controls was 27.8 days, establishing a maximum possible tumour growth delay (TGD) of 32.2 days (116%) for the 60-day study. 
 The 0.3 and 1 mg/kg regimens both resulted in maximum achievable TGDs (32.2 days, 116%). Both of these results were statistically significant from controls (p<0.001 for each regimen). 
 Eighty percent of 0.3 mg/kg treated animals evinced regression responses consisting of two partial responses and six complete responses, four of which remained tumour free at the study end. Four 0.3 mg/kg treated animals reached the tumour volume endpoint leaving six study survivors tumour free at the end of the study. 
 One hundred percent of 1 mg/kg treated animals showed regression responses and all animals were tumour free on day 60. 
 Both treatment regimens resulted in significant overall survival differences versus controls (controls versus either 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, p<0.0001). 
 Conj-HLL2-3: 
 The median time to end point (TTE) for vehicle-treated controls was 27.8 days, establishing a maximum possible tumour growth delay (TGD) of 32.2 days (116%) for the 60-day study. 
 The 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg regimens resulted in TGDs of 12.9 days (46%) and 24.6 days (88%). Both of these results were statistically significant from controls (p<0.001 for each regimen). 
 Thirty percent regression responses were observed in animals treated with the 0.1 mg/ml regimen with three partial responses. All the animals in this group reached the tumour volume endpoint by day 60. 
 Seventy percent of 0.3 mg/kg treated animals evinced regression responses consisting of three partial responses and four complete responses, one of which remained tumour free at the study end. Four 0.3 mg/kg treated animals reached the tumour volume endpoint leaving six study survivors tumour free at the end of the study. Seven animals in this group reached the tumour volume endpoint leaving three 60 day survivors with an MTV of 750 mm 3  at study end. 
 Both treatment regimens resulted in significant overall survival differences versus controls (controls versus either 0.1 or 0.13 mg/kg, p<0.0001). 
 (ii) JIMT-1 
 Conjugate tested: Conj-Her-3 
 Female CB.17 SCID mice, aged 10 weeks, were injected with 0.1 ml of 1×10 7  JIMT-1 cells in 50% Matrigel subcutaneously in the right flank. When tumours reached an average size of 100-150 mm 3 , treatment began. Mice were weighed twice a week. Tumour size was measured twice a week. Animals were monitored individually. The endpoint of the experiment was a tumour volume of 1000 mm 3  or 59 days, whichever came first. 
 Groups of 10 xenografted mice were injected i.v. with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in phosphate buffered saline (vehicle) or with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of vehicle alone. The concentration of ADC was adjusted to give 1 or 3 mg ADC/kg body weight in a single dose. 
 All regimens were acceptably tolerated with little body weight loss. The median time to end point (TTE) for vehicle-treated controls was 48.4 days, establishing a maximum possible tumour growth delay (TGD) of 10.6 days (22%) for the 59-day study. 
 A dose dependent effect was observed where in animals that received the 1 mg/kg dose the median tumour volume remained static until day 34, then progressed thereafter, while for animals treated with 3 mg/kg there was a small reduction in tumour size to an MTV of 81 mm 3 . Both dosing regimens resulted in a maximal TGD of 10.6 days (22%) versus the control group (p<0.001 for both treated groups). 
 The 1 mg/kg regimen resulted in nine study survivors with an MTV of 650 mm 3  and no objective regression responses. 
 The 3 mg/kg regimen resulted in nine study survivors with 20% objective regression responses consisting of two partial responses. The MTV of the study survivors was 108 mm 3 . The treatment regimens were not significantly different from each other (p>0.05). 
 Both treatment regimens resulted in significant overall survival differences versus controls (controls versus either 1 or 3 mg/kg, p<0.0001). 
 (iii) NCI-N87 
 Conjugate tested: Conj-Her-3 
 Female CB.17 SCID mice, aged ten weeks, were injected with 0.1 ml of 1×10 7  NCI-N87 cells in 50% Matrigel subcutaneously in the right flank. When tumours reached an average size of 100-150 mm 3 , treatment began. Mice were weighed twice a week. Tumour size was measured twice a week. Animals were monitored individually. The endpoint of the experiment was a tumour volume of 800 mm 3  or 81 days, whichever came first. 
 Groups of 10 xenografted mice were injected i.v. with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in phosphate buffered saline (vehicle) or with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of vehicle alone. The concentration of ADC was adjusted to give 0.3 or 1 mg ADC/kg body weight in a single dose. 
 All regimens were acceptably tolerated with little body weight loss. Six of ten control tumours reached the 800 mm 3 , with time to endpoints (TTE) ranging 36.8 to 81.0 days. The median time to end point (TTE) for vehicle-treated controls was 77 days, establishing a maximum possible tumour growth delay (TGD) of 4 days (5%) for the 81-day study. Four control animals survived with a median tumour volume (MTV) of 696 mm 3 . 
 The 0.3 and 1 mg/kg regimens resulted in TGDs of 0.5 (1%) and 4.0 days (5%) respectively. Both of these results were not statistically significant from controls, not each other (p>0.05). There were no objective regressions recorded in either group. Five 0.3 mg/kg and seven 1 mg/kg treated animals survived with MTVs of 550 mm 3  in both groups. 
 Neither treatment regimen resulted in statistically significant survival benefits compared to control (p>0.05 for both treatment groups), and there was no significant difference between the treatment groups (p>0.05).

 (vii) NCI-N87 
 Conjugates tested: Conj-Her-1, Conj-Her1+, Conj-Her-1++ 
 Female CB.17 SCID mice, aged eight weeks, were injected with 0.1 ml of 1×10 7  NCI-N87 in 50% Matrigel cells subcutaneously in the right flank. When tumours reached an average size of 100-150 mm 3 , treatment began. Mice were weighed twice a week. Tumour size was measured twice a week. Animals were monitored individually. The endpoint of the experiment was a tumour volume of 800 mm 3  or 83 days, whichever came first. 
 Groups of 10 xenografted mice were injected i.v. with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in phosphate buffered saline (vehicle) or with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of vehicle alone.

 The 6 and 18 mg/kg regimens resulted in tumor growth delays of 45.9 days (125%) and 46.2 days (126%). In the 6 mg/kg regimen the mean tumour volume for 4 mice was 564 mm 3 , with no observable regression responses. In the 18 mg/kg regimen there were nine survivors with a mean tumour volume of 108 mm 3 . There were 9 partial regressions and 1 complete regressions. 
 Conj-Her-1++: 
 The 1.5 and 3 mg/kg regimen resulted in tumor growth delays of 45.9 days (125%) and 46.2 days (126%). In the 1.5 mg/kg regimen there were two survivors with a mean tumour volume of 634 mm 3 . In the 3 mg/kg regimen there were ten survivors with a mean tumour volume of 451 mm 3 . 
 Conj-Her-1+: 
 The 3 and 6 mg/kg regimens resulted in maximum tumor growth delays of 46.2 days (126%). In the 3 mg/kg regimen there were seven survivors with a mean tumour volume of 600 mm 3 . In the 6 mg/kg regimen there were ten survivors with a mean tumour volume of 256 mm 3 . There were two partial regressions. 
 (viii) JIMT1 
 Conjugates tested: Conj-Her-1, Conj-Her-1++ 
 Female CB.17 SCID mice, aged eight weeks, were injected with 0.1 ml of 1×10 7  JIMT1 in 50% Matrigel cells subcutaneously in the right flank. When tumours reached an average size of 100-150 mm 3 , treatment began. Mice were weighed twice a week. Tumour size was measured twice a week. Animals were monitored individually. The endpoint of the experiment was a tumour volume of 1000 mm 3  or 60 days, whichever came first. 
 Groups of 10 xenografted mice were injected i.v. with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in phosphate buffered saline (vehicle) or with 0.2 ml per 20 g of body weight of vehicle alone.

 The median time to end point (TTE) for vehicle-treated controls was 37.5 days, establishing a maximum possible tumour growth delay (TGD) of 22.5 days (60%) for the 60-day study. 
 Conj-Her-1: 
 The 18 and 24 mg/kg regimens resulted in tumor growth delays of 5.3 days (14%) and 3.2 days (9%). In the 18 mg/kg regimen all animals reached the 1000 mm 3  endpoint. In the 24 mg/kg regimen there was a single survivor with a tumour volume of 968 mm 3 . Both regimens resulted in a significant overall survival difference versus controls (P<0.01). 
 Conj-Her-1++: 
 The 4, 6 and 8 mg/kg regimen resulted in tumor growth delays of 4.4 days (12%). 6.9 days (18%) and 17.7 days (47%). In the 4 mg/kg regimen all animals reached the 1000 mm 3  endpoint. In the 6 mg/kg regimen there was a single survivor with a tumour volume of 650 mm 3 . In the 8 mg/kg regimen there was a single survivor with a tumour volume of 847 mm 3 . All regimens resulted in a significant overall survival difference versus controls (P<0.01). 
 Example 9—Toxicology Assay 
 A single dose nonGLP toxicity study was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of the ADCs tested, which were: Conj-R347-1; Conj-R347-2; Conj-R347-3. 
 Male Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo, Inc) were dosed once by slow bolus intravenous injection via the tail vein with ADC. The vehicle for dilution used was 25 mM Histidine-HCl, 7% sucrose, 0.02% Polysorbate 80, pH 6.0. Parameters evaluated during the study included mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, body weights, body weight changes, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulation), and gross pathology findings. All animals were terminated on Study Day (SD) 29.

 Tolerability was determined based on toxicity end points, including mild decreases in hematological parameters, microscopic evaluations and bone marrow suppression. Based on microscopic changes in animals receiving the highest dose, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the rat after a single dose was determined to be 25 mg/kg.
