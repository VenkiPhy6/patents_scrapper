 Invention field 
 The present invention relates to medicine, microbiology and food technology field, the especially benefit wait be used as the health that is beneficial to man
The new strains of the Lactobacillus pentosus of raw bacterium. 
 
 
 Background of invention 
 Probiotics 
 Vacation of the concept from Nobel laureate Elie Metchnikoff of probiotics (probiotic) microorganism
It says, he proposes, the edible micropopulation to colon that can generate the bacterium (lactobacillus (Lactobacilli)) of fermentation generates
Active influence, so that reducing bacteriotoxin and other has the presence of the microbial activity of negative effect to human health. 
 " probiotics is the viable microbial for making consumer have benefits more more than basic natural nutrition object after it is applied ".Such as
There is the bibliography much about the serviceability of several gastrointestinal health imbalances of probiotics agents treatment in the present, and its activation is prompted to exempt from
The research of epidemic disease system and the effectiveness for preventing allergy. 
 Probiotics, which must satisfy, is related to nontoxicity, viability, several requirements of attachment and beneficial effect.Each bacterium bacterial strain
Property be unique, and other bacterial strains (Araya, M. et al., the Guidelines for of same species cannot be extrapolated to
the Evaluation of Probiotics in Food-Joint FAO/WHO Working Group.FAO/
WHO.Editor 2002.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and
World Health Organization:Ontario,Canada).Thus, it is found that having in the requirement of institute's profitable probliotics preferable
Those of performance bacterial strain is important. 
 Although the concept of probiotics is related with intestinal microflora, early in 1988 studies have shown that, it is this general
Read the vaginal flora for extending also to women.This idea has been developed for many years in several science team, this is with mirror
Making can be used for treating some lactobacillus strains of vaginal health complication and comes to an end (Anukam, K.C. et al., Clinical
study comparing probiotic Lactobacillus GR-1and RC-14with metronidazole
vaginal gel to treat symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.Microbes and
Infection.2006,Vol.8,Nos.12-13,pages 2772-2776；Larsson, P.G. et al., Human
lactobacilli as supplementation of clindamycin to patients with bacterial
vaginosis reduce the recurrence rate；a 6-month,double-blind,randomized,
Placebo-controlled study.BMC Women's Health.2008, Vol.8, No.1, page 3), to show
Probiotics is used for the concept of vaginal health. 
 Healthy vaginal flora 
 The appearance of vaginal fluid and itch is the medical most common reason of gynaecology.This may be since allergia is anti-
It answers, is contacted with irritation reagent (cloth, soap, spray etc.) or in many cases due to infection. 
 The vaginal flora of health is mainly made of lactobacillus (Lactobacilli), maintains the natural acidic pH of vagina
(between 3.9 and 4.3), to prevent other microorganisms from colonizing to it.When this indigneous flora for example passes through systemic antibiosis
When extract for treating is weakened, the infection of pathogenic species becomes may be much.The most common complication of vaginal flora of health is
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (vulvovaginal candidiasis) and bacterial vaginosis BV (bacterial
vaginosis)。 
 Vulvovaginal candidiasis 
 Mycotoruloides (Candida) is a kind of very universal yeast, can be found on a small quantity in vaginal flora without
Have any symptom of disease.When the balance of vaginal flora is destroyed, and the candida albicans compared with the amount of protectiveness lactobacillus
Belong to when group increases and symptom occurs.The classical symptom of monilial infection include pruritus of vagina and burn feeling and dyspareunia and
Coleospastia.The case where about 75% vulvovaginal candidiasis, is attributed to Candida albicans (Candida albicans), separately
There is 15% to be attributed to Candida glabrata (Candida glabrata) (Richter, S.S. et al., Antifungal
Susceptibilities of Candida Species Causing Vulvovaginitis and Epidemiology
of Recurrent Cases.J.Clin.Microbiol.2005,Vol.43,No.5,pages 2155-2162).It is estimated that
75% women breaks out (episode) in their experience in life at least once.In addition, 25% case is recurrent,
It is annual that there is four times or more breaking-outs. 
 Infection often occurs after with the treatment of the antibiotherapy with the different therapeutic purposes places of opening.It is taking containing female
The women of the oral contraceptive of hormone is also common in pregnant woman and in the women with diabetes.Monilial infection is used anti-
Epiphyte pharmaceutical, such as triazole type medicine (such as Fluconazole (fluconazole), clotrimazole (clotrimazole), Miconazole
(myconazole), Itraconazole (itraconazole)) or nystatin (nystatin) treatment.However, noticeable
It is that Candida glabrata bacterial strain tends to display and is directed to the resistance of this treatment, while up to 20% white being clinically separated
Candida albicans (Candida albicans) bacterial strain is presented to one of most typical treatment, and the resistance of Fluconazole is looked for highlight
To the importance of the new treatment means for managing vulvovaginal candidiasis. 
 Other than its acid pH, vaginal secretion (vaginal fluid) include several antimicrobial proteins, such as lysozyme,
Alexin (defensins) and lactoferrin.During vulvovaginal candidiasis, these substances is dense in about 25% women
Degree, which increases to, has exceeded normal level (Valore, E.V. et al., Reversible Deficiency of Antimicrobial
Polypeptides in Bacterial Vaginosis.Infect.Immun.2006,Vol.74,No.10,pages
5693-5702).This response is typically not enough to defence yeast such as candida albicans, because the effect of these substances is true compared to anti-
Microbial inoculum is more Bacteria suppression or bactericidal.However, resisting since the vaginal flora of health is mainly made of Lactobacillus bacteria
This abnormal increase of microprotein can contribute to the recovery for further postponing the healthy flora of vagina.In addition, this is emphasized
It needs to consider the resistance to these antimicrobial agents when searching and being suitable as the Bacillus acidi lactici of probiotics. 
 Bacterial vaginosis BV 
 Bacterial vaginosis BV is by being usually not present in vaginal flora or with the excessive of the bacterial species of minimal amount discovery
Caused by growth.The most common species are gardnerella vaginalis (Gardnerella vaginalis) and the unusual bacterium of vagina
(Atopobium vaginale), but definite cause of disease source (aetiological agent) is not yet found so far.In 5 women
Bacterial vaginosis BV will be developed into about 1 interval between 6 to 12 months.Although bacterial vaginosis BV can cause abnormal negative
Road effluent and fishlike smell, but majority of case is asymptomatic.Bacterial vaginosis BV is typically characterised by due to lactobacillus
PH caused by disappearing rises to be higher than 4.5, this further promotes the growth of other bacterial species. 
 Bacterial vaginosis BV antibiotic, as metronidazole and clindamycin (clindamicyn) are treated.However, bacillary
Vaginopathy shows high recurrence rate, 35% is up to during first month and up to 70% during First Year.Also it is observed that
It arrives, the antibiotic treatment of vaginopathy can lead to vulvovaginal candidiasis as secondary infection, because of antibiotic (especially crin
Mycin) also influence lactobacillus. 
 In addition, it has been shown that the women with bacterial vaginosis BV tends to preemie or has under-weight (small
In 2.5kg) baby.Sometimes infection can spread to fallopian tubal.Such infection is known as pelvic inflammatory disease (pelvic
Inflammatory disease, PID), and infertility and the damage to fallopian tubal can be caused, to increase the wind of ectopic pregnancy
Danger.Bacterial vaginosis BV also increases the risk of urethral infection and sexually transmitted disease. 
 For managing the probiotics of vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis BV 
 Currently there are several probiotics strains that help manages vulvovaginal candidiasis, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus
GR1 (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR1), lactobacillus fermenti RC14 (Lactobacillus fermentum
RC14), lactobacillus plantarum P17630 (Lactobacillus plantarum P17630) and lactobacillus acidophilus NAS
(Lactobacillus acidophilus NAS).However, they none test they bear in 4 infection about 1
The ability of the antimicrobial agent of the elevated concentrations occurred in example.In addition, only a kind of be used for vulvovaginal candidiasis management
Probiotic solution (BION It is made of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR1 and lactobacillus reuteri RC14 bacterial strain),
(Martinez, R.C.R. et al., Improved are supported in the clinical test for the placebo that its efficacy requirements is randomized
treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis with fluconazole plus probiotic
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14.Letters in
Applied Microbiology.2009,Vol.48,No.3,pages 269-274)。 
 On the other hand, there are two kinds of probiotic products for managing bacterial vaginosis BV, health requirements obtain at random
The clinical test of the placebo of change is supported: BION (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR1 and lactobacillus reuteri
RC14 bacterial strain) and (Lactobacillus gasseri DSM 14869 (Lactobacillus gasseri DSM 14869) and mouse
Lee's sugar lactobacillus DSM 14870 (Anukam, K.C. et al., 2006, ibid；Larsson, P.G. et al., 2008, ibid). 
 Art describes other bacterial strains as potential vagina probiotics, such as EP1436380B1, which depict from strong
The Lactobacillus pentosus for separating in the stool culture that health adult obtains and being cultivated in the presence of tetracycline
(Lactobacillus pentosus) bacterial strain NCIMB41114.This document description, since it inhibits the growth of candida albicans species,
And the bacterial strain has the resistance to tetracycline and associated antibiotic, it can be used for resisting Mycotoruloides in any area of body
The undesirable growth in domain, especially in irritable bowel syndrome.This file does not describe for Candida glabrata (Candida
Glabrata) the inhibitory activity of bacterial strain does not show that bacterial strain adheres to vagina epithelium and survives or resist in vaginal environment yet and deposits
It is antimicrobial material therein, such as the ability of lysozyme. 
 Okkers, D.J. et al. describe the pentose cream bar separated from antenatal patient's posterior fornix secretion for 1999
Bacteria strain TV35b generates bacteriocin sample peptide (pentocin TV35b), inhibits Candida albicans and some bacterial species.This article
Part does not describe the bacterial strain to inhibitory activity (Okkers, D.J. et al., the Characterization of of Candida glabrata
pentocin TV35b,a bacteriocin-like peptide isolated from Lactobacillus
pentosus with a fungistatic effect on Candida albicans,Journal of Applied
Microbiology.1999,Vol.87,No.5,pages 726-734)。 
 On the other hand, art describes the vagina bacterial strains that inhibitory activity is not presented to Candida albicans.For example, In
In Dimitonova et al. 2007, the 20 plants of lactic acid bacillus mycopremnas separated from the vaginal swab of healthy Bulgarian women are had evaluated
Inhibitory activity.20 plants of growth (Dimitonova, S.P. et al., Antimicrobial for not inhibiting Candida albicans
activity and protective properties of vaginal lactobacilli from healthy
Bulgarian women.Anaerobe.2007,Vol.13,No.5-6,pages 178-184)。 
 This field, which is also taught that, is not meant to that the bacterium bacterial strain is also for light in the presence of to the inhibitory activity of Candida albicans
The antagonist of sliding candida albicans.For example, PascualL.M. et al., in 2008, from non-pregnant, healthy, the yin of pre-menopausal women
The lactobacillus strains separated in road are accredited as Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60.Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60 is shown for urogenital
The broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity of pathogen and to usually to infecting the resistance of antibiotic opened caused by these pathogen.It should
Bacterial strain is the antagonist of 10 plants of Candida albicans, but be not 3 plants test Candida glabrata bacterial strain antagonist [Pascual,
L.M. et al., Lactobacillus rhamnosus L60, a potential probiotic isolated from the
human vagina.Journal of General and Applied Microbiology.2008,Vol.54,No.3,
pages141-148)。 
 Therefore, the fact that the described lactobacillus as potential vagina probiotics is separated from vagina is not meant to them
The inhibitory activity to Candida species is presented.Moreover, the fact that lactobacillus strains are the antagonists of Candida albicans is not
Mean other species for also having to Mycotoruloides, such as the activity of Candida glabrata.Therefore, as the short of money of Candida species
Anti-agent is not the inherent feature of lactobacillus. 
 WO 2012/101500A1 describes the effervescent agent composition of solid form, is used for vaginal application, to treat yin
Road infection.The effervescent agent composition is in Galen (galenic) component comprising causing a disease original in pesseulum for reducing and/or eliminating
Existing probiotics strain in border.The bacterial strain is from the most common large quantities of species for being used as probiotics, i.e., from lactobacillus
Belong to and selection in Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacterium).This document does not include the test for evaluating strain characteristics.The invention
Concern is designed as improving the survival of probiotics in its manufacturing process and improves the Galen composition of application.The bacterium mentioned in this document
Strain is commercially available, and the pathogen mentioned is common in vagina pathology. 
 JP2008013502 A describe by with lactic acid bacteria for example Lactobacillus pentosus ferment Cruciferae
(cruciferous) product that plant, such as process of such as cauliflower obtain treats or prevents monilial infection, such as vaginitis
Purposes.The albicans strain of preservation is tested.This document does not describe tunning for Candida glabrata
Inhibitory activity. 
 On the other hand, as explained above, about 25% experience vulvovaginal candidiasis women's medial vagina liquid
Antibacterial substance increased to over normal level.These substances have significant inhibiting effect to lactobacillus.It is seldom at present
Lactobacillus is used as vagina probiotics；However, they none after tested in antimicrobial agent in vaginal secretion increased condition
The ability of lower survival.In addition, current vagina probiotics none tested its activity, especially for Candida glabrata
Activity.Candida glabrata accounts for sizable score of monilial infection, and shows to the more resistance of current antifungal therapy,
Therefore bigger treatment challenge is presented. 
 
 
 Summary of the invention 
 As the different lactobacillus strains separated from Healthy People study extensively as a result, current inventor provides be suitble to
The new strains of the Lactobacillus pentosus of probiotics as management vagina infection.Bacterial strain I1001 is raw under the sanitary condition in difference
The vaginal flora separation of the young woman of health living.This Lactobacillus pentosus strain is on March 06th, 2009 by being located at
The preservation people AB- of Edifici Eureka, office P1M1.1, Campus UAB, 08193-Bellaterra (Spain)
Biotics, S.A are at Spain's Type Tissue Collection (Spanish Type Culture Collection)
(Colección de CultivosTipo,CECT,Edificio 3CUE,ParcCientífic,
Universitat de València,CatedráticoAgustínEscardino,9,46980-Paterna,Valencia,
Spain) preservation.After International Depository Authority announces that this Lactobacillus pentosus strain is to survive, which receives accession number
CECT7504。 
 Preservation people AB-Biotics, S.A authorized application people GYNEA Laboratorios S.L quotes representative
The European patent application of reference number P2723EP00 or by its source or from any later patents application for requiring its priority
Above-mentioned preservation biomaterial, and it is unreserved, agreed to irrevocablely according to the 33rd article of EPC from above-mentioned patent application
Preserved material is publicly available from the applying date. 
 Due to following distinctive characteristics, bacterial strain CECT 7504 is selected from the lactobacillus strain of 100 plants of separation: 
 For the height survival of the antimicrobial agent found in vaginal secretion, especially lysozyme.As explained above
, these factors usually increase in patient's subgroup (about 25% in case) with candida albicans, and may be to many benefits
Raw bacterium is very harmful.As pointed out in embodiment part, the lactobacillus in only a fraction of vagina source can be survived
Increase concentration lysozyme, can in the patient with vulvovaginal candidiasis, but be not in healthy patients discovery (see
Examples below 3, wherein testing 10 plants of lactobacillus strains).This means that not being lactobacillus to the resistance of these protein
Inherent feature.Additionally it is believed that not describing that there is the increased item of natural antimicrobial factor concentration in vaginal secretion in the prior art
The vagina probiotics for the ability survived under part.It is thus known that probiotics will not be effective to this patient's subgroup.It is unexpected
It is that bacterial strain CECT 7504 shows the significant resistance to these conditions, therefore is particularly suitable for this group of patient (thus being
especially indicated for this subset of patients).Particularly, the display pair of bacterial strain CECT 7504
Resistance (referring to fig. 2) of the lysozyme of concentration height 16mg/l.Lysozyme be found in vaginal secretion in addition to organic acid it
The antimicrobial agent of outer maximum concentration, and its activity is most directed to gram-positive organism, such as lactobacillus.On the other hand,
When being exposed to the lysozyme concentration higher than 4mg/l, commercial strain lactobacillus plantarum P17630 (L.plantarum P17630)
(ISADIN) significant decrease for showing survival rate (90%), can such as find dense in certain vulvovaginal candidiasis patients
Degree. 
 Inhibit the ability of the growth of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata simultaneously, thus show broader spectrum of activity, with
Help manages candida infection such as vulvovaginal candidiasis.As indicated in background technique and embodiment part,
The lactobacillus in some vagina sources shows the significant antagonistic activity for one or two kinds of Mycotoruloides separation strains (isolate),
But only sub-fraction shows the significant work for being directed to one group of several separation strains of two species of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata
Property (referring to embodiment 4).Therefore, as described above, inhibiting the ability of Mycotoruloides separation strains is not the inherent feature of lactobacillus.It enables
People surprisingly, shows to be directed to compared to business probiotics bacterial lactobacillus plantarum P17630, bacterial strain CECT7504 and be tested
Candida albicans three kinds of bacterial strains higher activity, and also show for Candida glabrata a kind of bacterial strain it is higher
Activity and some activity for different Candida glabrata bacterial strains, and lactobacillus plantarum P17630 and other wild-type strains
Both it shows to the low activity of the former bacterial strain and the activity (table 3) without the latter's bacterial strain to Candida glabrata. 
 The ability of the antifungal agent commonly used in management monilial infection of high concentration is survived, therefore allows the present invention
Bacterium bacterial strain and the antifungal agent be co-administered. 
 The ability of improved acidification vaginal secretion, manages to show help compared with other separation strains and commercial control
The high potentiality of bacterial vaginosis BV.The ability of vaginal secretion is acidified usually from acidification typical laboratory culture medium or the energy of cream (milk)
Power extrapolation.However, the composition (nutrients of low concentration) of vaginal secretion and the composition of laboratory cultures base full of nutrition or cream are complete
It is complete different.It replaces, tests bacterial strain of the invention in the culture medium of the practical composition of simulation vaginal secretion. 
 It is adhered strongly to the ability of vaginal epithelial cell. 
 It is well grown in industrial culture medium. 
 The good tolerance when being tested in the animal model in vaginal irritation. 
 Good tolerance and colonization ability when being tested in human volunteer. 
 In a word, it is believed that do not describe lactobacillus strains as characterized above, especially Lactobacillus pentosus in the prior art
Bacterial strain.Art describes other particularly good lactobacillus strains in one of described feature, it will be appreciated that
7504 bacterial strain of Lactobacillus pentosus CECT meets common all these speciality.The above-mentioned of vagina infection management is used for except meeting
Outside key feature, bacterial strain of the invention, which also shows, is related to lacking toxicity, viability, the good probiotics of adherency and beneficial effect
Feature.Following embodiment provides the scheme for (for example) determining each of probiotic characteristics and also shows bacterial strain CECT
7504 have fabulous probiotic characteristics. 
 Therefore, in a first aspect, the present invention provides the compositions comprising a effective amount of Lactobacillus pentosus CECT 7504.
As used herein term " effective quantity ", refers to a certain amount of medicament, sufficiently high to deliver required benefit, but it is low enough
To avoid the serious side effect within the scope of medical judgment. 
 Extremely a variety of lactic acid bacteria species have the long history of apparent safe handling (apparent safe use).
European Food Safety Authority (The European Food Safety Authority) has developed a kind of system, authorizes tool
There is the taxonomical unit for the long history of proof apparently used safely with " safety approval estimates (Qualified Presumption
Of Safety) " (QPS) state.7504 bacterial strain of CECT belongs to bacterial species (Andreoletti, O. etc. with QPS state
People, The maintenance of the list of QPS microorganisms intentionally added to
food or feed.Question no:EFSA-Q-2008-006；The EFSA Journal.2008,Vol.923,pages
1-48)。 
 The appearance and diffusion of the resistance of combating microorganisms agent cause the threat to human and animal's health in bacterium, and
Occupy main finance and social cost.When the resistance of combating microorganisms agent is that bacterial species are intrinsic, it is commonly referred to as
" plant resistance (intrinsic resistance) " (sometimes referred to as " natural resistance ").Plant resistance is estimated as presentation level
The minimum potentiality of propagation, and think the high potentiality that there is horizontal proliferation by the acquired resistance of the gene mediated added.The present invention
It was found by the inventors that the bacterial strain for forming composition of the invention is not shown to people according to the guidance of European Food Safety Authority
And/or antibiotic (ampicillin, gentamicin, streptomysin, erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin and chlorine that animal doctor is important
Mycin) any significant resistance (Bories, G. et al., Update on the criteria used in the
assessment of bacterial resistance to antibiotics of human or veterinary
Importance.The EFSA Journal.2008, Vol.732, pages 1-15), antibiotic resistance is dived to eliminate
In the risk being transferred in pathogenic species. 
 On the other hand, the present invention provides the composition comprising a effective amount of bacterial strain of the invention, is used as drug and produces
Product, drug, food, edible product, food supplement, dietetic food or personal hygiene products. 
 As mentioned above, 7504 bacterial strain of CECT shows the significant activity to Candida species.Therefore, in third
Aspect, the present invention provide composition as defined above, are used to prevent and/or treat candidiasis.This aspect can also be standby
The composition that selection of land is described as limiting in the first aspect of the present invention is used to manufacture the medicine for preventing and/or treating candidiasis
The purposes of produce product, drug, food, edible product, food supplement, dietetic food or personal hygiene products.Alternatively, this
It can be described as manufacturing the method for preventing and/or treating the candidiasis in people comprising to the institute for thering is this to need
It states people and applies a effective amount of composition limited such as the first aspect of the present invention. 
 Composition of the invention is for being susceptible to suffer from the prophylactic treatment of candidiasis individual, and also for infection Mycotoruloides
The therapeutic management of the individual of microorganism is particularly useful.Specifically, composition of the invention can be applied to infant,
Children and AIDS patient are to prevent or treat thrush (thrush) or candida albicans diaper rash.In addition, AIDS patient
It will benefit from the compositions disclosed herein, will be reduced because obtaining the probability of monilial infection, and if infected, when
The less migration of candida albicans will be undergone when orally ingestible.The composition is also used for preventing from jeopardizing the infection of fetus in pregnant woman, premature labor
Childbirth and the urinary tract road feel dye. 
 In view of the Anti-candida activity of CECT 7504 and it adheres to epithelial cell and receiving is sent out in vaginal secretion
The ability of existing antimicrobial agent, in specific embodiments, composition of the invention is particularly for preventing and/or treating
Vaginal candidiasis.In a more specific embodiment, candidiasis is caused by Candida glabrata.As explained above
, bacterial strain of the invention is particularly for preventing and/or treating the vaginal candidiasis with high inflammatory response. 
 What the term " high inflammatory response " in this specification was interpreted as observing in vulvovaginal candidiasis is contained in
(Valore, E.V. et al. are same for the increase of antimicrobial proteins in vaginal secretion, such as lysozyme, alexin and lactoferrin concentration
On).Lysozyme is one of the antibacterial material being present in vaginal secretion with higher concentration.In healthy women and by bacterial vaginosis BV
Its concentration changes 1 between 4mg/l in the women of influence, but can achieve in the women for suffering from vulvovaginal candidiasis
16mg/l or higher.Therefore, it can be made based on Lysozyme Levels according to the definition of " the high inflammatory response " of this specification.It is difficult
It establishes accordingly it is believed that there are the Lysozyme Levels of " high inflammatory response ", because this field does not describe them.In this specification
In, it is believed that there is " high inflammatory response " when lysozyme concentration is equal to or more than 4mg/l. 
 Monilial infection can also occur on other extravaginal epitheliums such as enteric epithelium or oral epithelium.Therefore, CECT
The Anti-candida activity of 7504 bacterial strains and its ability for adhering to epithelium can be used for treating and/or preventing the thought in intestines or oral cavity
The infection of pearl bacterium.Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides composition as defined above, is used to prevent and/or treat
Thrush and/or intestinal moniliasis.This aspect can also alternatively be described as in the first aspect of the present invention restriction
Composition is used to manufacture the drug products for preventing and/or treating oral cavity and/or intestinal moniliasis, drug, food, edible production
The purposes of product, food supplement, dietetic food or personal hygiene products.This can alternatively be described as preventing in people
And/or the method for treating oral cavity and/or intestinal moniliasis comprising a effective amount of of the invention to needing its people to apply
The composition that first aspect limits. 
 Finally, as described above, 7504 bacterial strain of CECT shows the ability of acidification vagina medium.Therefore, on the other hand,
The present invention provides the compositions that such as the first aspect of the present invention limits, and are used to prevent and/or treat bacterial vaginosis BV.It should
The composition that aspect can also alternatively be described as limiting in the first aspect of the present invention is used for prevention and/or bacterium for manufacturing
The use of the drug products of vaginosis, drug, food, edible product, food supplement, dietetic food or personal hygiene products
On the way.This can alternatively be described as in people prevent and/or treat bacterial vaginosis BV method comprising to need its
The people apply the composition that a effective amount of the first aspect of the present invention limits. 
 Composition of the invention can be prepared into any suitable form, will not negatively affect to form combination of the present invention
The viability of the bacterial strain of object.Specific purpose selection excipient in view of composition and the most suitable method for preparation are to make
Within the scope of medicine technology ordinary person.The composition can take orally, vagina or rectal administration, or use different applications simultaneously
Form (such as oral and vagina) is applied. 
 In this sense, composition of the invention is solid or liquid form, and can be following shape among other things
Formula: pulvis, tablet or pastille, suction tablet (sucking tablet), film preparation (film preparation), solution,
Aerosol, granula, pill, suspending agent, emulsion, capsule, enteric coated tablet (enterocoated tablet) and capsule
Agent, syrup, liquid, elixir, candy, chewing gum, suppository, micro- enema, vaginal tablets, vagina gelatine capsule, creme, gel,
Ointment, lotion, tampon, sanitary napkin, protection pad, fusion zone, sheath, pessary, spray, tincture or liquid extract. 
 Composition according to the present invention can be formulated as such form, wherein bacterial strain of the invention is unique activating agent
Or it is mixed with one or more other activating agents and/or it is with pharmaceutical excipient or in food or edible product situation
It is lower to be mixed with additive appropriate or ingredient.In one embodiment of the invention, composition extraly contains one kind
Or a variety of other activating agents.Preferably, another or multiple actives are the bacterium that antagonism does not form the present composition
Other probiotics of strain.Due to the bacterial strain in the present invention survive high concentration commonly used in management monilial infection it is antimycotic
The ability of agent, in a specific embodiment, composition of the invention can combine triazole antifungal drug object or mildew making
Element is administered in combination to prevent and/or treat candidiasis.Their compatibility proves in the following embodiments.Depending on system
Agent, can with the bacterium of purifying, with bacterial cultures, with a part of bacterial cultures, with bacterial cultures after processing,
And individually or bacterial strain is added together with suitable carrier or ingredient.Prebiotics (prebicotics) can also be added. 
 Ying Yiqi broad sense is interpreted as including any comprising active constituent term " drug products " in the present specification
Composition, in this case, bacterial strain of the invention are preferably the form of composition together with pharmaceutical excipient.Term
" drug products " are not limited to drug.Term " pharmaceutical (pharmaceutically as used herein
Acceptable) " it is related in the range of reasonable medical judgment, is suitble to contact and do not have with the tissue of subject (for example, people)
There is excessive toxicity, stimulates, allergic reaction, other problems or complication, the chemical combination to match with reasonable interests/Hazard ratio
Object, material, composition and/or dosage form.Every kind of carrier, excipient etc. are also necessary in the sense that compatible with other ingredients of preparation
It is " available ".Suitable carrier, excipient etc. can be found in standard pharmaceutical textbook. 
 Approach is examined depending on product and also depends on country, and drug products can use different form or title.
For example, drug is specific drug products.Medicine food is another certain drug product.Term " dietetic food " is used for
The food of the dietary management of " food of special medical purposes " in certain countries for referring to particular formulation and being intended for disease,
The disease has the unique nutritional need that cannot be individually met by normal diet.They are in regulation, such as U.S. 1988
Food and Drug Administration Orphan drug method amendment and European drug in committee instruction 1999/21/EC in
(the Food and Drug Administration's 1988Orphan Drug Act Amendments in the
United States,and the Commission Directive 1999/21/EC in Europe.Medical
Foods it) defines.Dietetic food is different from the food supplement of wider classification, and is different from the tradition food with health requirements
Object.Therefore, in a specific embodiment, composition of the invention is dietetic food. 
 It is generally thought that probiotic bacteria composition (probiotic bacteria composition as disclosed herein) is food supplement
Agent.Think that food supplement (also referred to as dietary supplement or nutritional supplement) is another specific drug products.This is meaning
In supplement diet and the preparation of nutrition or beneficiating ingredient is provided, the nutrition or beneficiating ingredient are not taken in normal diet usually
Or it may be not edible with enough amounts.In most cases, food supplement is considered as food product, but they are defined sometimes
For drug, natural health-care products (natural health product) or dietetic product.In the sense of the present invention, food is mended
Filling agent further includes dietetic product.Food supplement is usually with " non-prescribed medicine (over the counter) " sale, i.e., without opening
Prescription.If food supplement is using the form of pill or capsule, it is included in identical excipient used in drug.So
And food supplement can also be using the form for the food product for enhancing some nutrition (for example, stick or yogurt
(yoghurt))。 
 Therefore, in a specific embodiment, composition of the invention is food supplement. 
 If composition according to the present invention is food supplement, it itself can be applied, can with it is suitable drinkable
Liquid, such as water, yogurt, milk or fruit juice mixing, can also mix with solid or liquid food.Within a context, food
Replenishers can have tablet or pastille, pill, capsule, granula, pulvis, suspension, wafer (sachet), sugared (sweet),
Stick (bar), the form of syrup and corresponding administration form, the usually form of unit dose.Preferably, comprising of the invention
The food supplement of composition is with tablet, pastille, the form application of capsule or pulvis, to prepare the routine side of dietary supplement

 2.2 strain genotype partings 
 It is characterized by genome digestion and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).CECT7504 bacterial strain had previously been retouched
State scheme (Rodas, A.M., et al., Polyphasic study of wine Lactobacillus strains:
taxonomic implications.Int J SystEvolMicrobiol.2005,Vol.55,No.1,pages 197-
207), wherein being modified slightly.Strain growth is on MRS agar plate and at 37 DEG C, 5%CO 2 It is lower to incubate 18 hours.Collect cell
And washing 3 times in 8ml PER (in 10 milli mM Tris, pH 7.6,1M NaCl), then it is centrifuged 10 minutes at 6000rpm.
Sediment is resuspended in 700ml lysis buffer (6mM Tris, 1M NaCl, 0.1M EDTA, 0.5%SLS, 0.2% deoxidation gallbladder

 Table 2 is used for the deposition condition of this research. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As shown in Figure 1, (belonging to for bacterial strain Lactobacillus pentosus CECT7504 (I1001) of the invention and commercial control bacterial strain
In closely related species L. plantarum (P17630)), pulsed field gel electrophoresis Sfi-I and Sma-I estriction map is different
's.PFGE allows to distinguish the bacterial strain of identical type, and therefore can be used for uniquely identifying given in a bacterial species
Bacterium bacterial strain (Rodas, A.M., et al., 2005 are same as above). 
 
 
 Embodiment 3: to the resistance of vaginal secretion 
 Vaginal secretion contains a large amount of various antimicrobial agents, passes through different mechanism, such as acid pH, lysozyme, cream
Ferritin and alexin work.It is therefore shown that bacterium bacterial strain can survive in acidic environment (Dho, G., et al.,
Microbial characteristics of Lactobacillus plantarum P17630contained in
Vaginal suppositories.GIMMOC.2003.Vol.VII, No.2, pages 102-8) it is not sufficient to ensure that the bacterial strain energy
It is enough to survive in vaginal environment, because it also includes other antimicrobial agents other than acid pH. 
 Vaginal secretion (synthesis) 
 Use vaginal secretion analogies (Owen, D.H. et al., A vaginal fluid
Simulant.Contraception.1999, Vol.59, No.2, pages 91-5), following antiseptic protein is added thereto
And peptide: 3.5g/l NaCl, 1.4g/l KOH, 0.22g/l Ca (OH) 2 , 0.02g/l BSA, 2g/l lactic acid, 1g/l acetic acid,
0.16g/l glycerol, 0.4g/l urea and 5g/l glucose.PH is further adjusted to 4.2 with lactic acid. 
 Antibacterium albumen 
 Lysozyme is in vaginal secretion with one of antibacterial material existing for higher concentration.In healthy women and by bacterial vaginosis
Its concentration changes 1 between 4mg/l in the women that disease influences, but can achieve in the women for suffering from vulvovaginal candidiasis
16mg/l or higher (Valore, E.V., et al., 2006, ibid).Lysozyme has broad spectrum antibiotic activity, but such as to bacterium
Lactobacillus is especially active.It is very important that the bacterial strain for ensuring to select to survive in the lysozyme of high concentration,
To obtain the probiotics that can make that there are all women of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be benefited. 
 Antibacterium peptide 
 The activity of the alexin β -2 and β -3 for lactobacillus are had recorded in document well.However it has been found that alexin
The concentration of β -2 it is 30 times lower than alexin β -3 (Ghosh, S.K., et al., Quantification of Human beta-
defensin-2and-3in Body Fluids:Application for Studies of Innate Immunity.Clin
Chem.2007,Vol.53,No.4,pages 757-765).Concentration of the alexin β -3 in vaginal secretion can be between 1 and 5mg/l
Between. 
 On the contrary, other antimicrobial proteins such as lactoferrin has, seldom anti-lactobacillus is active, such as lactoferrin
Antibacterial activity is mainly based upon the destruction of bacterium iron metabolism, and the growth of Bacillus acidi lactici do not need iron (Archibald, F.,
Manganese:its acquisition by and function in the lactic acid bacteria.Crit
Rev Microbiol.1986,Vol.13,No.1,pages 63-109)。 
 Lactic acid bacillus mycopremna is grown overnight in MRS broth bouillon.Cell is harvested by centrifugation and with 10 7 Cfu/ml weight
It is suspended in PBS.By 20 μ l cell suspension inoculations into 200 μ l vaginal secretion analogies, it is supplemented with lysozyme (0,4 and 16mg/l
Final concentration) or 4mg/l lysozyme add alexin β -3 (0,2 and 4mg/l final concentration).In 37 DEG C of culture microtiter plate 3h, and
Remaining number of viable cells passes through serial dilution and is inoculated into MRS agar and counts in each hole.It is all experiment in triplicate into
Row. 
 In the lactic acid bacillus mycopremna that 10 plants separate, CECT7504 bacterial strain is shown simultaneously to lysozyme and alexin β -3
One of five plants of resistance.CECT7504 bacterial strain shows resistance (referring to fig. 2) to the up to lysozyme concentration of 16mg/l.Separately
On the one hand, when being exposed to 4mg/l or more, (e.g., such concentration can be in the vulvovaginal candidiasis patient of quite big score
It was found that) lysozyme concentration when, control lactobacillus plantarum P17630 (ISADIN) show viability significant decrease (90%). 
 It is worth noting that, CECT7504 bacterial strain and lactobacillus plantarum P17630 bacterial strain are to individually or molten with 4mg/l
The concentration 2mg/l and 4mg/l alexin β -3 of bacterium enzyme combination is resistant, and instruction prepares both bacterium in the vaginal environment of health
Middle survival. 
 
 
 4. antimicrobial properties of embodiment 
 4.1. it is directed to the activity of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata 
 The activity for Candida albicans and Candida glabrata is tested using agar overlay method.In short, lactobacillus
Bacterial strain growth in MRS agar (Scharlau company) is stayed overnight, and is two intersecting straight lines with the inoculation of sterile bacterium ring.At 37 DEG C
It culture plate 24 hours, is then covered with the YM culture medium (Scharlau company) of 6ml fusing, the inoculation of medium exists
The overnight culture of 20 μ l candida albicans in YM broth bouillon.Keep plate cooling and be further cultured for 14 hours, in three differences
Point measurement inhibition zone.Initially test a kind of bacterial strain (CECT1392) that lactic acid bacillus mycopremna is directed to Candida albicans.Then survey
The bacterial strain for having tried display remarkable activity is directed to the bacterial strain of the more Mycotoruloides of following four: 1472 He of Candida albicans CECT
CECT 1002 and Candida glabrata CECT 1448 and CECT 1900.All experiments carry out in triplicate. 
 From the 46 plants of lactic acid bacillus mycopremnas isolated in vaginal sample, there are 35 plants to show to Candida albicans
The remarkable activity of CECT1392.However, only 8 plants of lactic acid bacillus mycopremnas are shown to the significant of all three bacterial strains of Candida albicans
Activity.In addition, only 3 plants of lactic acid bacillus mycopremnas show the remarkable activity to both Candida albicans and Candida glabrata.Sample
As the result is shown in table 3. 
 Table 3 
 
 
 
 When compared to business probiotics lactobacillus plantarum P17630,7504 bacterial strain of CECT is shown for Candida albicans
Three kinds of bacterial strains higher activity.Most of wild type Bacillus acidi lacticis of test show the work for being at most directed to two kinds of bacterial strains
Property.Also, 7504 bacterial strain of CECT is shown for a kind of higher activity of bacterial strain of Candida glabrata and for second of bacterium
Some activity of strain, and lactobacillus plantarum P17630 and other wild-type strains show low activity for the first bacterial strain with
To inactive (table 3) of second of bacterial strain. 
 4.2. the acidification of vaginal environment 
 Be widely recognized that the basic function of healthy vaginal flora first is that be mainly acidified vagina by the production of lactic acid and acetic acid
Liquid, to prevent the undue growth of undesirable bacterial species, i.e. bacterial vaginosis BV.Therefore, for for managing bacillary yin
The probiotics of road disease, the height of lactic acid generate the property being desirable to. 
 The ability for being acidified vaginal secretion is usually acidified the ability extrapolation of typical laboratory culture medium or cream from bacterial strain.However, negative
The composition (nutrients of low concentration) of road liquid and the composition of typical laboratory culture medium full of nutrition or cream are entirely different.Cause
This grows since bacterial strain can survive and is acidified the culture medium with different compositions and estimates bacterial strain with survival, growth and acidification
The good capacity of vaginal secretion is at least risky. 
 In order to detect the potentiality of acidification vaginal secretion, 4mg/l lysozyme is supplemented (in bacterial vaginosis BV using improvement
The maximum concentration (Valore, E.V., et al., 2006, ibid) observed vaginal secretion analogies (Owen, D.H. et al.,
1999, ibid): 3.5g/l NaCl, 1.4g/l KOH, 0.22g/l Ca (OH) 2 , 0.02g/l BSA, 2g/l lactic acid, 1g/l second
Acid, 0.16g/l glycerol, 0.4g/l urea and 5g/l glucose.PH value is adjusted to 5.5 with 1N NaOH, and the Portugal of 20g/l is added
Grape sugar, to be able to detect the decline of the pH value caused by fermenting. 
 Lactobacillus strain is grown overnight in MRS meat soup, and 50 μ L are inoculated into the vaginal secretion analogies in 3ml improvement
In.The pH value determination after 37 DEG C of overnight incubations.All experiments are triplicate to be carried out. 
 In the lactic acid bacillus mycopremna tested, the highest-capacity of CECT7504 bacterial strain display acidification vaginal secretion is significant
Ground is higher than the ability (table 4) that control strain P17630 is shown.In there are the separation strains for Mycotoruloides most highly active,
The souring ability of CECT7504 bacterial strain is also best.

 Embodiment 5. adheres to vaginal epithelial cell 
 It is incubated together with culture with the lactobacillus strain that titrtated thymidine marks with converging for HeLa cell, the HeLa cell is
The cell line obtained from vagina epithelium of cervix uteri, be previously used for evaluating Bacillus acidi lactici to the adherency of vagina epithelium (Atassi, F.,
Et al., Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy
women inhibit Prevotellabivia and Gardnerellavaginalis in coculture and cell
culture.FEMS Immunology&Medical Microbiology.2006,Vol.48,No.3,pages 424-432；
Mastromarino, P., et al., Characterization and selection of vaginal Lactobacillus
strains for the preparation of vaginal tablets.Journal of Applied
Microbiology.2002,Vol.93,No.5,pages 884-893).This methodology allows to count the newborn bar of all adherency
Bacterium cell, rather than the sample segment of epithelial cell is used, and the visual meter of adhered to lactobacillus is carried out by microscopy
Number, so as to cause more reliable counting. 
 Ours experience have shown that, the precincubation in acid medium (such as vaginal secretion) can change the adherency of bacterium,
Mainly due to expressing HSP albumen in film.Additionally, it is important to note that this research is the confluent monolayer in epithelial cell
Upper progress, to simulate the truth of epithelium, rather than other probiotics as reported, single epithelium in the solution
Carried out in cell (Culici, M., et al., Adhesion of Lactobacillus plantarum P17630to

 Clinical sign 
 During research, the clinical sign of the death rate and system toxicity is not observed, and all animals survive to peace
The postmortem of row.The significant difference of weight or weight gain is not observed in the 2nd group (20mg/ml dosage).From group 3
Weight loss has been noted down in two females of (100mg/ml dosage).However, difference is not statistically significant relative to control group
(Dunnett- inspection). 
 It is found under range estimation and microscope 
 With 20mg/ml and 100mg/ml (5x10 7 Cfu/mg it behind concentration local application CECT7504 bacterial strain 7 days), sees
It observes compared to control group, the incidence of the micro- red discoloration of vagina mucosa increases.Due to immune response, observed in vagina mucosa
The inflammation and blood vessel blockage of lower layer and the increased disease incidence and/or severity of leukocyte infiltration.However, response is agent
Dependence is measured, and in 20mg/kg, change is that minimum is serious, it is slight for changing in 100mg/kg.It is overall
For, stimulation average value (MIV) obtained in the 2nd group is 0.83, shows do not have irritation anti-in the concentration of 20mg/ml
It answers.The values average value (MIV) obtained in the 3rd group is 2.33, shows there is minimal stimulation in the concentration of 100mg/ml.It must
It must consider that genital tract mucosa flora is very rare in rabbit, substantially contain staphylococcus
(Staphylococcus), micrococcus luteus (Micrococcus) and pseudomonas (Pseudomonas) (Jacques, M., etc.
People, The normal microflora of the female rabbit's genital tract.Can J Vet
Res.1986,Vol.50,pages 272-4).Therefore, different from human vagina's flora, wherein almost without lactobacillus, therefore,
The immune response to allochthon is observed after application Lactobacillus pentosus CECT7504. 
 
 
 Vagina of the embodiment 8. after repetitive administration in female volunteers colonizes and tolerance 
 Open label clinical test is carried out, in the age 18-40 years old 10 healthy women volunteers with determination
CECT7504 bacterial strain colonizes the ability (as primary endpoint) in vagina epithelium, and assesses tolerance (such as secondary end of the product
Point).To application test 3 and 5 days, whether its energy for colonizing vagina epithelium is influenced with the duration that assessment is exposed to probiotics
Power.Inclusion criteria is menstruation rule, and is ready to avoid sexuality between product date of application and in the evening before that day of sampling day.
Intravaginal product, vagina infection or women and the immunosupress that antibiotic is taken from research starting first 15 days, lactation will be used
The women or pregnant woman of phase forecloses.The program is checked and is criticized through Valld ' Hebron hospital (Barcelona) Ethics Committee
Standard, and according to Helsinki declaration and good clinical practice (Good Clinical Practice guideline) into
Row. 
 It is disintegrated mucosal adhesive intravaginal tablet with pressure (compression force) the preparation 700mg of 60N, by hydroxyl
Propyl methocel (HPMC), Lactis Anhydrous and citric acid are made and contain 100mg (1-2x10 9 Cfu CECT7504 bacterium)
Strain.Volunteer (21-36 years old, 29 years old average) is random to receive (5 women) or 5 days continuous (5 women) tablet for three days on end.Face
Before sleeping, by volunteer with apparatus for coating by tablet applications in intravaginal.1,3 Hes before first time applies and after last time application
8 days, sterile swab is used to collect vaginal fluid sample.Sample is stored in 4 DEG C until analysis.In order to assess tolerance, from vagina
3 weeks from first day of tablet application, volunteer records vaginal symptoms daily. 
 DNA is extracted from sample using EasyMag automated system (Biomerieux), and is directed to penta using specificity
The presence of CECT7504 bacterial strain in the quantitative PCR test sample of sugared lactobacillus, lactobacillus plantarum and species.Targeting amplification 16S-
144 base-pair areas in the intergenic region of 23S rRNA.With FAM label probe 5' and with NFQ-MGB (Applied
Biosystems) label probe 3'.Using TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), according to manufacturer
Specification is expanded.Heating is formed for 10 minutes by 50 DEG C, 2 minutes and 95 DEG C.After carrying out denaturation at 95 DEG C 15 seconds, at 60 DEG C
It anneals and extends 60 seconds, carry out 45 circulations.The sequence of primer and probe is (table 8) as follows. 
 Table 8 
 
 
 
 It was found that probiotics is well-tolerated.Some volunteers report slight vaginal discharge, but grind in others
Have shown that it is due to introducing product into vagina rather than due to probiotics, because this act on receiving comfort in studying carefully
The volunteer of agent product also observed (Stapleton A.E, et al., Randomized, Placebo-Controlled
Phase 2Trial of a Lactobacillus crispatus Probiotic Given Intravaginally for
Prevention of Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection.Clinical Infectious
Diseases.2011,Vol.52,Vol.10,pages1212-17).There is no discovery in the detectable of baseline in volunteer
Lactobacillus pentosus or lactobacillus plantarum DNA.However, the morning after last time administration of probiotics finds, every ml vagina
Averagely have 10 in liquid 6 DNA copy (Fig. 4).Two days later, regardless of group, still detectable probiotics.In continuous 5 days blank films
In the group of agent, 2 in 5 patients still can be detected probiotics in 8 days after last time is applied, but receive product up to 3
It can't detect in it group.
