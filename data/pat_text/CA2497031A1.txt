One method of obtaining Compound 1 is by cultivation of a strain of Micromonospora sp., i.e., 046-EC011 or [S01 ]046. One method of obtaining the derivatives involves post-biosynthesis chemical modification of Compound 1. The present invention further relates to the use of Compound 1 derivatives, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs as pharmaceuticals, in particular to their use as inhibitors of cancer cell growth, mammalian lipoxygenase, and for treating acute and chronic inflammation, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising Compound 1 derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof.      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION      The euactinomycetes are a subset of a large and complex group of Gram-positive bacteria known as actinomycetes. Over the past few decades these organisms, which are abundant in soil, have generated significant commercial and scientific interest as a result of the large number of therapeutically useful compounds, particularly antibiotics, produced as secondary metabolites. The intensive search for strains able to produce new antibiotics has led to the identification of hundreds of new species. Many of the euactinomycetes, particularly Streptomyces and the closely related Saccharopolyspora genera, have been extensively studied. Both of these genera produce a notable diversity of biologically active metabolites. Because of the commercial significance of these compounds, much is known about the genetics and physiology of these organisms.     Another representative genus of euactinomycetes, Micromonospora, has also generated commercial interest. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,541,181 (Ohkuma et al.) discloses a dibenzodiazepinone compound, specifically 5-farnesyl-4,7,9-trihydroxy-dibenzodiazepin-11-one (named "BU-4664L"), produced by a known euactinomycetes strain, Micromonospora sp. M990-6 (ATCC 55378). ECO-4601 (herein referred to as Compound 1 ) and novel Micromonospora sp. strains 046-EC011 and [S01 ]046 are disclosed in CA 2,466,340. ECO-4601 was also disclosed as Diazepinomicin in Charan et al (2004), J. Nat. Prod., vol 67, 1431-1433.      Compound 1 Although many biologically active compounds have been identified from bacteria, there remains the need to obtain novel compounds with enhanced properties.  Thus, there exists a considerable need to obtain pharmaceutically active compounds in a cost-effective manner and with high yield. The present invention solves these problems by providing new therapeutic compounds and to methods to generate these novel compounds by post-biosynthesis chemical modifications.      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION   In another aspect, the invention relates to derivatives of Compound 1 and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a derivative of Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

As used herein, the term "farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone" refers to a class of dibenzodiazepinone compounds containing a farnesyl moiety or being derived from a farnesyl moiety. The term includes, but is not limited to, a compound of Formula I, a compound selected from Compounds 2 to 76, or the exemplified compounds of the present invention, Compounds 2 to 12, 17, 18 and Compound 46. As used herein, the term "farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone" includes compounds of this class that can be used as intermediates in chemical syntheses.   As used herein, the term "compound(s) of the invention" refers to a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone as defined above and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. The term "receptor" refers to a protein located on the surface or inside a cell that may interact with a different molecule, known as a ligand, to initiate or inhibit a biological response. As used herein, the term "ligand" refers to a molecule or compound that has the capacity to bind to a receptor and modulate its activity.     As used herein, the terms "binder", "receptor binder" or "binding agent"  refers to a compound of the invention acting as a ligand. The binding agent can act as an agonist, or an antagonist of the receptor. An agonist is a drug which binds to a receptor and activates it, producing a pharmacological response (e.g. contraction, relaxation, secretion, enzyme activation, etc.). An antagonist is a drug which attenuates the effects of an agonist, or a natural ligand. Antagonism can be competitive and reversible (i.e. it binds reversibly to a region of the receptor in common with the agonist.) or competitive and irreversible (i.e. antagonist binds covalently to the agonist binding site, and no amount of agonist can overcome the inhibition).

The terms "farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producing microorganism" and "producer of farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone," as used herein, refer to a microorganism that carries genetic information necessary to produce a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound, whether or not the organism naturally produces the compound. The terms apply equally to organisms in which the genetic information to produce the farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound is found in the organism as it exists in its natural environment, and to organisms in which the genetic information is introduced by recombinant techniques. Specific organisms contemplated herein include, without limitation, organisms of the family Micromonosporaceae, of which preferred genera include Micromonospora, Actinoplanes and Dactylosporangium; the family Streptomycetaceae, of which preferred genera include Streptomyces and Kitasatospora; the family Pseudonocardiaceae, of which preferred genera are Amycolatopsis and Saccharopolyspora; and the family Actinosynnemataceae, of which preferred genera include Saccharothrix and Actinosynnema; however the terms are intended to encompass all organisms containing genetic information necessary to produce a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound. A preferred producer of a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compound includes microbial strain 046-EC011, a deposit of which was made on March 7, 2003, with the International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC), Bureau of Microbiology, Health Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2, under Accession No. IDAC 070303-01. As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, who has a disorder, e.g., a disease or condition, a symptom of disease, or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve, or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease, or the predisposition toward disease.   As used herein, a "pharmaceutical composition" comprises a pharmacologically effective amount of a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmacologically effective amount,"  "therapeutically effective amount" or simply "effective amount" refers to that amount of a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25%  reduction in that parameter.      The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to both acid addition salts and base addition salts. The nature of the salt is not critical, provided that it is pharmaceutically acceptable. Exemplary acid addition salts include, without limitation, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, carbonic, sulphuric, phosphoric, formic, acetic, citric, tartaric, succinic, oxalic, malic, glutamic, propionic, glycolic, gluconic, malefic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, pantothenic, benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, mesylic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, algenic, ~i-hydroxybutyric, malonic, galactaric, galacturonic acid and the like. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include, without limitation, metallic salts made from aluminium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, lysine, procaine and the like. Additional examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are listed in Berge et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66:2, 1-19. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from a farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone by treating the compound with the appropriate acid or base.      The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored salts or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species. Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of this invention include, without limitation, esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients and properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, MIC and Gl~o values, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the present specification and attached claims are approximations. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant figures and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the examples, tables and figures are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values may inherently contain certain errors resulting from variations in experiments, testing measurements, statistical analysis and such.      II.

Method of Making a Farnesyl Dibenzodiazepinone A. Fermentation In one embodiment, ECO-4601 is obtained by cultivating a novel strain of Micromonospora, namely Micromonospora sp. strain 046-EC011. Strain 046-EC011 was deposited on March 7, 2003, with the International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC), Bureau of Microbiology, Health Canada, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 3R2, under Accession No. 070303-01. The deposit of the strain was made under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for Purposes of Patent Procedure.  The deposited strains will be irrevocably and without restriction or condition released to the public upon the issuance of a patent. The deposited strains are provided merely as convenience to those skilled in the art and are not an admission that a deposit is required for enablement. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to use of the particular strain 046-EC011. Rather, the present invention contemplates the use of other ECO-4601 producing organisms, such as mutants or variants of 046-EC011 that can be derived from this organism by known means such as X-ray irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, treatment with nitrogen mustard, phage exposure, antibiotic selection and the like; or through the use of recombinant genetic engineering techniques, as described in Section IV below.      The farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds of the present invention may be biosynthesized by various microorganisms. Microorganisms that may synthesize the compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to bacteria of the order Actinomycetales, also referred to as actinomycetes.

The taxonomy of actinomycetes is complex and reference is made to Goodfellow, Suprageneric Classification of Actinomycetes (1989); Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Vol. 4 (Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, pp. 2322-2339); and to Embley and Stackebrandt, "The molecular phylogeny and systematics of the actinomycetes," Annu. Rev. Microbiol. (1994) 48:257-289, for genera that may synthesize the compounds of the invention. Farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producing microorganisms are cultivated in culture medium containing known nutritional sources for actinomycetes. Such media having assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen, plus optional inorganic salts and other known growth factors at a pH of about 6 to about 9. Suitable media include, without limitation, the growth media provided in Table 1. Microorganisms are cultivated at incubation temperatures of about 18 °C to about 40 °C for about 3 to about 40 days.

The culture media inoculated with the farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone-producing microorganisms may be aerated by incubating the inoculated culture media with agitation, for example, shaking on a rotary shaker, or a shaking water bath.  Aeration may also be achieved by the injection of air, oxygen or an appropriate gaseous mixture to the inoculated culture media during incubation. Following cultivation, the farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds can be extracted and isolated from the cultivated culture media by techniques known to a skilled person in the art and/or disclosed herein, including for example centrifugation, chromatography, adsorption, filtration. For example, the cultivated culture media can be mixed with a suitable organic solvent such as n-butanol, n-butyl acetate or 4-methyl-2-pentanone, the organic layer can be separated for example, by centrifugation followed by the removal of the solvent, by evaporation to dryness or by evaporation to dryness under vacuum. The resulting residue can optionally be reconstituted with for example water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methanol or a mixture thereof, and re-extracted with a suitable organic solvent such as hexane, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride or a mixture thereof.  Following removal of the solvent, the compounds may be further purified by the use of standard techniques, such as chromatography. 8. Chemical Modifications:      The farnesyl dibenzodiapezinones biosynthesized by microorganisms are subjected to random and/or directed chemical modifications to form compounds that are derivatives or structural analogs. Such derivatives or structural analogs having similar functional activities are within the scope of the present invention.  Farnesyl dibenzodiapezinone compounds may be modified using methods known in the art and described herein. Examples of chemical modifications are shown in Examples 4 to 8 and Example 15. Derivatives of the ECO-4601 molecule, for example those identified herein as the compounds of Formula I and Compounds 2 to 76, are generated by standard organic chemistry approaches. General principles of organic chemistry required for making and manipulating the compounds described herein, including functional moieties, reactivity and common protocols are described, for example, in "Advanced Organic Chemistry," 4t" Edition by Jerry March (1992), Wiley-Interscience, USA. In addition, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the synthetic methods described herein may use a variety of protecting groups, whether or not they are explicitly described. A "protecting group" as used herein means a moiety used to block one or more functional moieties such as reactive groups including oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, so that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a polyfunctional compound. General principles for the use of protective groups, their applicability to specific functional groups and their uses are described for example in T. H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3'~  Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999).      Alcohols and phenols are protected with, for example: silyl ethers (TMS: trimethylsilyl, TIPS: triisopropylsilyl), acetals (MOM: methyloxymethyl, BOM: benzyloxymethyl), esters (acetate, benzoyl) and ethers (Bn: benzyl). Alcohols are deprotected by conditions such as: TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) for silyl ethers, aqueous acid catalysis for acetals and esters, saponification for esters, and hydrogenolysis for Bn and BOM. Amine is protected using standard amino acid protecting groups, for example, carbamates (such as t-butyl (BOC) and benzyl (CBZ)), fluorene derivatives (such as FMOC: N (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-), etc.  Amine is deprotected by conditions such as: acid hydrolysis for BOC, hydrogenolysis for CBZ, or base treatment for FMOC. All protection and deprotection conditions are demonstrated in the Greene et al reference above.  Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many synthetic chemical processes may be used to produce derivatives of Compound 1. The following schemes are exemplary of the routine chemical modifications that may be used to produce compounds of Formula I. Any chemical synthetic process known to a person skilled in the art providing the structures described herein may be used and are therefore comprised in the present invention.      Scheme 1: Phenolic alcohol(s) modifications OH Rs_X ~z~ s Rs~~O~X ~ O R      O wherein, R5 and Rs are each selected from alkyl, alkalene, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl; and X is a suitable leaving group.

In Scheme 2, amine group is optionally alkylated or acylated. Amine is alkylated using an RX alkylating agent such as dialkyl sulfates and alkyl halide, preferably RX is an alkyl halide and a base is used. An amine is also acylated when reacted with an activated carboxylic acid such as acid halides, anhydrides and N-hydroxysuccinimide esters or with carboxylic acids and coupling agents in the presence of a base like diisopropylethylamine. Scheme 2 is used to obtain Compounds 2, 3, 13, 14 and 60 to 76 from Compound 1.      Scheme 3: Double bonds) modifications H ~w / 1ol..i ~ H+      O OH      H Oa H H OH      O H~ ~ ~ OH      H      H H In Scheme 3, double bond is modified by hydrogenation, epoxidation and ozonolysis.

The amount of the compound of the present invention in a unit dosage comprises a therapeutically-effective amount of at least one active compound of the present invention which may vary depending on the recipient subject, route and frequency of administration. A recipient subject refers to a plant, a cell culture or an animal such as an ovine or a mammal including a human.      According to this aspect of the present invention, the novel compositions disclosed herein are placed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and are delivered to a recipient subject (including a human subject) in accordance with known methods of drug delivery. In general, the methods of the invention for delivering the compositions of the invention in vivo utilize art-recognized protocols for delivering the agent with the only substantial procedural modification being the substitution of the compounds of the present invention for the drugs in the art-recognized protocols.      The compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating pre-cancerous or cancerous conditions, and acute or chronic inflammatory disease.  As used herein, the term "unit dosage" refers to a quantity of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention that elicits a desired therapeutic response. As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound of the present invention that prevents the onset, alleviates the symptoms, or stops the progression of pre-cancerous or cancerous condition.  The term "treating" is defined as administering, to a subject, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of the present invention, both to prevent the occurrence of inflammation or pre-cancer or cancer condition, or to control or eliminate inflammation or pre-cancer or cancer condition. The term "desired therapeutic response refers to treating a recipient subject with a compound of the present invention such that a pre-cancer or cancer condition is reversed, arrested or prevented in a recipient subject.   The compounds of the present invention can be administered as a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. The treatment regime may require administration over extended periods of time, e.g., for several days or for from two to four weeks. The amount per administered dose or the total amount administered will depend on such factors as the nature and severity of the disease condition, the age and general health of the recipient subject, the tolerance of the recipient subject to the compound and the type of the inflammatory disorder, or type of cancer. A compound according to this invention may also be administered in the diet or feed of a patient or animal. The diet for animals can be normal foodstuffs to which the compound can be added or it can be added to a premix.   The compounds of the present invention may be taken in combination, together or separately with any known clinically approved antibiotic, inflammation or anti-cancer agent to treat a recipient subject in need of such treatment.      V. Method of Inhibiting Tumor Growth In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting tumor growth. Compounds as described herein can possess anti-tumor activity.  The compounds are effective against mammalian tumor cells such as leukemia cells, melanoma cells, breast carcinoma cells, lung carcinoma cells, pancreatic carcinoma cells, ovarian carcinoma cells, renal carcinoma cells, colon carcinoma cells and glioma cells. The antitumor method of the invention results in inhibition of tumor cells. The term "inhibition", when used in conjunction with the antitumor method refers to suppression, killing, stasis, or destruction of tumor cells. The antitumor method preferably results in prevention, reduction or elimination of invasive activity and related metastasis of tumor cells. The term "effective amount" when used in conjunction with the antitumor cell method refers to the amount of the compound sufficient to result in the inhibition of mammalian tumor cells.      The inhibition of mammalian tumor growth according to this method can be monitored in several ways. First, tumor cells grown in vitro can be treated with the compound and monitored for growth or death relative to the same cells cultured in the absence of the compound. A cessation of growth or a slowing of the growth rate (i.e., the doubling rate), e.g., by 10% or more, is indicative of tumor cell inhibition. Alternatively, tumor cell inhibition can be monitored by administering the compound to an animal model of the tumor of interest. Examples of experimental animal tumor models are known in the art and described in the examples herein. A cessation of tumor growth (i.e., no further increase in size) or a reduction in tumor size (i.e., tumor volume) or cell number (e.g., at least a 10% decrease in either) in animals treated with a compound as described herein relative to tumors in control animals not treated with the compound is indicative of tumor growth inhibition. To monitor the efficacy of tumor treatment in a human, tumor size or tumor cell titer is measured before and after initiation of the treatment, and treatment is considered effective if either the tumor size or titer ceases further growth, or if the tumor is reduced in size or titer, e.g., by at least 10% or more (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or even 100%, that is, the absence of the tumor). Methods of determining the size or cell titer of a tumor in vivo vary with the type of tumor, and include, for example, various imaging techniques well known to those in the medical imaging or oncology fields (MRI, CAT, PET, etc.), as well as histological techniques and flow cytometry.    For the anti-tumor method of the invention, a typical effective dose of the compounds given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight of the subject.      VI. Method of Treating Cancer In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating a precancerous or cancerous condition in a mammal, comprising the steps of administrating a pharmaceutical composition, containing a dibenzodiazepinone compound of the present invention in combination with a physiologically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the compound is represented by Formula i. As described elsewhere in the application, the compounds of the present invention can have antitumor activity. Specifically, the compounds are effective against mammalian tumor cells such as leukemia cells, melanoma cells, breast carcinoma cells, lung carcinoma cells, pancreatic carcinoma cells, ovarian carcinoma cells, renal carcinoma cells, colon carcinoma cells, prostate carcinoma cells and glioma cells.      In addition, the compound of Formula I is bioavailable via the oral, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous administration. Furthermore, as is described within the Examples section, the compounds of the present invention penetrate into brain tissues, and therefore can be useful in the treatment of numerous pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions of the brain.     The cancer treatment method preferably results in prevention, reduction or elimination of invasive activity and related metastasis of tumor cells. The term "therapeutically effective amount" when used in conjunction with the cancer treatment method refers to the amount of the compound sufficient to result in the prevention, reduction or elimination tumors or cancer in a mammal.   The treatment of cancer according to this method can be monitored in several ways. To monitor the efficacy of tumor treatment in a human, tumor size or tumor cell titer is measured before and after initiation of the treatment, and treatment is considered effective if either the tumor size or titer ceases further growth, or if the tumor is reduced in size or titer, e.g., by at least 10% or more (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or even 100%, that is, the absence of the tumor). Methods of determining the size or cell titer of a tumor in vivo vary with the type of tumor, and include, for example, various imaging techniques well known to those in the medical imaging or oncology fields (MRI, CAT, PET, etc.), as well as histological techniques and flow cytometry. For the cancer treatment method of the invention, a typical effective dose of the compounds given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight of the subject. Alternatively, compounds can be given intravenously, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously at a range from about 5 to about 300 mg/kg.    In addition to the compounds of this invention, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prodrugs of the compounds of this invention may also be employed in compositions to treat or prevent the above-identified disorders.      A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.      Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of this invention include, without limitation, esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters.      VII. Method of Inhibiting Lipoxygenase In another embodiment, the present invention also provides for a method of treating diseased states, in particular inflammation, caused by the 5-lipoxygenase system and/or by the synthesis of the Leukotrienes C4, D4, E4 and F4 as well as Leukotriene B4 in mammals, especially in human subjects. This method comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The compound of Formula I may be used alone or in combination with other anti-inflammatory compounds to treat or prevent disease states related to inflammation including pulmonary conditions, inflammation, cardiovascular conditions, central nervous system conditions or skin conditions. More specific diseases include gastritis; erosive esophagitis; inflammatory bowel disease; ethanol-induced hemorrhagic erosions; hepatic ischemia; ischemic neuronal injury; noxious agent induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, neuronal or myocardial tissue; liver parenchyma) damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CC14 and D-galactosamine; ischemic renal failure; disease-induced hepatic damage; trauma- or stress-induced cell damage; asthma, multiple sclerosis, ischemic reperfusion, edema, rheumatoid arthritis, viral encephalitis; bacterial pneumonia, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease and glycerol-induced renal failure. For the method of the invention related to the 5-lipoxygenase system and/or the biosynthesis of Leukotrienes, a typical effective unit dose of a compound of Formula I, or an analog given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight of the subject.   The inhibition of lipoxygenase enzymes is monitored using methods well known in the art and as described in the examples herein. A decrease in enzyme activity by at least 10%, relative to the activity in the absence of a compound as described herein is indicative of effective inhibition of lipoxygenase activity.    Farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds useful according to the invention can be used to reduce or prevent inflammation. Among the hallmarks of local acute inflammation are heat, redness, swelling, pain and loss of function. These changes are induced largely by changes in vascular flow and caliber, changes in vascular permeability and leukocyte exudation (Robbins et al., "Pathologic Basis of Disease", 6tn Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA). Anti-inflammatory therapy performed using compounds useful according to the invention can be monitored for success by tracking any of these changes. For example, a decrease in swelling (e.g., at least 10% decrease following treatment) or reported pain (e.g., a sustained decrease of 1 point or more on a 1-10 scale reported by the patient, with 10 being the worst pain experienced in association with this disorder prior to treatment, and 0 being no pain) can be used to indicate successful treatment.  Other measurable hallmarks of inflammation include leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory cytokine levels. These hallmarks can be monitored by biopsy of the affected tissue. A decrease of 10% or more in leukocyte infiltration in fixed, stained tissue relative to infiltration in similar tissue prior to treatment can be used to indicate successful treatment, as can a decrease of 10% or more in the level of any given inflammatory cytokine, relative to the level before treatment. Those skilled in the art can readily assay for inflammatory cytokine levels in tissue, blood, or other fluid samples. Alternatively, the level of systemic indicators of inflammation such as C reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be monitored.  Each of these has established normal ranges in medicine, and treatment is considered successful if one or more of such indicators goes from outside the normal range to inside the normal range after the initiation of treatment.      VIII. Method of Bindin tq o Peripheral-type Benzodiazepine Receptor PBR) PBR receptor is a mitochondria) protein, involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport for the outer to the inner mitochondria) membrane, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. PBR is a critical component of the mitochondria) permeabilitytransition pore (MPTP), which is intimately involved in the initiation and regulation of apoptosis. PBR overexpression is also found to be a prognostic indicator of the aggressive phenotype at least in breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. PBR expression is also correlated with the quality of kidney preservation.  Overexpression is also found to have correlation with, inflammation and autoimmune diseases, viral infections, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.      The method of treatment of a subject with a condition which needs administration of a PBR binding agent is accomplished using methods known to the art (for example see: cancer treatment: Starosta-Rubinstein et al (1987), Proc.  Nat). Acad. Sci. USA, vol 84, no 3, 891; Junck et al (1989), Ann. Neurol.,vol 26, 752;  Maaser et al (2002), Clin. Cancer Res., vol 8, 3205; Alzheimer's disease : Owen ef al (1983), Br.     Res., vol 273, 373; Diorio et al (1991 ), Neurobiology of Aging, vol 12, 255;  Huntington's disease : Messmer et al (1998), Neuroscience Letters, vol 241, 53; Multiple sclerosis Debruyne et al (2002), Acta Neul. 8e1., vol 102, no 3, 127) . The method comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The compound may be used alone or in combination with other compounds to treat or prevent disease states related to cancer, inflammation/auto-immune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, skin or pulmonary inflammation), infections (antiparasitic), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzeihmer's disease, Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis) and stress. For the method of the invention related to the binding of PBR, a typical effective unit dose of the compound of the invention given orally or parenterally would be from about 5 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the subject with a daily dose ranging from about 15 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight of the subject.     The binding of PBR is monitored using methods well known in the art and as described in the examples herein. For example, cancer treatment is monitored by correlation with tumor grade and patient survival. Imaging is used to monitor efficacy of the compounds in neurodegenerative diseases. Farnesyl dibenzodiazepinone compounds useful according to the invention can be used to reduce or prevent inflammation. Inflammation treatment is monitored as in Section VII above.    In addition to the compounds of this invention, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or prodrugs of the compounds of this invention may also be employed in compositions to treat or prevent the above-identified disorders.      A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prodrug" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound of this invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention or an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.      Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of this invention include, without limitation, esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters.

Other preferred media for the production of Compound 1 by fermentation are provided in Table 1.     EXAMPLE 2: ISOLATION OF COMPOUND 1 500 mL ethyl acetate was added to 500 mL of fermentation broth prepared as described in Example 1 above. The mixture was agitated for 30 minutes on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm to create an emulsion. The phases were separated by centrifugation and decantation. Between 4 and 5 g of anhydrous MgS04 was added to the organic phase, which was then filtered and the solvents removed in vacuo. An ethyl acetate extract from 2 L fermentation was mixed with HP-20 resin (100 mL; Mitsubishi Casei Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in water (300 mL). Ethyl acetate was removed in vacuo, the resin was filtered on a Buchner funnel and the filtrate was discarded. The adsorbed HP-20 resin was then washed successively with 2 x 125 mL of 50% acetonitrile in water, 2x125 mL of 75% acetonitrile in water and 2 x 125 mL of acetonitrile.      Fractions containing Compound 1 were evaporated to dryness and 100 mg was digested in the 5 mL of the upper phase of a mixture prepared from chloroform, cyclohexane, methanol, and water in the ratios, by volume, of 5:2:10:5. The sample was subjected to centrifugal partition chromatography using a High Speed Countercurrent (HSCC) system (Kromaton Technologies, Angers, France) fitted with a 200 mL cartridge and prepacked with the upper phase of this two-phase system.  The HSCC was run with the lower phase mobile and Compound 1 was eluted at approximately one-half column volume. Fractions were collected and Compound 1 was detected by TLC of aliquots of the fractions on commercial Kieselgel 60F2sa plates. Compound could be visualized by inspection of dried plates under UV light or by spraying the plates with a spray containing vanillin (0.75%) and concentrated sulfuric acid (1.5%, v/v) in ethanol and subsequently heating the plate. Fractions contained substantially pure Compound 1, although highly colored. A buff-colored sample could be obtained by chromatography on HPLC as follows.  
 6 mg of sample was dissolved in acetonitrile and injected onto a preparative HPLC column (XTerra ODS (l0pm), 19x150mm, Waters Co., Milford, MA), with a 9 mUmin flow rate and UV peak detection at 300 nm. The column was eluted with acetonitrile/buffer (5 mM of NH4HC03) according to the following gradient shown in Table 2.

Alternative Protocol 1 Compound 1 was also isolated using the following alternative protocol. At the end of the incubation period, the fermentation broth from the baffled flasks of Example 1 was centrifuged and the supernatant decanted from the pellet containing the bacterial mycelia. 100 mL of 100% MeOH was added to the mycelial pellet and the sample was stirred for 10 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes. The methanolic supernatant was decanted and saved. 100 mL of acetone was then added to the mycelial pellet and stirred for 10 minutes then centrifuged for 15 minutes. The acetonic supernatant was decanted and combined with the methanolic supernatant. Finally, 100 mL of 20% MeOH/H20 was added to the mycelial pellet, stirred for 10 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes. The supernatant was combined with the acetonic and methanolic supernatants.      The combined supernatant was added to 400 ml of HP-20 resin in 1000 mL of water and the organics were removed in vacuo. The resulting slurry was filtered on a Buchner funnel and the filtrate was discarded. Adsorbed HP-20 resin was washed successively with 2x500mL of 50% MeOH/H20, 2x500mL of 75% MeOH/H20 and 2x500mL of MeOH.      The individual washes were collected separately and analyzed by TLC as described above. Those fractions containing Compound 1 were evaporated to near dryness and lyophilized. The lyophilizate was dissolved in methanol and injected onto a preparative HPLC column (Xterra ODS (10~,m), 19x150mm, Waters Co., Milford, MA) with a flow rate of 9 mUmin and peak detection at 300 nm.  The column was eluted with acetonitrile/buffer (5 mM of NH4HC03) according to gradient shown in Table 3. Teble 3 Time min        Buffer %        Acetonitrile Fractions containing Compound 1 were combined, concentrated and lyophilized to yield about 33.7 mg of compound.      Alternative Protocol 2 liters of the whole broth from Example 1 are extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate and the two extracts are combined and concentrated to dryness. The dried extract is weighed, and for every gram of dry extract, 100 mL of MeOH-H20 (2:1 v/v) and 100 mL of hexane is added. The mixture is swirled gently but well to achieve dissolution. The two layers are separated and the aqueous layer is washed with 100 mL of hexane. The two hexane layers are combined and the combined hexane solution is washed with 100 mL methanol:water (2:1, v/v). The two methanol:water layers are combined and treated with 200 mL of EtOAc and 400 mL  of water. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice more with 200 mL portions of EtOAc. The EtOAc layers are combined and concentrated. The residue obtained will be suitable for final purification, either by HSCC or by HPLC as described above. This extraction process achieves a ten-fold purification when compared with the extraction protocol used above.

Wt.: 462.58 H   The structure of Compound 1 (ECO-4601 ) was derived from spectroscopic data, including mass, UV, and NMR spectroscopy. Mass was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry to be 462.6, UVmax 230nm with a shoulder at 290 nm. Mass data confirmed a calculated molecular weight of 462.58 and a molecular formula of C28H34N2O4. NMR data were collected dissolved in MeOH-d4 including proton (Figure 1 ), and multidimensional pulse sequences gDQCOSY, gHSQC, gHMBC, and NOESY. A number of cross peaks in the 2D spectra of ECO-4601 are key in the structural determination. For example, the farnesyl chain is placed on the amide nitrogen by a strong cross peak between the proton signal of the terminal methylene of that chain at 4.52 ppm and the amide carbonyl carbon at 170 ppm in the gHMBC experiment.  This conclusion is confirmed by a cross peak in the NOESY spectrum between the same methylene signals at 4.52 ppm and the aromatic proton signal at 6.25 ppm from one of the two protons of the tetra substituted benzenoid ring. Assignement of proton and carbon signals are shown in Table 4.      Based on the mass, UV and NMR spectroscopy data, the structure of the compound was determined to be the structure of Compound 1 shown above.

Hexahydro Compound 46, was prepared and identified according to the following procedure:      Preparation:      A solution of Compound 1 (51.1 mg in 3.0 mL MeOH) was stirred under hydrogen gas overnight in presence of platinum oxide (Pt02,10 mg) as a catalyst. The reaction mixture was filtered and purified by direct preparative HPLC using Phenomenex MAX PR 21.2 x 200 mm column (20 mUmin, H20/CH3CN gradient 30:70-30:70, 0-2 min; 30:70-0:100, 2-20 min). Fractions having a retention time of 12.8 min were combined to give 45.2 mg of Compound 46.      Structure elucidation:  Calculated molecular weight (468.63) and formulae (C2sH4oN2O4) were confirmed by mass spectral analysis. Compound 46 mass spectra gave a (M-H)- molecular ion of 467.35 by negative ionization and a (M+H)+ molecular ion of 469.43 by positive ionization. Proton NMR spectral analysis of Compound 46 is shown in Table 9.  Signals were easily assigned based on Compound 1 structure knowledge. As expected, aliphatic proton signals at positions 1'-11' all have very close chemical shifts ranging from about 1 to 1.75 ppm (integrating for 19 protons), methyl protons at positions 12' and 1 "-3" are all very close as well (shifts 0.8-0.95 ppm, integrating for 12 protons). These signals are also complex from the fact that 4 diastereomers of positions 3', 7 and 11' are present in the mixture, and in different proportions. Labile protons were not observed since NMR was done in deuterated methanol.

Monoepoxide Compounds 17 and 18, were prepared and identified according to the following procedure:      Preparation:      A mixture of Compound 1 (24.0 mg) and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA, 7.8 mg) in THF (1.0 mL) were stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with MeOH (1.0 mL) and subjected to purification on Waters HPLC  using a Photodiode Array detector. The mixture was purified by multiple injections on a Nova PackT"" C-18 25 x 200 mm column (20 mUmin, H20/CH3CN gradient 80:20-30:70, 0-8 min; 30:70-0:100, 8-20 min). Pure Compound 17 (2.11 mg) and Compound 18 (1.68 mg) were obtained by concentration in vacuo of the combined fractions respectively having retention time 11.2 min and 10.6 min.      Structure elucidation:      Calculated molecular weights (478.58) and formulae (C2sH~N205) were confirmed by mass spectral analysis. Compound 17 mass spectra gave a (M-H)-molecular ion of 477.34 by negative ionization and a (M+H)+ molecular ion of 479.44 by positive ionization. Compound 18 mass spectra gave a (M-H)- molecular ion of 477.34 by negative ionization and a (M+H)+ molecular ion of 479.40 by positive ionization. Proton NMR spectral analysis of Compounds 17 and 18 is shown in Table 10.  Signals were easily assigned based on Compound 1 structure knowledge. As expected, epoxide protons signals were shifted upfield, compared to the alkene protons of Compound 1 (from 5.09 to 2.75 ppm for Compound 17, and from 5.06 to 2.73 ppm for Compound 18).

Signals are very close, and are interchangeable EXAMPLE 9: PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY PROFILE      Compound 1 and analogs of Compounds 1 referred to herein as Compounds 2 to 12 and Compound 46 were tested for binding against a variety of enzymes and/or receptors. These enzymes or receptor used for these assays were known to be involved in anticancer activity of known compounds, as well as other diseases.  Data were also compared to inhibition of GABAA Central Benzodiazepine Receptor, to show selectivity.      A. Enzymes and Receptors: 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), the initial reaction leading to formation of leukotrienes. Eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid by the action of lipoxygenases or cycloxygenases have been found to be involved in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases (i.e. asthma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia, edema) as well in neurodegeneration (Alzheimer disease), aging and various steps of carcinogenesis, including tumor promotion, progression and metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether ECO-4601, is able to block the formation of leukotrienes by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of human 5-LO. AcyICoA-Cholesterol Acyltransferase, Hepatic (AcoA-AT) converts cholesterol to colesteryl esters and is involved in the development of artherioscerosis. Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) enzyme is made only in response to injury or infection.   It produces prostaglandins involved in inflammation and the immune response.      Elevated levels of COX-2 in the body have been linked to cancer.      The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR or PBenzR) is a well-characterized receptor known to be directly involved in diseases states. PBR  is involved in the regulation of immune responses. These diseases states include tumors, inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), parasitic infections and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer, Huntington and Multiple Sclerosis). Leukotriene, Cysteinyl (CysLT~) is involved in inflammation and CysLTi-selective antagonists are used as treatment for bronchial asthma. CysLT, and 5-LO were found to be upregulated in colon cancer.      GABAA Central Benzodiazepine Receptor (CBenzR or CBR) binding is involved in anxiolitic activities.      B. General Procedures:      The procedures used were based on known assays: AcoA-AT (from rat; Ref: Largis et al (1989), J. Lipid. Res., vol 30, 681-689), COX-2 (human; Ref:  Riendeau et al (1997), Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol 75, 1088-1095 and Warner ef al (1999), Pro. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, vol 96, 7563-7568), 5-LO (human; Ref: Carter et al (1991 ), J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., vol 256, no 3, 929-937, and Safayhi et al (2000), Planta Medica, vol 66, 110-113), PBenzR (from rat; Le Fur et al (1983), Life Sci. USA, vol 33, 449-457), CvsLT, (human; Martin et al (2001 ), Biochem. Pharmacol., vol 62, no 9, 1193-1200) and CBenR (from rat; Damm et al (1978), Res. Comm. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol., vol 22, 597-600 and Speth et al (1979), Life Sci., vol 24, 351-357).      C. Binding assay of Compound 1 on 5-LO:     Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNs) were isolated through a Ficoll-Paque density gradient. PMNs were stimulated by addition A23187 (30 NM  final concentration). Stimulated PMNs were adjusted to a density of 5 x106 cells/mL  in HBBS medium and incubated with the vehicle control (DMSO), ECO-4601 (at final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 NM) and NDGA as positive control (at final concentrations of 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.03 NM) for 15 minutes at 37°C.  Following incubation, samples were neutralized with NaOH and centrifuged. Leukotriene B4 content was measured in the supernatant using an Enzyme Immunosorbant Assay (EIA) assay. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Results shown in Figure 2 demonstrated that ECO-4601 inhibited the activity of human 5-LO with an apparent IC~o = 0.93 NM (versus 0.1 NM for the positive control NDGA) and therefore displays anti-inflammatory properties.      D. Percentage inhibition or binding of Compound 1-12 and 46:      Binding assays were done for each of Compounds 1-12 and 46 using AcoA-AT, COX-2, 5-LO, PBenzR and CysLTi enzymes. The procedures used are based on the respective references mentioned above and the conditions are summarized in Tables 11 (enzyme assays) and 12 (radioligand receptor assays).

None of them significantly binded the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBenzR), which showed selectivity was present.      Cytotoxic activity (Gl5o) of these compounds are shown in Example 10.      EXAMPLE 10. IN VITRO CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS 1-12 AND 46 Cytotoxic activities were determined in vitro for exemplified Compounds 1-12 and 46 to determine the concentration of each compound needed to obtain a 50%  inhibition of cell proliferation (GlSO). The GlSO value emphasizes the correction for the cell count at time zero and, using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Tz), control growth, (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], Gl5o is calculated as [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] x 100 = -50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net DNA increase in control cells during the drug incubation.  Compounds were tested in four cell lines: HT-29 (colorectal carcinoma), SF268 (CNS), MDA (mammary gland adenocarcinoma) and PC-3 (prostate adenocarcinoma). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO. Dilution in vehicle to concentrations of 30, 10, 3, 1 and 0.3 NM were prepared immediately before assays. Depending on the cell lines growth characteristics, 4000-i 0000 cells were plated in two 96-wells pates (day 0) and incubated for i 6 hours. The following day, propidium iodide ws added to one of the two plates and fluorescence measured (Tz). Test compounds were added to the second plate, as well as vehicle control, and cells further incubated for 96 hours. Each compound was tested at each concentration and in triplicates. The equivalent cell number was determined after adding propidium iodide by measuring the signal by fluorescence (C for control). GlSO results were calculated using the formula above and are shown in Table 14.

Compound 8 was not active at 30 pM against these four cell lines, but showed a 55% binding to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in Example 9. It is expected that this compound is active at higher concentration levels or on different strains than the four strains used.      Compound 2 has an unexpected increase in cytotoxic activity compared to parent Compound 1. A fifty fold increase of activity was observed against HT-29 cell line. Cytotoxic activity (GlSO) of Compound 2 for the other three strains was outside the expected range of concentrations used in the first tests. The second test showed nanomolar activities for Compound 2, a 100-fold increase in potency.      EXAMPLE 11. IN VITRO ANTICANCER ACTIVITY OF COMPOUND 1 AGAINST      HUMAN AND ANIMAL TUMOR CELL LINES FROM VARIOUS TISSUES Culture conditions: The cell lines listed in Table 15 were used to characterize the cytotoxicity of ECO-4601 against human and animal tumor cell lines. These cell lines were shown to be free of mycoplasma infection and were maintained in the appropriate media (Table 15) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin, under 5% C02 at 37°C. Cells were passaged two to three times per week. Viability was examined by staining with 0.25% trypan blue and only flasks where cell viability was >95% were used for this study. Cell lines amplification and platinq: Tumor cells were seeded (1-3 x 103 cells per 100 ~L) in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% C02 for 16 hrs before treatment in drug-free medium supplemented with 10% serum. Evaluation of inhibitory activity on cell proliferation: Cells were incubated for 96 hrs with 6 logo-fold concentrations of the test substance starting at lONg/ml (20 NM).  The test substance stock solution (5 mg/mL) was initially diluted at 1/70 fold in medium supplemented with serum. Other concentrations were then obtained from 1/10 fold successive dilutions in the same supplemented medium. Cell survival was evaluated 96 h later by replacing the culture media with 150 pL fresh medium containing 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.4. Next, 50 NL of 2.5 mg/mL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, was added. After 3-4h of incubation at 37°C, the medium and soluble MTT was removed, and 200 NL of dimethyisulfoxide was added to dissolve the precipitate of reduced MTT followed by addition of 25 pL glycine buffer (0.1 M  glycine plus 0.1 M NaCI, pH 10.5). The absorbance was determined at 570 nm with a microplate reader. Results were expressed as the concentration of drug which inhibits 50% of the cell growth (IC5o). The low micromolar levels of ICSO values shown in Table 15 demonstrated a pharmacologically relevant cytotoxic activity of ECO-4601 against a variety of tumor types such as leukemias, melanomas, pancreatic and breast carcinomas.

IN VITRO ANTICANCER ACTIVITY OF COMPOUND 1 AGAINST      VARIOUS HUMAN TUMOR CELL LINES FROM THE U.S. NCI PANEL A study measuring the in vitro antitumor activity of ECO-4601 was performed by the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) against panel of human cancer cell lines in order to determine the ECO-4601 concentrations needed to obtain a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (GlSO).  The operation of this unique screen utilizes 50 different human tumor cell lines, representing leukemia, melanoma and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and kidney. Culture conditions and platina: The human tumor cell lines of the cancer-screening panel were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, cells were inoculated into 96 well microtiter plates in 100 NL at plating densities ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines (Table 16). After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% COz, 95% air and 100%  relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. After 24 h, two plates of each cell line were fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz). Evaluation of inhibitory activity on cell proliferation: ECO-4601 was provided as a lyophilized powder with an estimated purity of 90+%. The compound was stored at -20°C until day of use. ECO-4601 was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate was thawed and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50Ng/mL gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold or ~h log serial dilutions were made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control. Aliquots of 100 NI of these different drug dilutions were added to the appropriate microtiter wells already containing 100 NI of medium, resulting in the required final drug concentrations (8.0 x 10-5 M to 8.0 x 10-9 M). Following drug addition, the plates were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37°C, 5% C02, 95% air, and 100% relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay was terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells were fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 NI of cold 50% (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10% TCA) and incubated for minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were discarded, and the plates were washed five times with tap water and air-dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100 NI) at 0.4%  (w/v) in 1 % acetic acid was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye was removed by washing five times with 1 % acetic acid and the plates were air-dried. Bound stain was subsequently solubilized with 10 mM trizmaT"~ base, and the absorbance was read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. For suspension cells, the methodology was the same except that the assay was terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 NI of 80% TCA (final concentration, 16% TCA).   The growth inhibitory activity of ECO-4601 was measured by NCI utilizing the GlSO value, rather than the classical ICSO value. The GlSO value emphasizes the correction for the cell count at time zero and, using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Tz), control growth, (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)j, Gl5o is calculated as [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)j x 100 = -50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation. Result: ECO-4601 shows a significant antitumor activity against several types of tumor as revealed by the NCI screening. Results of the screen are shown in Table 16, and more detailed results of activity against gliomas are shown in Example 13 (Table 17).

EXAMPLE 13: IN VITRO ANTIPROLIFERATIVE STUDY AGAINST A PANEL OF      GLIOMA CELL LINES      The anticancer activity of ECO-4601 was evaluated using a panel of glioma cancer cell lines shown in Table 17, and the 50% inhibition of cell proliferation (ICSO) was determined. Culture conditions: The cell lines listed in Table 17 were shown to be free of mycoplasma infection and were maintained on DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin, under 5%  C02 at 37°C. Cells were passaged once a week. Prior to use the cells were detached from the culture flask by treating with trypsin for five to ten minutes. The cells were counted with a Neubauer glass slide and viability assessed by 0.25% trypan blue exclusion.  Only flasks with >95% cell viability, were used in the study. Cell lines amplification and plating: Cells, 5 x 103 cells per well in 100 NL  drug-free medium supplemented with 10% serum, were plated in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates and incubated at 37°C for 48 hrs before treatment. Evaluation of inhibitor~r activity on cell proliferation: Cells (in triplicate wells) were incubated 96 hrs with medium containing different concentrations of ECO-4601, starting at 5.0 Ng/ml (10 NM). The compound was used in a solution of 1 % DMSO in D-MEM  or RPMI media (or other equivalent media). The concentrations of ECO-4601 were as follows: 10 NM (5.0 Ng/ml), 1 NM (0.50 Ng/ml), 0.5 NM (0.25 Ng/ml), 0.1 NM  (0.050 Ng/ml), 0.5 NM (0.025 Ng/ml), 0.01 NM (0.0050 Ng/ml), 0.001 NM (0.00050 Ng/ml). Negative controls were cells treated with vehicle alone (1 % DMSO in culture medium). Positive controls were cells treated with 4 to 6 increasing concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP) (data not shown). The optical density was measured before incubation (time 0) and following 96 hrs of incubation with test compound in order to measure the growth rate of each cell line. At the end of the cell treatment, cell culture media was replaced with 150 NI  of fresh medium containing 10 mM of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.4. Then 50 NI of 2.5 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in PBS pH 7.4, were added to each well and the culture plates incubated for 4 hrs at 37°C. The resulting supernatant was removed and formazan crystals were dissolved with 200 NI of DMSO followed by 25 NI of glycine buffer (0.1 M glycine plus 0.1 M NaCI, pH 10.5). The optical density was read in each well using a single wavelength spectrophotometer plate reader at 570 nm.  Results were expressed as the concentration of drug, which inhibits 50% of the cell growth (ICSO). Each of the cell lines was tested in at least 3 independent experiments. Results shown in Table 17 confirmed the activity of ECO-4601 against different brain cancer cell lines including gliosarcoma, which is the most malignant form of type IV glioblastoma multiform. Gliosarcomas are a mixture of glial and endothelial cells and are resistant to any chemotherapy.

Animals: A total of 60 six-week-old female mice (Mus musculus nude mice), ranging between 18 to 25 g in weight, were observed for 7 days before treatment.  Animal experiments were performed according to ethical guidelines of animal experimentation (Charte du comite d'ethique du CNRS, juillet 2003) and the English guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia ( UVORKMAN, P., 71NENT'YMAN, P., BALKI~VILL, F., et al. ()998). United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) Guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia (Second Edition, July )997; British Journal of Cancer 77: )-)0). Any dead or apparently sick mice were promptly removed and replaced with healthy mice. Sick mice were euthanized upon removal from the cage. Animals were maintained in rooms under controlled conditions of temperature (2312°C), humidity (4515%), photoperiodicity (12 hrs light / 12 hrs dark) and air exchange. Animals were housed in polycarbonate cages (5/single cage) that were equipped to provide food and water. Animal bedding consisted of sterile wood shavings that were replaced every other day. Food was provided ad libitum, being placed in the metal lid on the top of the cage. Autoclaved tap water was provided ad libitum. Water bottles were equipped with rubber stoppers and sipper tubes. Water bottles were cleaned, sterilized and replaced once a week. Two different numbers engraved on two earrings identified the animals. Each cage was labelled with a specific code. Tumor Cell Line: The C6 cell line was cloned from a rat glial tumor induced by N-nitrosomethyurea (NMU) by Premont et al. (Premont J, Benda P, Jard S., ~3H] norepinephrine binding by rat glial cells in culture. Lack of correlation between binding and adenylate cyclase activation. Biochim Biophys Acta. )975 Feb )3;38)(2):368-76.) after series of alternate culture and animal passages. Cells were grown as adherent monolayers at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (5%  C02, 95% air). The culture medium was DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. For experimental use, tumor cells were detached from the culture flask by a 10 min treatment with trypsin-versen. The cells were counted in a hemocytometer and their viability assessed by 0.25% trypan blue exclusion. Preparation of the Test Article: For the test article, the following procedure was followed for reconstitution (performed immediately preceding injection). The vehicle consisted of a mixture of benzyl alcohol (1.5%), ethanol (8.5%), propylene glycol (27%), (27%), dimethylacetamide (6%) and water (30%). The vehicle solution was first vortexed in order to obtain a homogeneous liquid. 0.6 mL of the vortexed vehicle solution was added to each vial containing the test article (ECO-4601 ). Vials were mixed thoroughly by vortexing for 1 minute and inverted and shaken vigorously.  Vials were mixed again prior to injection into each animal. Animal Inoculation with tumor cells: Experiment started at day 0 (Do). On Do, mice received a superficial intramuscular injection of C6 tumor cells (5 x 105 cells) in 0.1 mL of DMEM complete medium into the upper right posterior leg. Treatment regimen and Results In a first series of experiments, treatment started 24 hrs following inoculation of C6 cells. On the day of the treatment, each mouse was slowly injected with 100 NL of test or control articles by i.p. route. For all groups, treatment was performed until the tumor volume of the saline-treated mice (group 1 ) reached approximately 3 cm3 (around day 16). Mice of group 1 were treated daily with a saline isosmotic solution for 16 days. Mice of group 2 were treated daily with the vehicle solution for 16 days. Mice of group 3 were treated daily with 10 mg/kg of ECO-4601 for 16 days. Mice of group 4 were treated every two days with 30 mg/kg of ECO-4601 and received 8 treatments.  Mice of group 5 were treated every three days with 30 mg/kg of ECO-4601 and received 6 treatments. Measurement of tumor volume started as soon as tumors became palpable (>100 mm3; day 11 post-inoculation) and was evaluated every second day until the end of the treatment using callipers. As shown in Table 18 and Figure 3, the mean value of the tumor volume of all ECO-4601 treated groups (6 mice/group) was significantly reduced as demonstrated by the one-way analysis of variance (Anova) test followed by the non-parametric Dunnett's multiple comparison test comparing treated groups to the saline group. An asterisk in the P value column of Table 18 indicates a statistically significant value, while "ns" signifies not significant.

Treatment was repeated daily for 5 consecutive days. On the day of the treatment, each mouse was slowly injected with 100 pL of ECO-4601 by i.p. route. Mice of group 1 were treated daily with saline isosmotic solution. Mice of group 2 were treated daily with the vehicle solution. Mice of group 3 were treated daily with 20 mg/kg of ECO-4601. Mice of group 4 were treated daily with 30 mg/kg of ECO-4601. Mice were treated until the tumor volume of the saline-treated control mice (group 1 ) reached around 4 cm3. Tumor volume was measured every second day until the end of the treatment using callipers. As shown in Table 19 and Figure 4, the mean value of the tumor volume of all ECO-4601 treated groups (6 mice/group) was significantly reduced as demonstrated by the one-way analysis of variance (Anova) test followed by the non-parametric Dunnett's multiple comparison test comparing treated groups to the saline group. An asterisk in the P value column of Table 19 indicates a statistically significant value, while "ns" signifies not significant.      Histological analysis of tumor sections showed pronounced morphological changes between ECO-4601-treated tumors and control groups. In tumors treated with ECO-4601 (20 - 30 mg/kg), cell density was decreased and the nuclei of remaining tumor cells appeared larger and pycnotic while no such changes were observed for vehicle-treated mice (Figure 5).

It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that slightly greater than one molecule equivalent of epoxidizing agent will result in the maximal yield of mono-epoxides, and that the reagent, solvent, concentration and temperature of the reaction will dictate the ratio of specific mono-epoxides formed. It will also be appreciated that the mono-epoxides will be enantiomeric mixtures, and that the di-epoxides and the tri-epoxide can be prepared as diastereomers and that the conditions of the reaction will determine the ratios of the products. One skilled in the art will appreciate that under most conditions of reactions the product will be a mixture of all possible epoxides and that these may be separated by standard methods of chromatography.
