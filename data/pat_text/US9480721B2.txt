 This application is a National Stage Application of International Application Number PCT/MY2010/000307, filed Nov. 29, 2010. 
 FIELD OF INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a use of metabolites obtained from Gram-positive bacteria such as Lactic acid bacteria as an anti-tumour agent. Indeed, the present invention also discloses methods for treating and/or preventing tumour growth on human cells. 
 BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 
 Lactic acid bacteria that existed widely in the natural world are microbes of generating an organic acid by using a carbohydrate such as a glucose or lactose (von Wright, 2005). The Lactic acid bacterium has been directly or indirectly used in food from a long time ago. As a result of a research on an intestinal microflora of a man, it has been reported that the main Lactic acid bacteria in the gastrointestinal track of a healthy man are  Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum  and so on. Such Lactic acid bacteria are resistant to gastric acid and bile (Balcazar, 2007). Presently, the Lactic acid bacterium has been widely used as a microbial agent or vital cell preparation of fermented goods and so on all over the world. There are many reports about the cytotoxic effect of fermented milk or Lactic acid bacteria on tumour cells. For example, the administration of  Lactobacillus casei  can prevent the development of colorectal cancer, with a daily intake of live  L. casei  suppressing atypia of colorectal tumours in 398 men and women who were free from tumours and who had at least two colorectal tumours removed (Ishikawa et al., 2005). Lactic acid bacteria are the bacteria metabolizing carbohydrate and producing lactic acid thereby. These bacteria belong to facultative anaerobes or obligatory anaerobes which proliferate well under anaerobic conditions. A few commonly known genuses of Lactic acid bacteria are  Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Bifidobacteria  and  Pediococcus . A  Streptococcus  genus microorganism is a homofermentative bacterium that generates lactic acid by fermenting milk to suppress putrefying bacteria or pathogenic bacteria. A  Lactobacillus  genus microorganism is a bacilliform, and a homo- or heterofermentative bacterium, which is widely seen in the fermentation of dairy products or vegetables. A  Leuconostoc  genus microorganism, a  diplococcus , is a heterofermentative bacterium and mostly involved in fermenting vegetables. A  Bifidobacteria  genus microorganism is an obligatory anaerobe which generates L(+) lactic acid useful for children's health, but it cannot survive under aerobic conditions (Holzapfel et al., 2001). 
 Many chemical compositions have been reported as an anti-tumour agent. However, these compositions not only destroy the tumour cells, but also destroy normal cells. Alternatively, surgical treatment is generally performed to remove tumour tissue. However, this could be difficult as this method does not remove the tumour tissues thoroughly. It is said that the actual condition of any therapy provides side effects and does not fully acquire the best results. For example, chemotherapy has been successfully used as neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and salvage strategies (Carlson et al., 2006). Chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cancer cells, with deleterious side effect to rapidly dividing normal cells. This results in the most common side effects of chemotherapy such as endothelial toxicity, immunosuppression, mucositis and alopecia (Mitchell, 2004; Mailloux et al., 2005). Moreover, the use of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs has been proved to cause chemoresistance in cancer cells (Zhivotovsky and Orrenius, 2009). It is also used as concomitant treatment therapy with irradiation and biological agents (American Cancer Society, 2009). Despite much more advance in chemotherapy to surgery and irradiation, cancer mortality rate still ranks high among causes of mortality in many countries (WHO, 2009a). It is therefore essential to develop novel chemotherapeutics with greater efficacy while limited toxicity to normal cells. 
 The desire by consumers to use natural methods for health maintenance rather than long-term chemotherapeutics agents linked to their expectation that food becomes a source of prolonged well-being, supports the speculation that the probiotic market will expand rapidly. Results obtained from multidisciplinary research will probably essential for the positioning of probiotic preparations as either a food, a food supplement or as pharmaceutical preparation (Mercenier et al., 2002). Bacteriocins are isolated from Lactic acid bacteria and they exhibit inhibitory effects against various pathogens in a manner similar to antibiotics. However, bacteriocins are distinguishable from antibiotics in terms of their synthesis, mode of action, toxicity and resistance mechanisms. 
 New antitumour compound are continually in demand, for the treatment of cancer in man and the production of new anticancer compounds is an important feature of developing antitumour agents for further studies. Equally important are novel strains of cultures used in the production processes for preparing these compounds. Additionally, it has been determined that the metabolites produced by certain microorganism exhibited antimicrobial activity against important human pathogenic bacteria and fungi, as well as having antiviral and anti-tumour activities (Zhao et al., 2006; Wachsman et al., 1999). 
 An object of the present invention is to provide a novel antitumour agent which has excellent antitumour activity based on metabolites with reduced side effects and which can be prepared starting with a highly safe bacterium used in food production. Yet, another objective of this present invention provides methods of measuring anticancer efficacy (cancer-cell-growth inhibition and apoptosis induction) of Lactic acid bacteria, and further to provide screening method of the Lactic acid bacteria which have anticancer efficacy.

Modifications and variations may be made to it without going away from neither the spirit nor the scope of the invention. Even though one may use other methods or products equivalent to those that we find hereinafter to test or to carry out the present invention, the material and the preferred methods are described. In the context of the present invention, in order to determine how the Lactic acid bacteria help in the apoptosis of cancer, trials have been conducted on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29, human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human liver cancer cell line Hep G2, human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K-562. The Lactic acid bacteria used constitute of  Lactobacillus plantarum  including I-UL4 (NRRL B67067), TL1 (NRRL B67068), RS5 (NRRL B67069), RG14 (NRRL B67071), RG11 (NRRL B67070) and RI11 (NRRL B67072) strains. Additionally, these strains produce metabolite/s which acts as an anti-tumour agent or cytotoxic agent. Yet, in this present invention, the anti-tumour agent or cytotoxic agent is supported by bacteriocins, nutrients, vitamin, salt of organic acids. 
 Preparing Metabolite 
 
   
 i) The metabolites of  Lactobacillus  sp. was transferred to fresh universal bottle and the pH of the metabolites was adjusted to physiological pH (between 7.2 and 7.4) using NaOH. The metabolites was filtered through 0.22 μm membrane syringe filter (Milipore, USA) prior to treatment on both cancerous cell lines and normal cells.
 
Obtaining Cell Line
 
 i) The Animal Tissue Culture Laboratory of Universiti Putra Malaysia provided the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29, human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human liver cancer cell line Hep G2, human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K-562. As for non-malignant normal glandular epithelium cells MCF-10A which was used as a model of normal glandular epithelium was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cancer and normal cell lines were maintained in the ATCC recommended medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated Foetal Bovine Serum and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated at 37° C. in 5% CO 2  atmosphere. 
 ii) All animal experiments were conducted adhering to the guidelines of Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia. The 7-8 weeks old male ICR mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The spleen and thymus obtained after dissection were rinsed 2-3 times with ice-cold PBS followed by mincing on a wire mesh soaked in PBS. The cell suspension was filtered using a wire mesh to remove any cell clumps. All the cells obtained were washed 2-3 times with ice-cold PBS by centrifugation (300×g for 5 min). 
 (ii) With the guideline and consent obtained from Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, about 10 ml of blood was drawn (venipuncture) aseptically from healthy human volunteers (25-30 years of age) and transferred to preservative free heparin tube. Anticoagulated blood was diluted with equal volume of pH 7.5 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and slowly layered over Ficoll-Paque Plus. The mixture was centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 400×g for 40 min at 18-20° C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from Ficoll-plasma interface and washed twice with PBS. The cells pellets of mice splenocytes, thymocytes and human PBMC were resuspended in complete growth media with density of 5×10 5  cells/ml.
 
Measures of Viability of Cancer Cells, Proliferation and Apoptosis Induction
 
 i) The effect of metabolites derived from six strains of locally isolated  Lactobacillus  sp. on cell viability was assessed using MTT assay according to Mosmann (1983). Cells were plated onto flat-bottomed 96-well plates at the density of 1×10 4  cells/well for 24 h prior to treatment [control cells, 0% (v/v) of metabolites] or in the presence of two-fold dilution of concentrations [50% (v/v) to 0.5% (v/v)] of metabolites. After 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of incubation respectively, 20 μl of MIT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated in the dark for 4 h at 37° C. and 5% CO 2  atmospheric condition. The resultant formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μl of DMSO. The absorbance (A) at 570 nm with reference wavelength of 630 nm was then recorded using μ Quant ELIZA reader (Biotek EL340, USA). Percentage of cell viability is calculated as (A sample −A blank )/(A control −A blank )×100%. All experiments were conducted in three independent experiments with triplicate samples for each experiment and the concentration of 50% inhibition (IC 50 ) values were determined.

 iii) Cells were seeded at 5×10 3  cells/well in 96-well plate. The medium was aspirated after 24 h and replaced with fresh medium containing the test extract to be studied for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. Further procedure was carried out according to protocol from manufacturer. Using a BrdU ELISA system as an alternative to the radioactive [ 3 H] thymidine incorporation assay, cells were reincubated with BrdU subsequently to a final concentration of 10 μM for 2-24 h. Medium was aspirated from each well. Fixative/denaturing solution was added to enable antibody binding to the incorporated BrdU where cells were fixed, permeabilized and the DNA denatured. Anti-BrdU antibody was added to every well and incubated for 1 h to bind to incorporated BrdU. Unbound antibody was then washed away and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse which binds to the detector antibody was added. Stop solution was added to each well before the colored reaction product is quantified by measuring the absorbance of each well at 450 nm ( reference wavelength  540 nm) using spectrophotometer (Biotek EL340, USA). 
 iv) One of the hallmarks of apoptotic cells is the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS). In principle, annexin V detects cell surface phosphatidylserine while PI stains cellular DNA of cells with compromised cell membranes. This allows the discrimination of viable cells (annexin V − /PI − ) from early apoptotic cells (annexin V + /PI − ) and late apoptotic and necrotic cells (annexin V + /PI + ). In this study, mode of cell death was examined using the BD Biosciences Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit. MCF-7 cells were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2.5×10 5  cells/well and allowed to attach overnight, followed by treatment for 24, 48 and 72 h. At the end of treatment, detached and trypsinised cells were pelleted down and resuspended in binding buffer. Cells were then stained with annexin V-FITC and PI for 15 min in the dark and diluted with binding buffer to a final volume of 500 μl before flow cytometry analysis. A total of 10,000 events per sample were acquired (Vermes et al., 1995). Data acquisition and analysis were performed on FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA). Results are expressed as the mean±SEM of at least three separate experiments. 
 v) MCF-7 cells were treated with UL4 (NRRL B67067) metabolite in six well plates and were incubated in 5% CO 2  atmospheric condition at 37° C. for 24, 48 and 72 hours. After 24, 48 and hours of incubation, respectively, detached cells in the medium were collected and added back to trypsinised adherent cells. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 10 μl of AO (100 μg/mL) and PI (100 μg/mL) at a ratio of 1:1 in 1 mL of cells and recentrifuged at 200×g for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated, leaving 50 μl of remnant supernatant. The pellet was resuspended and 10 μl of cell suspension was dripped on slide and covered with cover slip. Within 30 min, the slide was observed under fluorescent microscope (Nikon FC-35DX, Japan) with combination of excitation filter and barrier filter of 450-490 nm and long pass filter of 520 nm. The percentages of viable (green intact cells), apoptotic (green shrinking cells with condensed or fragmented nucleus), and late apoptotic and necrotic (red cells) were determined from >200 cells for the data to be statistically significant. 
 vi) Cells treated with UL4 (NRRL B67067) metabolite were harvested after incubation period of 24, 48 and 72 hours. The detached and trypsinised cells were pelleted and fixed with ice cold 80% ethanol drop by drop and incubate at 4° C. until analysis (minimum 2 hours). Then, the cell was pelleted again and washed with PBS-BSA-Az-EDTA buffer for twice. The cells were pulse-vortexed to elute the DNA fragments. For DNA analysis, cells were stained in PBS buffer consists of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 50 μg/mL RNase A and 2 μg/mL PI. This process was carried out in the dark because PI is sensitive to light. The cell was then incubated for 30 min at 4° C. and then read with FACS-Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) at Animal Tissue Culture Laboratory, Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University Putra Malaysia within 24 hours. Ten thousand events per samples were acquired. Doublets and cell debris were gated off in DNA dot plot view before calculation. Cell cycle distribution was calculated using CELLQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, USA). The experiment was repeated for at least three times with triplicated samples for each experiment.

 (vi) DNA labeling was carried out using BD Biosciences APO-DIRECT Kit. Cells were seeded at 2×10 5  cells/well in six-well tissue culture plate. After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the test extracts to be studied at the desired concentrations. Further procedure was done according to manufacturer's instructions. After incubation, the detached and trypsinised cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1-2×10 6  cells/mL. The cell suspension was placed on ice for 30-60 min. Fixed cells were then collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellets were washed twice in 5 mL of PBS and were resuspended in the residual PBS in tubes by gently vortexing. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in 70% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol and left for a minimum of 30 min on ice before being stored at −20° C. After appropriate storage time (1-7 days), the cell suspension was centrifuged at 300×g for 5 min and the 70% v/v ethanol was aspirated. The cells were washed with 1 mL of Wash Buffer twice and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the DNA Labeling Solution. 
 
 After incubation of 60 min, the cells were rinsed with 1 mL of Rinse Buffer twice and pelleted by centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min. The cell pellet was stained with 0.5 mL of the PI/RNase Staining Buffer. The cells were incubated in dark for 30 min at RT and analyzed by FACS-Calibur flow cytometry using CELLQuest Pro software within 3 hours. Ten thousand events per sample were acquired with the cell doublets and debris were gated off in DNA dot plot view before calculation. 
 Results were expressed as mean±S.E and analyzed by General Linear Model. The statistical analysis was conducted using Minitab Statistical Software at differences of P<0.05.
