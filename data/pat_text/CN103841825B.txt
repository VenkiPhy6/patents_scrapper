 Term " purified oil " refers to the extract oil with the impurity for reducing concentration compared with the impurity concentration in extract oil, institute
State impurity such as phospholipid, trace metal, free fatty, color compound, microcomponent oxidation product, volatility and/or smelly
Taste compound and sterol (such as ergosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, cholesterol).Purification process is not generally concentrated or is enriched with
Microbial oil so that special fatty acid is enriched with a large number, and therefore purified oil is non-concentrated in most cases. 
 Term " fraction containing lipid " and " SPD- purified oils " this paper used interchangeablies.These terms refer to the microorganism of extraction
Oil, which includes the TAG- fractions with one or more PUFA, and the oil has undergone distillating method at least under the conditions of SPD
It is secondary.If sterol fraction is present in extract oil, compared with the sterol content in oil before short-path distillation, distillating method is reduced and is contained
Sterol amount in lipid fraction. 
 Although SPD can concentrate ethyl ester, methyl ester and free fatty, the method does not generally concentrate TAG and (for example, removes
Non- to run under thermal extremes, this subsequently results in TAG decomposition).Because the most of PUFA in fraction containing lipid is TAG forms,
And SPD methods generally do not concentrate TAG so that specific fatty acid is enriched with a large number, with regard to purpose described herein in most cases
Think that fraction containing lipid is non-concentrated. 
 Term " ester exchange " is referred to by the chemical reaction of acid or base catalyst catalysis, wherein a kind of fatty acid ester is changed into
