 Based on the above results, the expression of at least one malonyl--CoA synthase in the restructuring Yarrowia lipolytica strain of the optimization improved, as the generation reducing unwanted by product and thus to reduce the means of production cost be desirably.Preferred malonyl--CoA synthase is as shown in SEQ ID NO:40 and 42, but these should not be construed as limiting the disclosure.Those skilled in the art easily identification can be applicable to the substituting allos malonyl--CoA synthase of the expression in Yarrowia lipolytica. 
 Glyceryl phosphatide is the main ingredient of biological enzyme, and it comprises glycerine core, and on the sn-1 position that lipid acid is connected to glycerine core as R base and sn-2 position, and polar head group is connected on sn-3 position by phosphodiester bond.Table 5 below outlines the step of the from the beginning biosynthetic pathway described by Kennedy and Weiss (J.Biol.Chem., 222:193-214 (1956)) at first: 
 
 table 5: glyceryl phosphatide is biosynthetic General reactions from the beginning 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After by de novo synthesis, glyceryl phosphatide can experience the quick upset of the fatty acyl composition of sn-2 position.This " reconstruct ", or " acyl group editor ", the de-acyl reaction being considered to glyceryl phosphatide and the lysophospholipid that obtains subsequently again caused by acidylate. 
 In Lands circulation (Lands, W.E., J.Biol.Chem., 231:883-888 (1958)), reconstruct and occurred by following collaborative reaction: 1) Phospholipid hydrolase, such as phospholipase A
         2 , from the sn-2 position release fat acid of phosphatidylcholine; With, 2) Acyl-coenzyme A: lysophospholipid acyltransferase [" LPLAT "], such as lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase [" LPCAT "], make lyso-phosphatidylcholine [" LPC "] in sn-2 position acidylate again.Other glyceryl phosphatide also can relate to reconstruct under their corresponding lysophospholipid acyltransferase active functions, comprises and has the LPLAT enzyme that haemolysis phosphoric acid acyl thanomin acyltransferase [" LPEAT "] is active, hemolytic phosphatidylserine acyltransferase [" LPSAT "] is active, lysophosphatidyl glycerol acyltransferase [" LPGAT "] is active and LPI acyltransferase [" LPIAT "] is active.In all cases, LPLAT is responsible for from the Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse of cell, remove Acyl-coenzyme A lipid acid and the multiple lysophospholipid substrate in Acylated phosphatide storehouse, sn-2 position.Finally, LPLAT also comprises the from the beginning biosynthetic LPAAT enzyme related to from LPA to PA.
       
 In the other cases, the reconstruct of this sn-2 position is considered to forward and caused (Stymne S. and A.K.Stobart of backward reaction of the enzyme with LPCAT activity, Biochem J., 223 (2): 305-314 (1984)). 
 The nearest several sections of summaries of the people such as Shindou provide general introduction (J.Biol.Chem., 284 (1): 1-5 (2009) of the function to glyceryl phosphatide biosynthesizing and LPLAT; J.Lipid Res., 50:S46-S51 (2009)).Further, based on the existence of conserved motifs, in open source literature and patent documentation, multiple LPLAT has been reported. 
 More particularly, having proposed multiple LPLAT motif, there is a small amount of variation according to specific species included in analyzed comparison in them.Such as, the people such as Shindou (Biochem.Biophys.Res.Comm., 383:320-325 (2009)) based on to from the mankind (Homo sapiens), Hongyuan chicken (Gallus gallus), the comparison of the sequence of zebra fish (Danio rerio) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Caenorhabditiselegans), propose the following film important to LPLAT activity in conjunction with O-acyltransferase [" MBOAT "] family's motif: WD, WHGxxxGYxxxF (SEQ ID NO:99), YxxxxF (SEQ ID NO:100) and YxxxYFxxH (SEQ ID NO:101).Among these, WD, WHGxxxGYxxxF and YxxxxF motif is present in ScAle (SEQ ID NO:15) and YlAle1 (SEQ ID NO:17), but YxxxYFxxH motif is not.With regard to Ale1 homologue, substituting non-plant motif is also described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008-0145867-A1; Specifically, these comprise: M-[V/I]-[L/I]-xxK-[L/V/I]-xxxxxxDG (SEQ ID NO:102), RxKYYxxWxxx-[E/D]-[A/G] xxxxGxG-[F/Y]-xG (SEQ ID NO:103), EX

         2 w (SEQ ID NO:21) and SAxWHGxxPGYxx-[T/F]-F (SEQID NO:104).
       
 Similarly, Lewin, T.W. people (Biochemistry is waited, people (the Biochim.Biophys.Acta such as 38:5764-5771 (1999) and Yamashita, 1771:1202-1215 (2007)) based on to from bacterium, yeast, the comparison of nematode and mammiferous sequence, propose following to active important 1-acyl group-sn-GPAT [" LPAAT "] family's motif: the NHxxxxD (SEQ ID NO:33) of LPLAT, GxxFI-[D/R]-R (SEQ ID NO:105), one of both EGTR (SEQ ID NO:34) and [V/I]-[P/X]-[I/V/L]-[I/V]-P-[V/I] (SEQ ID NO:106) and IVPIVM (SEQ IDNO:107).Above-mentioned NHxxxxD and EGTR motif is present in MaLPAAT1 (SEQ IDNO:29), YlLPAAT1 (SEQ ID NO:31) and CeLPCAT (SEQ ID NO:25), but other motifs are not. 
 Based on Ale1, LPCAT and LPAAT protein sequence that can openly obtain, comprise described herein those, for the LPLAT that is included in the restructuring Yarrowia lipolytica strain of the optimization improved herein or have and be selected from M (V/I) LxxKL (SEQ ID NO:18), RxKYYxxW (SEQ IDNO:19), SAxWHG (SEQ ID NO:20) and EX
         11 wNX
         2 -[T/V]-X
         2 the MBOAT family motif of W (SEQ ID NO:21), or there is the 1-acyl group-sn-GPAT family motif being selected from NHxxxxD (SEQ ID NO:33) and EGTR (SEQ ID NO:34).
       
 Biosynthesizing due to lipid acid needs the rapid exchange of carboxyl groups between Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse and phosphatide storehouse, and LPLAT is also conceived on the impact that PUFA produces.Specifically, desaturation mainly occurs in the sn-2 position of phosphatide, and extends in Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse and occur. 
 More particularly, LPCAT may be important (U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006-0115881-A1) by hypothesis for the accumulation of EPA in the TAG part of Yarrowia lipolytica before this.As described in this document, this hypothesis is based on following research: 1) Stymne S. and A.K.Stobart (Biochem.J., 223 (2): 305-314 (1984)) exchange that, they suppose between Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse and PC storehouse may be forward due to LPCAT and backward reaction; 2) Domergue, F. people (J.Bio.Chem. is waited, 278:35115 (2003)), they propose GLA ARA in the accumulation and yeast of the sn-2 position of PC can not be because relate to the biosynthetic extension step of PUFA and occur in Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse by synthesis effectively, and Δ 5 and Δ 6 desaturation step mainly occur in the sn-2 position of PC; 3) Abbadi, A. people (The Plant Cell is waited, 16:2734-2748 (2004)), they according in transgenosis oil seed plant to the analysis of PUFA accumulation restriction, propose LPCAT and extend at Δ 6 desaturases/Δ 6 in the successful reconstruct of enzymatic pathway and play keying action; With 4) work of people in international application published WO 2004/076617A2 and WO 2004/087902 A2 such as Renz, A.. 
 More particularly, international application published WO 2004/076617 A2 describes the separation of a kind of LPCAT from Caenorhabditis elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) (clone T06E8.1) [" CeLPCAT "], and reports when this LPCAT is using 18:2 or the alpha-linolenic acid [" ALA " of external source respectively; 18:3] lipid acid raise through biotechnology transformation Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) bacterial strain in express time, the raising of the efficiency that Δ 6 desaturation and Δ 6 extend, and EDA [" EDA "; 20:2] and eicosatetraenoic acid [" ETA "; 20:4] biosynthesizing improve respectively. 
 International application published WO 2004/087902 A2 (embodiment 16) describes Mortierella alpina (Mortierella alpina) LPAAT-sample protein (respectively by the protein coding with 417 amino acid lengths or 389 amino acid lengths, they are identical except the extension that N holds 28 amino-acid residues) separation, and report the utilization of one of these protein and the expression of those the similar methods in international application published WO2004/076617 A2, express and result in the biosynthetic similar improvement of EDA and ETA. 
 The biosynthetic improvement that international application published WO 2004/076617 and WO 2004/087902 teaches EDA and ETA is because LPCAT reversible in CeLPLAT and some LPAAT-sample protein is active, although not every LPAAT-sample protein all has LPCAT activity.In addition; Renz; A. people is waited to infer; the exchange that LPCAT allows the lipid acid of new synthesis effective and lasting between phosphatide and Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse, because desaturase catalysis double bond extends the extension of the lipid acid (Acyl-coenzyme A) of enzyme ad hoc catalysis coenzyme A esterification to the introducing in the lipid acid of PC-coupling. 
 The coexpression that many parts of other reference generally describe LPLAT and PUFA biosynthesis gene for improve in the oil of genetically modified organism desired lipid acid amount, improve total oil-contg or optionally improve the beneficial effect (such as, international application published WO 2006/069936, WO 2006/052870, WO 2009/001315, WO2009/014140) of content of desired lipid acid. 
 Herein (and in the U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/187359 of the common submission of the transferee of applicant, this patent is filed on June 16th, 2009, attorney docket is CL4361USPRV, is incorporated in full herein with way of reference) demonstrate important really for the accumulation of EPA in the TAG part of Yarrowia lipolytica of LPAAT and LPCAT.Specifically, found that the process LAN of LPLAT can cause Δ 9 to extend the improvement of enzymatic conversion efficiency.As hereinbefore defined, term " transformation efficiency " refers to that specific enzyme such as Δ 9 extends the efficiency that substrate (such as LA) can be converted into product (such as EDA) by enzyme.Therefore, passing through transformation to produce in the bacterial strain of EPA, the improvement that Δ 9 extends enzymatic conversion efficiency is proved to be the raising causing EPA%TFA and/or EPA%DCW.

 As for those skilled in the art by apparent, use method as herein described can the numerous production of through engineering approaches at least about the Ye Shi yeast strain of the optimization of 50EPA%TFA.Therefore, with regard to commercial purpose, the selection of preferred bacterial strain also will will consider the total lipid content of the bacterial strain of through engineering approaches, because the EPA concentration [" EPA%TFA "] of the percentages by total fatty acids and total lipid content [" TFA%DCW "] all affect the cell EPA content [" EPA%DCW "] by dry cell wt.That is, EPA%DCW is calculated as: (EPA%TFA) * (TFA%DCW)]/100.Such as, produce 50EPA%TFA and have 24TFA%DCW bacterial strain, produce 55EPA%TFA and have 21.82TFA%DCW bacterial strain, produce 60EPA%TFA and have 20TFA%DCW bacterial strain, produce 65EPA%TFA and there is the bacterial strain of 18.46TFA%DCW and produce 70EPA%TFA and the bacterial strain with 17.14TFA%DCW all produces 12EPA%DCW.In preferred embodiments, the Yarrowia lipolytica strain of the optimization of described improvement will be produced at least about 10-12EPA%DCW, preferably at least about 12-14EPA%DCW, more preferably at least about 14-16EPA%DCW, more preferably at least about 16-18EPA%DCW, more preferably at least about 18-20EPA%DCW, more preferably at least about 20-22EPA%DCW, more preferably at least about 22-24EPA%DCW, and most preferably at least about 24-26EPA%DCW. 
 Except having at least about except 50EPA%TFA, in the Yarrowia lipolytica strain of the optimization of described improvement or from its extraction or lipodogramme in unconcentrated oil by have at least about 3.1 EPA%TFA to LA%TFA ratio.As in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009-0093543-A1 (table 23) show, EPA, LA and oleic acid constitute to produce and are greater than about 76-80% of the lipid acid existed in the lipodogramme of the Yarrowia lipolytica strain of 40EPA%TFA.Wherein, LA%TFA is approximately high than oleic acid %TFA three times.Observe based on these, those skilled in the art will know, make the concentration of intermediate fatty acid LA minimize (cause improve EPA: LA ratio), be " pushed " causing more carbon by PUFA biosynthetic pathway and allow the EPA synthesis that improves.In preferred embodiments, the ratio of EPA: LA will be at least about 3.1-3.5, more preferably at least about 3.5-4.5, more preferably at least about 4.5-5.5, and most preferably at least about 5.5-6.5. 
 The lipid produced by the restructuring Yarrowia lipolytica strain of the optimization of improvement as herein described also will have following characteristics: when by having GLA or DHA (described GC analyzes the equipment using and have the detection level being low to moderate about 0.1%) that be less than about 0.5% during GC analysis to measure and having the saturated fatty acid content being less than about 8%.The saturated fatty acid (that is, 16:0 and 18:0) of this low per-cent causes the healthy and helpful effect tangible to humans and animals. 
 Microbial Expression Systems and the expression vector of the regulating and controlling sequence containing guiding extraneous protein high level expression are well known to those skilled in the art.Any these can be used to the mosaic gene building the preferred desaturase of coding, extension enzyme, CPT1, DGLA synthase, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase protein.Then can use standard transformation methods that these mosaic genes are imported Yarrowia lipolytica to provide the enzyme coded by high level expression. 
 The carrier (as construct, plasmid) and the DNA expression cassette that can be used for transformed Yarrowia sp host cell are well known in the art.The character of required expression product, host cell and the means being separated transformant relative to no transformed cells of proposition are depended in the concrete selection being present in the sequence in construct.But usual carrier contains the sequence of at least one expression cassette, selective marker and permission self-replicating or chromosomal integration.Suitable expression cassette comprises the DNA fragmentation 3 ' district (as terminator) of the 5th ' district (as promotor) of Gene Handling transcription initiation, gene coded sequence and control Transcription Termination usually.Most preferably when 2 control regions all derive from the gene of inverting host cell, although they are natural genes (such as Yarrowia lipolytica) without the need to deriving from production host. 
 If two or more genes are expressed from independently replicating vector, then wish each carrier there is different selection approaches and should lack and the homology of other construct to maintain stably express and to prevent element reprovision (reassortment) between construct.Available experimental method is determined control region, selection approach and the selecting properly of the enrichment procedure of construct introduced, so that the gene of all importings all provides the synthesis of desired product with the horizontal expression needed. 
 Construct or carrier comprise concerned gene, are imported host cell as Ye Shi Saccharomyces cell by any standard technique.These technology comprise conversion (such as, lithium acetate transformation [Methods inEnzymology, 194:186-187 (1991)]), biolistic bombardment (bolistic impact), electroporation, microinjection or by any other method in paid close attention to channel genes host cell.Herein for integration technology that the preferred method of Yarrowia lipolytica is based on DNA linear fragment, as United States Patent (USP) 4,880,741 and United States Patent (USP) 5,071, in 764 and described in the people (Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol., 48 (2): 232-235 (1997)) such as Chen, D..C.. 
 For simplicity, handle the host cell absorbing DNA sequence dna (as expression cassette) by any method and be referred to herein as " conversion ", " transformant " or " recombinant chou ".The host transformed will have expression cassette of at least one copy, and can have two or more copies, this depend on this expression cassette be integrated in genome or be present in there is multiple copied number extra-chromosomal element on.The host cell transformed can be identified by multiple choices technology, as United States Patent (USP) 7, and 238,482 and United States Patent (USP) 7,259, described in 255. 
 Method for preferential selection for this paper is to kantlex, Totomycin and aminoglycoside G418 resistance and is lacking the ability that the substratum of uridylic, leucine, Methionin, tryptophane or Histidine grows.In an alternate embodiment, 5-fluororotic acid (5 FU 5 fluorouracil-6-carboxylic acid monohydrate; " 5-FOA ") can be used for selecting yeast Ura-mutant (U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009-0093543-A1), or give natural acetohydroxy acid synthase (or the acetolactate synthase of sulfonylurea antiweed (international application published WO 2006/052870); E.C.4.1.3.18) be used to carry out the selection to transformant.Utilize a unique method for site-specific recombinase system, " recycling " a pair preferred selective marker is used for repeatedly transforming continuously, also teach that the method in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009-0093543-A1. 
 As well known for one of skill in the art, only gene (such as desaturase, extension enzyme, CPT1, DGLA synthase, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase) is inserted cloning vector and do not guarantee that it can with expression such as desired rate, concentration, amounts.Handle that much control is transcribed, rna stability, translation, protein stability and protein position, oxygen restriction and may be desirably from the different genetic elements of the secretion of host cell.More particularly, by change following come the expression of controlling gene: the character of relevant transcriptional promoter and terminator sequence; The copy number of institute's clone gene; This gene is that plasmid carries or has been integrated in the genome of host cell; The final cell location of synthesized exogenous protein; The translation of protein in host living beings and correct folding efficiency; The protein of institute's clone gene in host cell in stability; Use with the codon in institute clone gene, to make the preferred codon usage frequency of its frequency and host cell close.Afternoon is several by what discuss in these process LAN methods, and they are useful as process LAN such as desaturase, the method that extends enzyme, CPT1 protein, DGLA synthase, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase in restructuring Ye Shi yeast host cell. 
 Increase by using stronger promotor (regulation type or composing type) to cause and expressing, by removing/deleting stabilization removal sequence or by critical sequences being added to mRNA (United States Patent (USP) 4 from mRNA or proteins encoded, 910,141), on, the expression of required gene can be improved on transcriptional level. 
 Can be used for driving the transcription initiation control region of heterologous gene or the expression of its part in Ye Shi yeast belong host cell or promotor to have a lot, and known to those skilled in the art.Expression can complete with induction type or composing type.The activity that inducible expression may be operably coupled to the regulatable promoter of paid close attention to gene by induction has been come, and constitutive expression realizes by utilizing the constitutive promoter that may be operably coupled to paid close attention to gene.Almost any can instruct in Ye Shi yeast desaturase, extend enzyme, CPT1, DGLA synthase, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase gene expression promotor (namely; natural, synthesis or chimeric) will be all applicable, although be particularly useful with translational domain from transcribing of this host species. 
 Terminator usually can come from the gene that initiator obtains from it 3rd ' district or from different genes.A large amount of terminators is known and (when the identical and different genus for being derived from from them and species) function of playing in multiple host is satisfactory.The selection of terminator is usually is mostly conveniently instead of because any special character.Preferably, terminator derives from yeast genes.3 '-district also can be synthesis, because those skilled in the art can utilize obtainable information to design and synthesize 3 '-region sequence as transcription terminator.Termination site can be nonessential, but is highly preferred. 
 Although be not intended to be construed as limiting, preferred promoter region useful in the disclosure and terminator are those of instructing in U.S. Patent Publication 2009-0093543-A1. 
 The desaturase of PUFA biosynthetic pathway, the additional copy (i.e. more than one copy) extending enzyme and DGLA synthase gene and/or CPT1, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase gene can be imported into Yarrowia lipolytica to improve production and the accumulation of EPA thus.Specifically, other gene copy can be cloned in single expression construct; And/or the other copy of clone gene can by increasing plasmid copy number or importing (hereafter) in host cell by being repeatedly integrated into by clone gene in genome. 
 The important point that should be noted is; when the Yarrowia lipolytica strain optimized according to method preparation herein, the copy number of multiple desaturase, extension enzyme, CPT1, DGLA synthase, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase is often mentioned.If such as need the Δ 9 of 2 copies to extend enzyme, this can refer to: the specific Δ 9 1) be separated from single species extends two copies of the same-code sequence of enzyme; Or, 2) Δ 9 that is separated from species " A " encoding sequence extending enzyme and the Δ 9 be separated from species " B " extend an encoding sequence of enzyme, and so altogether obtain two kinds of Δs 9 and extend enzyme. 
 In general, once obtain the DNA box (such as comprising the mosaic gene of promotor, ORF and terminator) being applicable to express in saccharomyces olei, then be placed on can in host cell self-replicating plasmid vector in, or it to be directly integrated in the genome of host cell.The integration of expression cassette can occur randomly or can carry out target by using such construct in host genome, namely this construct contain the restructuring be enough in target host gene seat with the district of host genome homology.Although do not rely on herein, if construct target endogenous gene seat, then transcribe and can be provided by endogenous gene seat with the whole of translational control district or some. 
 In Yarrowia lipolytica, the preferred method of expressing gene is by being incorporated in host genome by linear DNA fragment.When expecting high level gene expression, the multiple positions be incorporated in genome can be that the preferred locus be particularly useful comprises those of instructing in U.S. Patent Publication 2009-0093543-A1. 
 (stability of the DNA integration fragment that Yeast, 18:97-113 (2001) propose in Yarrowia lipolytica depends on single transformant, F-strain and target platform used to the people such as Juretzek.Therefore, technician must screen multiple transformant to obtain the bacterial strain of the required expression level of display and type by recognizing.This type of screening can analyze (Southern by the Southern of southern blotting technique, J.Mol.Biol., 98:503 (1975)), the Northern of mrna expression analyzes (Kroczek, J.Chromatogr.Biomed.Appl., 618 (1-2): 133-145 (1993)), the Western of protein expression analyzes, the phenotype analytical of PUFA product or GC analyze. 
 The microbial host cell of conversion is grown in such a situa-tion: make the expression optimization of mosaic gene (desaturase of such as, encoding, extend enzyme, CPT1, DGLA synthase, malonyl--CoA synthase and Acyl-coenzyme A lysophospholipid acyltransferase) and produce high and the most most economical EPA output.Usually, by changing the type of carbon source and amount, the type of nitrogenous source and amount, carbon-nitrogen ratio, the amount of different minerals ion, oxygen level, growth temperature, pH, the duration of biomass production phases, the duration of oil accumulation phase and the time of cell harvesting and method Optimal Medium condition.Yarrowia lipolytica usually grows at complex medium (as yeast extract-peptone-dextrose broth [" YPD "]) or lacks the necessary composition of growth and force thus in the minimum medium of the determination composition selecting required expression cassette (as Yeast Nitrogen Base (DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI)). 
 Fermention medium for methods described herein and host cell must comprise suitable carbon source, as at United States Patent (USP) 7,238,482 and U.S. Patent application 12/641,929 (being filed on December 19th, 2009) in the carbon source that proposes.Although the carbon source utilized in expection the present invention can contain many kinds of carbonaceous sources, preferred carbon source is carbohydrate, glycerine and/or lipid acid.Most preferably glucose, sucrose, invert sucrose, fructose and/or comprise the lipid acid of the carbon atom between 10-22.Such as, fermentable carbon source can be selected from invert sucrose, glucose, fructose and these combination, and prerequisite is glucose and invert sucrose and/or fructose conbined usage.

 Lipid acid [" FA "] is analyzed, by cell by collected by centrifugation and as Bligh, E.G. & Dyer, W.J. (Can.J.Biochem.Physiol., 37:911-917 (1959)) described extraction lipid.By lipid-soluble extract and sodium methylate are carried out transesterification reaction and prepare fatty acid methyl ester [" FAME "] (Roughan, G. with Nishida I., Arch Biochem Biophys., 276th volume, 1st phase, 38-46 page (1990)) and subsequently it is analyzed with Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) being furnished with 30m × 0.25mm (internal diameter) HP-INNOWAX (Hewlett-Packard) post.Furnace temperature rises to 185 DEG C with 3.5 DEG C/min from 170 DEG C (keeping 25 minutes). 
 In order to carry out direct base-catalyzed transesterification reaction, collecting Ye Shi yeast cell (0.5mL culture), washing once in distilled water, and in Speed-Vac dry 5-10 minute under vacuo.By the C15:0 triacylglycerol (C15:0TAG of sodium methylate (100 μ l, concentration is 1%) and known quantity; Catalog number (Cat.No.) T-145, Nu-Check Prep, Elysian, MN) add in sample, then by sample vortex, vibrate 30 minutes at temperature is 50 DEG C.After adding 3 1M sodium-chlor and 400 μ l hexanes, vortex Centrifuge A sample.Remove upper strata and analyze with GC. 
 The retention time of FAME peak value when comparing with known lipid acid by them via GC analytic record is identified, and is undertaken quantitatively by the peak area of the internal controls (C15:0TAG) comparing FAME and known quantity.Therefore, any fatty acid F AME [" μ g FAME "] of approximate quantity (μ g) is calculated: (specifying the FAME peak area/standard substance FAME peak area of lipid acid) * (μ g standard substance C15:0TAG) according to following formula, any lipid acid [" μ g FA "] of a certain amount of (μ g) is calculated: (specifying the FAME peak area/standard substance FAME peak area of lipid acid) * (μ g standard substance C15:0TAG) * 0.9503, because 1 μ g C15:0TAG equals 0.9503 μ g lipid acid according to following formula.Attention: the conversion factor of 0.9503 is the approximation of most of determination of fatty acid, its scope is between 0.95 and 0.96. 
 The lipid characteristic summarizing the amount that often kind of single lipid acid represents with TFA % by weight is by being multiplied by 100 with single FAME peak area calculating divided by the sum of all FAME peak areas.

 Table 27 summarizes and to work in PUFA biosynthetic pathway and often kind of desaturase needed for the production of EPA and Δ 9 extend the transformation efficiency of enzyme.Specifically, for often kind of Y8406 control strain and Y8406U transformant bacterial strain, provide Δ 12 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 12CE "], Δ 8 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 8CE "], Δ 5 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 5CE "], Δ 17 desaturase transformation efficiency [" Δ 17CE "] and Δ 9 and extend transformation efficiency [" Δ 9e CE "]; The data of often kind of Y8406U transformant are shown as the per-cent accounting for Y8406 contrast.Transformation efficiency calculates according to following formula: product/(product+substrate) * 100, wherein product had both comprised product and also comprised product derivative. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Based in table 26 and 27 about experiment 1, the data of 2 and 3, LPLAT is at EPA bacterial strain Y8406U::ScAle1S-5, Y8406U::ScAle1S-11, process LAN in Y8406U::YlAle1 and Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S result in the remarkable reduction of the LA of account for TFA % by weight (18:2) concentration [" LA%TFA "] (reaching 67% or lower of contrast), in account for TFA % by weight the rising (reaching at least 12% of contrast) of EPA concentration [" EPA%TFA "], the rising (reaching at least 16% of contrast) of enzymatic conversion efficiency is extended with Δ 9.As compared to Y8406U::ScAle1S-5 with Y8406U::ScAle1S-11, Y8406U::YlAle1 has lower LA%TFA, higher EPA%TFA, better Δ 9 and extends enzymatic conversion efficiency and lower slightly TFA%DCW and EPA%DCW.Process LAN except MaLPAAT1S result in except lower LA%TFA, EPA%TFA and EPA%DCW, Y8406U::YlAle1 with Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S is similar. 
 Experiment 4 display, the process LAN of LPLAT in EPA bacterial strain Y8406U::YlAle1, Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S and Y8406U::CeLPCATS result in the rising (reaching at least 13% of contrast) that the remarkable reduction (reaching 67% or lower of contrast) of LA%TFA, the rising (reaching at least 9% of contrast) of EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency.Compared with Y8406U::CeLPCATS, the TFA%DCW that Y8406U::YlLPAAT1 and Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S all has lower LA%TFA, higher EPA%TFA, higher EPA%DCW and omited.Process LAN except MaLPAAT1S result in lower LA%TFA, lower slightly EPA%TFA and EPA%DCW and lower slightly Δ 9 extends except enzymatic conversion efficiency, Y8406U::YlLPAAT1 with Y8406U::MaLPAAT1S is similar. 
 Be well known in the art, most of desaturation occurs on the sn-2 position of phosphatide, and lipid acid extension occurs on Acyl-coenzyme A.In addition, expection ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S and YlLPAAT1 only make carboxyl groups mix lysophospholipid from Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse, the such as sn-2 position of Ultrapole L [" LPA "] and lyso-phosphatidylcholine [" LPC "].Therefore, the phospholipid substrate operability owing to improving is caused desat raising by the expression of expection ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S and YlLPAAT1, and does not cause the raising of the extension needing the substrate availability improved in coenzyme A storehouse.Our data (see above) display, unexpectedly, ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S and YlLPAAT1 expression produce EPA Ye Shi yeast strain in significantly improve Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency but not improve (with Δ 12 desaturase transformation efficiency, Δ 8 desaturase transformation efficiency, Δ 5 desaturase transformation efficiency or Δ 17 desaturase transformation efficiency measure) desaturation. 
 CeLPCAT has been displayed on before this in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae of LA or GLA that feed and has improved Δ 6 and extend transformation efficiency (international application published WO 2004/076617).This reversible LPCAT making lipid acid be released into coenzyme A storehouse from phosphatide owing to it is active.In international application published WO 2004/076617, and inexpectancy was carrying out genetic engineering modified oil-containing microorganism as in Yarrowia lipolytica for the high-level LC-PUFA production in lipid acid situation of not feeding, and Δ 9 extends the improvement of transformation efficiency. 
 In addition, in the Ye Shi yeast strain producing EPA, the expression of ScAle1S, YlAle1, MaLPAAT1S, YlLPAAT1 and CeLPCATS does not significantly change accumulated PUFA level or total lipid content. 
 Research formerly shows, because between phosphatide and Acyl-coenzyme A storehouse, the transfer of carboxyl groups is bad, Δ 6 extends and Δ 9 to extend be all bottleneck in long-chain PUFA biosynthesizing.The Δ 9 caused based on the process LAN of LPCAT shown above extends the raising of enzymatic conversion efficiency, expects that LPCAT as herein described and their ortholog thing are as ScLPAAT, will improve Δ 6 equally and extend transformation efficiency.

 the function of different LPAAT in the Yarrowia lipolytica strain Y8406 producing EPA characterizes 
 
 The Yarrowia lipolytica strain Y8406U producing EPA is used to the effect not having the expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae LPAATS (SEQ ID NO:151) and the Yarrowia lipolytica LPAAT1 (SEQ ID NO:30) integrated functionally be characterized on autonomously replicating plasmid.The host of this LPAAT natural with comprising it constitutes and compares. 
 
 transform and growth 
 
 Transform respectively with the uncut plasmid from embodiment 10 and understand fat Ye Shi yeast strain Y8406U (embodiment 9).Specifically, carrier pY177 (YAT1::YlLPAAT1::Lip1) [SEQ ID NO:156] and pY222 (YAT1::ScLPAATS::Lip1) [SEQ ID NO:153] has been transformed according to " general method ". 
 Often kind of transformation mixture is laid down on MM agar plate.Several URA+ transformant obtained of picking, and be seeded to 3mL CSM-U substratum (Teknova catalog number (Cat.No.) C8140, Teknova Inc., Hollister, CA) in, wherein CSM-U substratum refers to the CM meat soup deducting uridylic containing glucose, comprises 0.13% amino acid and saves component powders and subtract uridylic, 0.17% yeast nitrogen, 0.5% (NH
         4 )
         2 sO
         4 , and 2.0% glucose.Wobbler, by collected by centrifugation culture, and is resuspended in 3mL HGM substratum (catalog number (Cat.No.) 2G2080, Teknova Inc.) after 2 days with 200rpm and 30 DEG C of growth.After wobbler grows 5 days, collect the 1mL aliquots containig of above-mentioned culture and analyzed by GC, as described in example 9 above.
       
 Lipid acid based on described 3mL culture forms, and characterizes the transformant through selecting further by flask detection method.Specifically, have selected clone #5 and #6 of the bacterial strain Y8406U transformed with expression vector pY222 (comprising ScLPAATS), and difference called after " Y8406U::ScLPAATS-5 " and " Y8406U::ScLPAATS-6 "; Have selected the clone #1 of the bacterial strain Y8406U transformed with expression vector pY177 (comprising YlLPAAT1), and called after " Y8406U::YlLPAAT1 ". 
 In addition, bacterial strain Y8406 (the Ura+ bacterial strain as the parent of bacterial strain Y8406U (Ura-)) is used as contrast. 
 Often kind of transformant through selection and contrast are rule on MM agar plate.Then, the cell of the fresh line of a transfering loop is seeded to 3mL CSM-U substratum, and in 30 DEG C with 250rpm overnight incubation.Measure OD
         600nm , in 125mL flask, add the cell of an aliquots containig, make OD final in 25mL CSM-U substratum
         600nm be 0.3.Cultivate 2 days with 250rpm in 30 DEG C of shaking culture casees after, by collected by centrifugation 6mL culture, and be resuspended in 25mL HGM in 125mL flask.After cultivating 5 days with 250rpm in 30 DEG C of shaking culture casees, use 1mL aliquots containig to carry out GC analysis (see above), and dry 10mL is used for dry cell wt [" DCW "] mensuration, as described in example 9 above.
       
 
 lipid content, lipid acid composition and transformation efficiency 
 
 For 2 cultures [" repeat samples "] repeated of Y8406 control strain and Y8406U transformant bacterial strain, the per-cent that accounts for DCW to lipid content, lipid acid composition and EPA carries out quantitatively.In addition, the data of often kind of Y8406U transformant are also shown as the per-cent accounting for Y8406 contrast.The total lipid content [" TFA%DCW "] that table 30 below summarizes cell, the concentration of often kind of lipid acid represented with % by weight [" %TFA "] accounting for TFA and the EPA content [" EPA%DCW "] represented with the per-cent accounting for dry cell wt.More particularly, lipid acid is accredited as 16:0 (palmitinic acid), 16:1 (Zoomeric acid), 18:0 (stearic acid), 18:1 (oleic acid), 18:2 (LA), ALA, EDA, DGLA, ARA, ETrA, ETA and EPA. 
 Table 31 to work and often kind of desaturase needed for the production of EPA and Δ 9 extend the transformation efficiency of enzyme to summarize with the identical mode described in embodiment 9 in PUFA biosynthetic pathway. 
 
 
 
 Based on the data in above table 30 and table 31, the expression of ScLPAATS and YlLPAAT1 in bacterial strain Y8406U::YlLPAAT1, Y8406U::ScLPAATS-5 and Y8406U::ScLPAATS-6 of producing EPA all result in by TFA % by weight the reduction (reaching 76% or lower of contrast) of LA (18:2) concentration [" LA%TFA "] and Δ 9 extend the rising (reaching at least 7% of contrast) of enzymatic conversion efficiency.ScLPAATS with YlLPAAT1 has similar impact to lipodogramme. 
 Then, those acquisition are compared, although have employed different modes to characterize LPLAT in the result obtained above and embodiment 9.Specifically, in embodiment 9, because carrier lacks ARS sequence, the linearizing DNA carrying LPLAT is converted by chromosomal integration.Which results in stable integration, and in preculture and the growth of 2 days before being ported to HGM, bacterial strain is all grown in relative abundance, nonselective FM growth medium. 
 In embodiment 11, functionally carry out on the plasmid being characterized in self-replacation of YlLPAAT1 and ScLPAATS.Therefore, Yarrowia lipolytica strain Y8406 is transformed with the cyclic DNA carrying often kind of LPAAT and ARS sequence.Also detecting the expression of the gene do not integrated in order to maintain these plasmids, in preculture and the growth of 2 days before being ported to HGM, transformant must be made in the upper growth of Selective agar medium (that is, CSM-U substratum). 
 These differences above-described can facilitate the difference of lipodogramme and content, as in embodiment 9 and 11 by as shown in the expression of YlLPAAT1.In embodiment 9, based on the expression of YlLPAAT, LA%TFA, EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency and are respectively 63%, 115% and 115% relative to the change of contrast, and in embodiment 11, based on the expression of YlLPAAT, LA%TFA, EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency and are respectively 76%, 101% and 107% relative to the change of contrast.Therefore, compared with viewed in embodiment 9, in embodiment 11, Δ 9 extension and the biosynthetic improvement of LC-PUFA are minimized.These differences can owing to " position effect " of chromosomal integration and/or different growth conditionss. 
 With regard to ScLPAATS and YlLPAAT with regard to being transferred into Yarrowia lipolytica strain Y8406 on autonomously replicating plasmid, LC-PUFA is biosynthetic, and to improve (being measured as the rising that the reduction of LA%TFA, the rising of EPA%TFA and Δ 9 extend enzymatic conversion efficiency) be similar, expects that these two kinds of LPLAAT will play similar function equally when stable integration enters host chromosome.Therefore, ScLPAATS probably will improve lipodogramme to be entered viewed similar mode in the embodiment 9 of host chromosome by stable integration to YlLPAAT1.
