 G3-1 is being contained into 250mL seed flask culture medium (20g glucose L -1 , 5g yeast extract L -1 、2g NaCl L -1 、4g MgSO 4  L -1 、1g MSG L -1 With 3mg copper sulphate L -1 , 2mg sodium molybdate L -1 , 3mg zinc sulfate L -1 , 2mg cobalt chloride (II) L -1 , 2mg manganese chloride L -1 With 2mg nickel sulfate L -1 ) erlenmeyer flask in preculture.By flask under 25 DEG C and 200rpm of stirring
It is incubated for 2 days.After incubation period, the cell of the preculture of 0.14L is transferred in 1.26L VU3 culture medium.Every liter of VU3 culture medium
Composition be: 2g yeast extract, 5g MSG, 10g (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 66g crude glycerine, 2g NaCl, 4g MgSO 4 、1.6g
KH 2 PO 4 、1.75g K 2 HPO 4 , 3mg copper sulphate, 2mg sodium molybdate, 3mg zinc sulfate, 2mg cobalt chloride (II), 2mg manganese chloride, 2mg
Nickel sulfate, 0.1g calcium chloride dehydrate, 0.01g cobalamin, 0.01g biotin and 2g thiamine hydrochloride.In 2L fermentor
Batch fermentation is carried out under the following conditions: 25 DEG C, being ventilated at 1VVM with atmospheric air, is started to stir at 550rpm and reach
710rpm.During initial 65.75 hours of fermentation, the pH of culture is maintained at about by using ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution
6.16-6.26.Then Ammonia is exchanged with 5M NaOH so that pH is maintained at 6.05 or so until fermentation 188.5 hours.
Cell is collected with 6-18 hours intervals, and measures biomass, TFA, palmitinic acid, DHA and EPA.After fermentation 40 hours, training
The initial glucose supported in base is completely depleted, and then at that time by culture feed supplement 1120g crude glycerine L -1 , until fermentation stops
The 188.5th hour when only.At the end of the process, the productivity of biomass and TFA are 0.33g L -1 h -1 With 0.05g L -   1 h -1 .On the other hand, DHA and EPA content (% for being expressed as TFA) are 55% and 4.1%.Previous in embodiment, work as grape
Sugar be used as carbon source when, G3-1 show in its lipid part accumulate EPA ability it is poor (its content TFA 0.5% to
In 1% range), but amount 3 times high (table 17, figure under conditions of describing in this embodiment, by the EPA of G3-1 synthesis
11).Nutritional deficiency or toxic chemical in bad condition of culture such as fluid nutrient medium have stimulated thraustochytriale synthesis EPA.It is false
If being to provide oxidation resistance by thraustochytriale biosynthesis EPA and other PUFA to protect cell when being subjected to oxidative stress
(Ugalde et al., J.Appl.Phycol. (2017)). 
 
 
 
 During initial 65.75 hours of fermentation, by the Ammonia pulse of 74.5mL into 2L container.From
65.75 hours to 188.5 hours, Ammonia is exchanged into the solution of NaOH 5M so that pH is maintained at about 6.05 and is pushed away
Dynamic G3-1 cellular accumulation lipid.As shown in table 17, facilitate to increase biomass content in the pulse nitrogen of ammonium hydroxide form, so
And Ammonia is exchanged into NaOH 5M and keeps five days lipid accumulations being unfavorable in G3-1 cell of reruning of fermenting.
G3-1 cellular uptake is in the nitrogen of ammonium hydroxide form, but seems that the catabolism of ammonium hydroxide interferes the lipids, biological in G3-1 to close
At approach.On the other hand, not only ammonium sulfate but also crude glycerine be used as carbon raw material may have stress G3-1 cell.The present embodiment
Used in crude glycerine contain 0.8% methanol and high salinity, these impurity are even for the ocean for being resistant to high salinity environment
Microalgae also functions as stress factors.It was reported that abiotic stress often causes amino acid (it serves as potential stress alleviant) tired
Product.Other than the structure block as protein, amino acid act also as the molecule containing N for example nucleic acid, polyamines, quaternary ammonium compound and
The precursor of some hormones.Under environment-stress, usually inhibits from the beginning protein synthesis and protein conversion and proteolysis are living
Property increase, so as to cause total free amino acid increase.N and C metabolism is closely related；N assimilation and amino acid bio synthesis need to subtract
Few equivalent (for example, glucose, glycerol etc.) from carbon metablism and C framework (Chen etc. from tricarboxylic acids (TCA) circulation
People, Biotechnol.Biofuels 10:153 (2017)).In fermentation ends (for example, at 188.5 hours), even if G3-1
The crude glycerine of cell consumption 160.5g, G3-1 cell also have accumulated 15.6% lipid within endothelial cells (table 17).Seem by crude glycerine
The different metabolic approach that the energy and C framework for being metabolized generation are not used in lipid accumulation, but are redirected in G3-1 cell.
