 Background technology 
 Prostaglandin(PG) (PG) is the physiologically active substance being called as prostanoid together with thromboxane, is the lipid with prostanoic acid skeleton.The prostanoids such as prostaglandin(PG) utilize Phospholipase A2 biosynthetic by the arachidonic acid free from membrane phospholipid matter.Prostaglandin(PG) is divided into each group of A ~ J according to the difference investing its pentacyclic Sauerstoffatom and double bond.In addition, according to the double key number of prostanoic acid skeleton side chain, be divided into 1 ~ 3 group.Such as, in PGE (PGE), have the PGE that the double key number that exists in prostanoic acid skeleton side chain is different
         1 , PGE
         2 , PGE
         3 each group.
       
 For PG, by utilizing cyclooxygenase I(COX-I) or cyclooxygenase II(COX-II) from the biosynthetic PGG of arachidonic acid
         2 and produce PGH
         2 , thereafter, according to the difference of the fracture of key between Sauerstoffatom, produce PGD
         2 , PGE
         2 , PGF
         2 α deng.And then, by PGE
         2 produce PGA
         2 , PGC
         2 deng.Think that the formation reaction of each PG produces according to the effect of specific enzymes, in these enzymes, there is tissue specificity, produce the PG adapted with the function of each tissue.
       
 In PG, PGE has various important biological activity, thinks relevant to vasodilation, blood pressure drops, uterine contraction and immune adjustment etc. via its specific acceptor.PGE
         2 acceptor be 7 film through G-protein matter coupled receptors in the same manner as other PG acceptor.PGE
         2 acceptor referred to as EP, known existence 4 kinds of hypotypes (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4).Each hypotype in vivo, Ca in EP1 and cell
         2+ rising be correlated with, EP2 is relevant with the rising of EP4 and cAMP, the minimizing of EP3 and cAMP relevant (non-patent literature 1).4 kinds of hypotypes have very high homogeny on protein construct.
       
 Report by the high low molecular compound antagonist of EP4 selectivity to mouse administration induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or contact hypersensitivity time, the accumulation of TH1 and the TH17 cell in affiliated lymphatic node reduces, and inhibits advancing of disease (non-patent literature 2).Show in dendritic cell, PGE
         2 due to EP4 activation caused by cAMP rise and make the generation of IL-23 hyperfunction.In addition, show in TH17 cell, PGE
         2 the propagation of TH17 cell is caused in phase with IL-23.Show in TH17 cell, the cAMP caused by the activation of EP4 rises and plays an important role (non-patent literature 3) to intracellular messengers transmission.From such report, PGE
         2 the disease that acceptor, particularly EP4 selective antagonist cause the dysimmunity for the treatment of because TH1 or TH17 relates to is effective, and this disease such as has (non-patent literatures 2) such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel and contact dermatitis.
       
 Report most cancer cells compared with normal cell, COX-II overexpression.And then display PGE
         2 cancerous tissue or perienchyma are worked, relevant with the development of cancer.Such as, PGE is shown
         2 to intractable inflammatory breast cancer cell or lung carcinoma cell to shifting the infiltration organized relevant (non-patent literature 4,5).In addition we know, PGE
         2 relevant via EP4 and non-small cell lung cancer cell, colorectal cancer cells, inflammatory breast cancer cell, bone-marrow-derived lymphocyte, prostate cancer cell, melanomatous propagation.
       
 Known NK cell has the effect of directtissima cancer cells, but PGE
         2 suppress this effect.As PGE
         2 suppress the mechanism of NK cytoactive, the intracellular cAMP caused by activation showing EP4 rises (non-patent literature 6).In addition, known being considered to suppresses the Treg cell of cancer immunity to activate via EP4, likely makes to reduce (non-patent literature 7) the immunologic mechanism of cancer cells in organism.From such report, PGE
         2 very important to the development of cancer.Therefore, to attempt and PGE
         2 the generation clinical study of the non-selective inhibitor of COX of being correlated with, but achievement cannot be treated fully due to side effect.PGE
         2 acceptor, particularly EP4 selective antagonist can the propagation of direct anticancer, and the cancer immunologic mechanism of self can be activated, so expect that the treatment of antibody to various cancer combined with EP4 receptor-selective ground is effective, described cancer such as has mammary cancer, large bowel cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, skin carcinoma, B lymphoma.
       
 In the past, nonspecific COX inhibitor was for reducing pain.But, known nonspecific inhibitor can produce pyrosis, maldigestion, feel sick, abdominal distension, diarrhoea, stomachache, peptide ulceration, digestive tract hemorrhage and so on side effect.In recent years, for the purpose of pain therapy, develop COX-II selective depressant (such as celecoxib, rofecoxib).But COX-II selective depressant may cause serious cardiac system disturbances in specific patient, seek to utilize different mechanism of action to reduce the medicament of pain.In the PG produced by COX, known PGE
         2 the supersensitivity of the pain sensation can be made to strengthen.Multiple animal experiment is particularly utilized to demonstrate PGE
         2 in acceptor, EP4 is relevant with hypersensitive enhancing of the pain sensation.Such as known for rat spinal cord posterior root ganglion (DRG), in inflammatory pain template, the expression of EP4 strengthens, and the alternative antagonist (AH23848) of EP4 can reduce the susceptibility (non-patent literature 8) of the pain in same template.In addition, in the parsing using EP4 knock out mice, identical result (non-patent literature 9) is also obtained.From such report, optionally block the disease of pharmaceuticals to concomitant immunity exception of the function of EP4, cancer, pain treatment effective, and few side effects.
       
 As the method for function optionally blocking EP4, report multiple antagonist that make use of low molecular compound, but also successfully do not develop as pharmaceuticals.For the antagonist of low molecular compound, to PGE
         2 receptor subtype (EP1 ~ 4) in conjunction with selectivity, the leeway minimizing aspect of the binding affinity of thromboxane or other Prostanoid Receptor being had to improvement.If there is no sufficient receptor-selective, the side effect identical with COX inhibitor may be produced.
       
 Expect that the antibody be combined with EP4 receptor-selective is higher than low molecular compound receptor-selective.In addition, antibody is medical compared with low molecular compound, long half time in general blood, so expect that single administration just keeps drug effect for a long time, useful to chronic disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, colitis, cancer etc.). 
 Antibody medicine after to the main mechanism of membrane protein (acceptor), normally antibody recognition expresses the cell of this protein, removes based on complement dependent cellular solvency action (CDC) and the interposed cell disorders effect (ADCC) of antibody dependent cellular.But, CDC, ADCC along with the activation of the inflammatory cells such as scavenger cell, not talkative certain disease, pain therapy be applicable to because dysimmunity causes.Therefore, by optionally suppress the monoclonal antibody of EP4 to be applied to because dysimmunity causes disease, pain therapy when, preferably not based on the functional antibodies of CDC, ADCC.That is, the intracellular messengers transmission that EP4 relies on preferably optionally is blocked. 
 At present, the existing record for the adquisitiones of the antibody of EP4 in No. 3118460th, patent (patent documentation 1), but also do not report suppress its function specifically with low consumption EP4 and the concrete antibody be not combined with EP1, EP2, EP3.In addition, in the adquisitiones of the general monoclonal antibody recorded in No. 3118460th, patent, known being usually difficult to obtains the functional antibodies for 7 through acceptors of film.
