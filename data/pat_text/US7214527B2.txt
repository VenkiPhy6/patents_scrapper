 This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/321,188 filed Dec. 17, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,608, and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60,344,271, filed December 26, 2001, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to isolated nucleic acids sequences and polypeptides encoded thereby for epothilone B hydroxylase and mutants and variants thereof, and a ferredoxin located downstream from the epothilone B hydroxylase gene. The present invention also relates to recombinant microorganisms expressing epothilone B hydroxylase or a mutant or variant thereof and/or ferredoxin which are capable of hydroxylating small organic molecule compounds, such as epothilones, having a terminal alkyl group to produce compounds having a terminal hydroxyalkyl group. Also provided are methods for recombinantly producing such microorganisms as well as methods for using these recombinant microorganisms in the synthesis of compounds having a terminal hydroxylalkyl group. The compositions and methods of the present invention are useful in preparation of epothilones having a variety of utilities in the pharmaceutical field. A novel epothilone analog produced using a mutant of epothilone B hydroxylase of the present invention is also described. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Epothilones are macrolide compounds that find utility in the pharmaceutical field. For example, epothilones A and B having the structures: 
                     
have been found to exert microtubule-stabilizing effects similar to paclitaxel (TAXOL®) and hence cytotoxic activity against rapidly proliferating cells, such as, tumor cells or cells associated with other hyperproliferative cellular diseases, see Bollag et al.,  Cancer Res ., Vol. 55, No. 11, 2325–2333 (1995).
 
 Epothilones A and B are natural anticancer agents produced by  Sorangium cellulosum  that were first isolated and characterized by Hofle et al., DE 4138042; WO 93/10121 ; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl . Vol. 35, No13/14, 1567–1569 (1996); and  J. Antibiot ., Vol. 49, No. 6, 560–563 (1996). Subsequently, the total syntheses of epothilones A and B have been published by Balog et al.,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl ., Vol. 35, No. 23/24, 2801–2803, 1996; Meng et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc ., Vol. 119, No. 42, 10073–10092 (1997); Nicolaou et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc ., Vol. 119, No. 34, 7974–7991 (1997); Schinzer et al.,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng ., Vol. 36, No. 5, 523–524 (1997); and Yang et al.,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl ., Vol. 36, No. 1/2, 166–168, 1997. WO 98/25929 disclosed the methods for chemical synthesis of epothilone A, epothilone B, analogs of epothilone and libraries of epothilone analogs. The structure and production from  Sorangium cellulosum  DSM 6773 of epothilones C, D, E, and F was disclosed in WO 98/22461.  FIG. 1  provides a diagram of the biotransformation as described in WO 00/39276 of epothilone B to epothilone F in  Actinomycetes  species strain SC15847 (ATCC PT-1043), subsequently identified as  Amycolatopsis orientalis.    
 Cytochrome P450 enzymes are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells and have in common a heme binding domain which can be distinguished by an absorbance peak at 450 nm when complexed with carbon monoxide. Cytochrome P450 enzymes perform a broad spectrum of oxidative reactions on primarily hydrophobic substrates including aromatic and benzylic rings, and alkanes. In prokaryotes they are found as detoxifying systems and as a first enzymatic step in metabolizing substrates such as toluene, benzene and camphor. Cytochrome P450 genes have also been found in biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites such as nikkomycin in  Streptomyces tendae  (Bruntner, C. et al, 1999, Mol. Gen. Genet. 262: 102–114), doxorubicin (Dickens, M. L, Strohl, W. R., 1996, J. Bacteriol, 178: 3389-3395) and in the epothilone biosynthetic cluster of  Sorangium cellulosum  (Julien, B. et al., 2000, Gene, 249: 153–160). With a few exceptions, the cytochrome P450 systems in prokaryotes are composed of three proteins; a ferredoxin NADH or NADPH dependent reductase, an iron-sulfur ferredoxin and the cytochrome P450 enzyme (Lewis, D. F., Hlavica, P., 2000, Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1460: 353–374). Electrons are transferred from ferredoxin reductase to the ferredoxin and finally to the cytochrome P450 enzyme for the splitting of molecular oxygen.

 In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there are provided isolated polynucleotides that encode epothilone B hydroxylase, an enzyme capable of hydroxylating epothilones having a terminal alkyl group to produce epothilones having a terminal hydroxyalkyl group. 
 In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there are provided isolated polynucleotides that encode a ferredoxin, the gene for which is located downstream from the epothilone B hydroxylase gene. Ferredoxin is a protein of the cytochrome P450 system. 
 By “polynucleotides”, as used herein, it is meant to include any form of DNA or RNA such as cDNA or genomic DNA or mRNA, respectively, encoding these enzymes or an active fragment thereof which are obtained by cloning or produced synthetically by well known chemical techniques. DNA may be double- or single-stranded. Single-stranded DNA may comprise the coding or sense strand or the non-coding or antisense strand. Thus, the term polynucleotide also includes polynucleotides exhibiting at least 60% or more, preferably at least 80%, homology to sequences disclosed herein, and which hybridize under stringent conditions to the above-described polynucleotides. As used herein, the term “stringent conditions” means hybridization conditions of 60° C. at 2×SSC buffer. More preferred are isolated nucleic acid molecules capable of hybridizing to the nucleic acid sequence set forth in 1, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, or 74 or SEQ ID NO:3, or to the complementary sequence of the nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, or 74 or SEQ ID NO:3, under hybridization conditions of 3×SSC at 65° C. for 16 hours, and which are capable of remaining hybridized to the nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 or 74 or SEQ ID NO:3, or to the complementary sequence of the nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 or 42, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 or 74 or SEQ ID NO:3, under wash conditions of 0.5×SSC, 55° C. for 30 minutes. 
 In one embodiment, a polynucleotide of the present invention comprises the genomic DNA depicted in SEQ ID NO:1 or a homologous sequence or fragment thereof which encodes a polypeptide having similar activity to that of this epothilone B hydroxylase. Alternatively, a polynucleotide of the present invention may comprise the genomic DNA depicted in SEQ ID NO:3 or a homologous sequence or fragment thereof which encodes a polypeptide having similar activity to this ferredoxin. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, polynucleotides of the present invention may also comprise other nucleic acid sequences encoding this enzyme and derivatives, variants or active fragments thereof. 
 The present invention also relates to variants of these polynucleotides which may be naturally occurring, i.e., present in microorganisms such as  Amycolatopsis orientalis  and  Amycolata autotrophica , or in soil or other sources from which nucleic acids can be isolated, or mutants prepared by well known mutagenesis techniques. Exemplary variants polynucleotides of the present invention are depicted in SEQ ID NO: 36–42. 
 By “mutants” as used herein it is meant to be inclusive of nucleic acid sequences with one or more point mutations, or deletions or additions of nucleic acids as compared to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, but which still encode a polypeptide or fragment with similar activity to the polypeptides encoded by SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3. In a preferred embodiment, mutations are made which alter the substrate specificity and/or yield of the enzyme. A preferred region of mutation with respect to the epothilone B hydroxylase gene is that region of the nucleic acid sequence coding for the approximately 113 amino acids residues comprising the active site of the enzyme. Also preferred are mutants encoding a polypeptide with at least one amino acid substitution at amino acid position GLU31, ARG67, ARG88, ILE92, ALA93, VAL106, ILE130, ALA140, MET176, PHE190, GLU 231, SER294, PHE237, or ILE365 of SEQ ID NO:1. Exemplary polynucleotide mutants of the present invention are depicted in SEQ ID NO: 30, 32, 34, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74. 
 Cloning of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 encoding epothilone B hydroxylase was performed using PCR primers designed by aligning the nucleic acid sequences of six cytochrome P450 genes from bacteria. The following cytochrome P450 genes were aligned:
         Sequence: Locus: STMSUACB; Accession number: M32238; Reference: Omer, C. A., J. Bacteriol. 172: 3335–3345 (1990)   Sequence: Locus: STMSUBCB; Accession number: M32239; Reference: Omer, C. A., J. Bacteriol. 172: 3335–3345 (1990)   Sequence: Locus: AB018074 (formerly STMORFA); Accession number: AB018074; Reference: Ueda, K., J. Antibiot. 48: 638–646 (1995)   Sequence: Locus: SSU65940; Accession number: U65940; Reference: Motamedi, H., J. Bacteriol. 178: 5243–5248 (1996)   Sequence: Locus: STMOLEP; Accession number: L37200; Reference: Rodriguez, A. M., FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 127: 117–120 (1995)   Sequence: Locus: SERCP450A; Accession number: M83110; Reference: Andersen, J. F. and Hutchinson, C. R., J. Bacteriol. 174: 725–735 (1992)       
 Alignments were performed using an implementation of the algorithm of Myers, E. W. and W. Miller. 1988 . CABIOS  4:1, 11–17., the Align program from Scientific and Educational Software (Durham, N.C., USA). Three highly conserved regions were identified in the I-helix, containing the oxygen binding domain, in the K-helix, and spanning the B-bulge and L-helix containing the conserved heme binding domain. Primers were designed to the three conserved regions identified in the alignment. Primers P450-1 +  (SEQ ID NO:23) and P450-1a +  (SEQ ID NO:24) were designed from the I helix, Primer P450-2 +  (SEQ ID NO:25) was designed from the B-Bulge and L-helix region and Primer P450-3 −  (SEQ ID NO:27) was designed as the reverse complement to the heme binding protein. 
 Genomic fragments were then amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After PCR amplification, the reaction products were separated by gel electrophoresis and fragments of the expected size were excised. The DNA was extracted from the agarose gel slices using the Qiaquick gel extraction procedure (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, Calif., USA). The fragments were then cloned into the PCRscript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA) using the PCRscript Amp cloning kit (Stratagene). Colonies containing inserts were picked to 1–2 ml of LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30–37° C., 16–24 hours, 230–300 rpm. Plasmid isolation was performed using the Mo Bio miniplasmid prep kit (Mo Bio, Solano Beach, Calif., USA). This plasmid DNA was used as a PCR and sequencing template and for restriction digest analysis. 
 The cloned PCR products were sequenced using the Big-Dye sequencing kit from Applied Biosystems, (Foster City, Calif., USA) and were analyzed using the AB1310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA). The sequence of the inserts was used to perform a TblastX search, using the protocol of Altschul, S. F, et al.,  Mol. Biol.  215:403–410 (1990), of the non-redundant protein database. Unique sequences having a significant similarity to known cytochrome P450 proteins were retained. Using this approach, a total of nine different P450 sequences were identified from SC15847, seven from the genomic DNA template and two from the cDNA. Two P450 sequences were found in common between the DNA and cDNA templates. Of the fifty cDNA clones analyzed, two sequences were predominant, with twenty clones each. These two genes were then cloned from the genomic DNA. 
 The nucleic acid sequence of the genomic DNA was determined using the Big-Dye sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using an ABI310 sequencer. This sequence is depicted in SEQ ID NO:1. An open reading frame coding for a protein of 404 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 44.7 kDa was found within the cloned BglII fragment. The deduced amino acid sequence of this polypeptide is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2. The amino acid sequence of this polypeptide was found to share 51% identity with the NikF protein of  Streptomyces tendae  (Bruntner, C. et al, 1999, Mol. Gen. Genet. 262: 102–114) and 48% identity with the Sca-2 protein of  S. carbophilus  (Watanabe, I. Et al, 1995, Gene 163: 81–85). Both of these enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family 105. The invariable cysteine found in the heme-binding domain of all cytochrome P450 enzymes is found at residue 356. This gene for epothilone B hydroxylase has been named ebh. The ATG start codon of a putative ferredoxin gene of 64 amino acids is found nine basepairs downstream from the stop codon of ebh. This enzyme was found to share 50% identity with ferredoxin genes of  S. griseoulus  (O'Keefe, D. P., et al, 1991, Biochemistry 30: 447–455) and  S. noursei  (Brautaset, T., et al, 2000, Chem. Biol. 7: 395–403). The nucleic acid sequence encoding this ferredoxin is depicted in SEQ ID NO:3 and the amino acid sequence for this ferredoxin polypeptide is depicted in SEQ ID NO:4. 
 The ebh gene sequence was also used to isolate variant cytochrome P450 genes from other microorganisms. Exemplary variant polynucleotides ebh43491, ebh14930, ebh53630, ebh53550, ebh39444, ebh43333 and ebh35165 of the present invention and the species from which they were isolated are depicted in Table 1 below.

 Mutations were also introduced into the coding region of the ebh gene to identify mutants with improved yield, and/or rate of bioconversion and/or altered substrate specificity. Exemplary mutant nucleic acid sequences of the present invention are depicted in SEQ ID NO:30, 32, 34, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74. 
 The nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:30 encodes a mutant ebh25-1 which exhibits altered substrate specificity. Plasmid pANT849ebh25-1 containing this mutant gene was deposited and accepted by an International Depository Authority under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty. The deposit was made on Nov. 21, 2002 to the American Type Culture Collection at 10801 University Boulevard in Manassas, Va. 20110-2209. The ATCC Accession Number is PTA-4809. All restrictions upon public access to this plasmid will be irrevocably removed upon granting of this patent application. The Deposit will be maintained in a public depository for a period of thirty years after the date of deposit or five years after the last request for a sample or for the enforceable life of the patent, whichever is longer. The above-referenced plasmid was viable at the time of the deposit. The deposit will be replaced if viable samples cannot be dispensed by the depository. 
 This  S. lividans  transformant identified in the screening of mutation 25 (primers NPB29-mut25f (SEQ ID NO:58) and NPB29-mut25r (SEQ ID NO:59)) was found to produce a product with a different HPLC elution time than epothilone B or epothilone F.

 Thus, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there are provided isolated polypeptides of epothilone B hydroxylase and variants and mutants thereof and isolated polypeptides of ferredoxin or variants thereof. In one embodiment of the present invention, by “polypeptide” it is meant to include the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and fragments or variants, which retain essentially the same biological activity and/or function as this epothilone B hydroxylase. In another embodiment of the present invention, by “polypeptide” it is meant to include the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4, and fragments and/or variants, which retain essentially the same biological activity and/or function as this ferredoxin. 
 By “variants” as used herein it is meant to include polypeptides with amino acid sequences with conservative amino acid substitutions as compared to SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4 which are demonstrated to exhibit similar biological activity and/or function to SEQ ID NO:2 or 4. By “conservative amino acid substitutions” it is meant to include replacement, one for another, of the aliphatic amino acids such as Ala, Val, Leu and Ile, the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr, the acidic residues Asp and Glu, and the amide residues Asn and Gln. Exemplary variant amino acid sequences of the present invention are depicted in SEQ ID NO:43–49 and the amino acid substitutions of these exemplary variants are described in Table 2, supra. 
 By “mutants” as used herein it is meant to include polypeptides encoded by nucleic acid sequences with one or more point mutations, or deletions or additions of nucleic acids as compared to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, but which still have similar activity to the polypeptides encoded by SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3. In a preferred embodiment, mutations are made to the nucleic acid that alter the substrate specificity and/or yield from the polypeptide encoded thereby. A preferred region of mutation with respect to the epothilone B hydroxylase gene is that region of the nucleic acid sequence coding for the approximately 113 amino acid residues comprising the active site of the enzyme. Also preferred are mutants with at least one amino acid substitution at amino acid position GLU31, ARG67, ARG88, ILE92, ALA93, VAL106, ILE130, ALA140, MET176, PHE190, GLU 231, SER294, PHE237, or ILE365 of SEQ ID NO:1 Exemplary mutants ebh25-1, ebh10-53, ebh24-16, ebh24-16d8, ebh24-16c11, ebh24-16-16, ebh24-16-74, ebh24-16g8, ebh24-16b9 and the nucleic acid sequences encoding such mutants of the present invention are depicted in SEQ ID NO:31, 33, 35, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73 and 75, and SEQ ID NO:30, 32, 34, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74, respectively. 
 A 3-dimensional model of epothilone B hydroxylase has also been constructed in accordance with general teachings of Greer et al. (Comparative modeling of homologous proteins. Methods In Enzymology 202239-52, 1991), Lesk et al. (Homology Modeling: Inferences from Tables of Aligned Sequences. Curr. Op. Struc. Biol. (2) 242–247, 1992), and Cardozo et al. (Homology modeling by the ICM method. Proteins 23, 403–14, 1995) on the basis of the known structure of a homologous protein EryF (PDB Code 1KIN chain A). Homology between these sequences is 34%. Alignment of the sequences of epothilone B hydroxylase (SEQ ID NO:2) and EryF (PDB Code 1KIN chain A; SEQ ID NO:76) is depicted in  FIG. 3 . A homology model of epothilone B hydroxylase based upon sequence alignment with EryF is depicted in  FIG. 4 . 
 An energy plot of the epothilone B hydroxylase model relative to EryF (PDB code 1JIN) was also prepared and is depicted in  FIG. 5 . An averaging window size of 51 residues was used at a given residue position to calculate the average of the energies of the 51 residues in the sequence that lie with the given residue at the central position. As shown in  FIG. 5 , all energies along the sequence lie below zero thus indicating that the modeled structure as set forth in  FIG. 4  and  Appendix  1 is reasonable. 
 The three-dimensional structure represented in the homology model of epothilone B hydroxylase of  FIG. 4  is defined by a set of structure coordinates as set forth in  Appendix  1. The term “structure coordinates” refers to Cartesian coordinates generated from the building of a homology model. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, however, a set of structure coordinates for a protein is a relative set of points that define a shape in three dimensions. Thus, it is possible that an entirely different set of coordinates could define a similar or identical shape. Moreover, slight variations in the individual coordinates, as emanate from generation of similar homology models using different alignment templates and/or using different methods in generating the homology model, will have minor effects on the overall shape. Variations in coordinates may also be generated because of mathematical manipulations of the structure coordinates. For example, the structure coordinates set forth in  Appendix  1 could be manipulated by fractionalization of the structure coordinates; integer additions or subtractions to sets of the structure coordinates, inversion of the structure coordinates or any combination of the above. 
 Various computational analyses are therefore necessary to determine whether a molecule or a portion thereof is sufficiently similar to all or parts of epothilone B hydroxylase described above as to be considered the same. Such analyses may be carried out in current software applications, such as SYBYL version 6.7 or INSIGHTII (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, Calif.) version 2000 and as described in the accompanying User's Guides. 
 For example, the superimposition tool in the program SYBYL allows comparisons to be made between different structures and different conformations of the same structure. The procedure used in SYBYL to compare structures is divided into four steps: 1) load the structures to be compared; 2) define the atom equivalencies in these structures; 3) perform a fitting operation; and 4) analyze the results. Each structure is identified by a name. One structure is identified as the target (i.e., the fixed structure); the second structure (i.e., moving structure) is identified as the source structure. Since atom equivalency within SYBYL is defined by user input, for the purpose of this aspect of the present invention equivalent atoms are defined as protein backbone atoms (N, Cα, C and O) for all conserved residues between the two structures being compared. Further, only rigid fitting operations are considered. When a rigid fitting method is used, the working structure is translated and rotated to obtain an optimum fit with the target structure. The fitting operation uses an algorithm that computes the optimum translation and rotation to be applied to the moving structure, such that the root mean square difference of the fit over the specified pairs of equivalent atoms is an absolute minimum. This number, given in angstroms, is reported by SYBYL. 
 For the purposes of the present invention, any homology model of epothilone B hydroxylase that has a root mean square deviation of conserved residue backbone atoms (N, Cα, C, O) of less than about 4.0 Å when superimposed on the corresponding backbone atoms described by structure coordinates listed in  Appendix  1 are considered identical. More preferably, the root mean square deviation is less than about 3.0 Å. More preferably the root mean square deviation is less than about 2.0 Å. 
 For the purpose of this invention, any homology model of epothilone B hydroxylase that has a root mean square deviation of conserved residue backbone atoms (N, Cα, C, O) of less than about 2.0 Å when superimposed on the corresponding backbone atoms described by structure coordinates listed in  Appendix  1 are considered identical. More preferably, the root mean square deviation is less than about 1.0 Å. 
 In another embodiment of the present invention, structural models wherein backbone atoms have been substituted with other elements which when superimposed on the corresponding backbone atoms have low root mean square deviations are considered to be identical. For example, an homology model where the original backbone carbon, and/or nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms are replaced with other elements having a root mean square deviation of about 4.0 Å, more preferably about 3.0 Å, even more preferably less than about 2 Å, when superimposed on the corresponding backbone atoms described by structure coordinates listed in  Appendix  1 is considered identical. 
 The term “root mean square deviation” means the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the mean. It is a way to express the deviation or variation from a trend or object. For purposes of this invention, the “root mean square deviation” defines the variation in the backbone of a protein from the relevant portion of the backbone of the epothilone B hydroxylase portion of the complex as defined by the structure coordinates described herein. 
 The present invention as embodied by the homology model enables the structure-based design of additional mutants of epothilone B hydroxylase. For example, using the homology model of the present invention, residues lying within 10 Å of the binding site of epothilone B hydroxylase have now been defined. These residues include LEU39, GLN43, ALA45, MET57, LEU58, HIS62, PHE63, SER64, SER65, ASP66, ARG67, GLN68, SER69, LEU74, MET75, VAL76, ALA77, ARG78, GLN79, ILE80, ASP84, LYS85, PRO86, PHE87, ARG88, PRO89, SER90, LEU91, ILE92, ALA93, MET94, ASP95, HIS99, ARG103, PHE110, ILE155, PHE169, GLN170, CYS172, SER173, SER174, ARG175, MET176, LEU177, SER178, ARG179, ARG186, PHE190, LEU193, VAL233, GLY234, LEU235, ALA236, PHE237, LEU238, LEU239, LEU240, ILE241, ALA242, GLY243, HIS244, GLU245, THR246, THR247, ALA248, ASN249, MET250, LEU283, THR287, ILE288, ALA289, GLU290, THR291, ALA292, THR293, SER294, ARG295, PHE296, ALA297, THR298, GLU312, GLY313, VAL314, VAL315, GLY316, VAL344, ALA345, PHE346, GLY347, PHE348, VAL350, HIS351, GLN352, CYS353, LEU354, GLY355, GLN356, LEU358, ALA359, GLU362, LYS389, ASP391, SER392, THR393, ILE394 and TYR395 as set forth in  Appendix  1. Mutants with mutations at one or more of these positions are expected to exhibit altered biological function and/or specificity and thus comprise another embodiment of preferred mutants of the present invention. Another embodiment of preferred mutants are molecules that have a root mean square deviation from the backbone atoms of said epothilone B hydroxylase of not more than about 4.0 Å. 
 The structure coordinates of an epothilone B hydroxylase homology model or portions thereof are stored in a machine-readable storage medium. Such data may be used for a variety of purposes, such as drug discovery. 
 Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention relates to machine-readable data storage medium comprising a data storage material encoded with the structure coordinates set forth in  Appendix  1. 
 The three-dimensional model structure of epothilone B hydroxylase can also be used to identify modulators of biological function and potential substrates of the enzyme. Various methods or combinations thereof can be used to identify such modulators. 
 For example, a test compound can be modeled that fits spatially into a binding site in epothilone B hydroxylase, according to  Appendix  1. Structure coordinates of amino acids within 10 Å of the binding region of epothilone B hydroxylase defined by amino acids LEU39, GLN43, ALA45, MET57, LEU58, HIS62, PHE63, SER64, SER65, ASP66, ARG67, GLN68, SER69, LEU74, MET75, VAL76, ALA77, ARG78, GLN79, ILE80, ASP84, LYS85, PRO86, PHE87, ARG88, PRO89, SER90, LEU91, ILE92, ALA93, MET94, ASP95, HIS99, ARG103, PHE110, ILE155, PHE169, GLN170, CYS172, SER173, SER174, ARG175, MET176, LEU177, SER178, ARG179, ARG186, PHE190, LEU193, VAL233, GLY234, LEU235, ALA236, PHE237, LEU238, LEU239, LEU240, ILE241, ALA242, GLY243, HIS244, GLU245, THR246, THR247, ALA248, ASN249, MET250, LEU283, THR287, ILE288, ALA289, GLU290, THR291, ALA292, THR293, SER294, ARG295, PHE296, ALA297, THR298, GLU312, GLY313, VAL314, VAL315, GLY316, VAL344, ALA345, PHE346, GLY347, PHE348, VAL350, HIS351, GLN352, CYS353, LEU354, GLY355, GLN356, LEU358, ALA359, GLU362, LYS389, ASP391, SER392, THR393, ILE394 and TYR395, and the coordinated heme group, HEM1 can also be used to identify desirable structural and chemical features of such modulators. Identified structural or chemical features can then be employed to design or select compounds as potential epothilone B hydroxylase ligands. By structural and chemical features it is meant to include, but is not limited to, covalent bonding, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions, charge interaction, hydrophobic bonding interaction, and dipole interaction. Compounds identified as potential epothilone B hydroxylase ligands can then be synthesized and screened in an assay characterized by binding of a test compound to epothilone B hydroxylase, or in characterizing the ability of epothilone B hydroxylase to modulate a protease target in the presence of a small molecule. Examples of assays useful in screening of potential epothilone B hydroxylase ligands include, but are not limited to, screening in silico, in vitro assays and high throughput assays. 
 As will be understood by those of skill in the art upon this disclosure, other structure-based design methods can be used. Various computational structure-based design methods have been disclosed in the art. For example, a number of computer modeling systems are available in which the sequence of epothilone B hydroxylase and the epothilone B hydroxylase structure (i.e., atomic coordinates of epothilone B hydroxylase as provided in  Appendix  1 and/or the atomic coordinates within 10 Å of the binding region as provided above) can be input. This computer system then generates the structural details of one or more these regions in which a potential epothilone B hydroxylase modulator binds so that complementary structural details of the potential modulators can be determined. Design in these modeling systems is generally based upon the compound being capable of physically and structurally associating with epothilone B hydroxylase. In addition, the compound must be able to assume a conformation that allows it to associate with epothilone B hydroxylase. Some modeling systems estimate the potential inhibitory or binding effect of a potential epothilone B hydroxylase substrate or modulator prior to actual synthesis and testing. 
 Methods for screening chemical entities or fragments for their ability to associate with a given protein target are also well known. Often these methods begin by visual inspection of the binding site on the computer screen. Selected fragments or chemical entities are then positioned in a binding region of epothilone B hydroxylase. Docking is accomplished using software such as INSIGHTII, QUANTA and SYBYL, following by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanic force fields such as, MMFF, CHARMM and AMBER. Examples of computer programs which assist in the selection of chemical fragment or chemical entities useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, GRID (Goodford, 1985), AUTODOCK (Goodsell, 1990), and DOCK (Kuntz et al. 1982). 
 Upon selection of preferred chemical entities or fragments, their relationship to each other and epothilone B hydroxylase can be visualized and then assembled into a single potential modulator. Programs useful in assembling the individual chemical entities include, but are not limited to CAVEAT (Bartlett et al. 1989) and 3D Database systems (Martin 1992). 
 Alternatively, compounds may be designed de novo using either an empty active site or optionally including some portion of a known inhibitor. Methods of this type of design include, but are not limited to LUDI (Bohm 1992) and LeapFrog (Tripos Inc., St. Louis Mo.). 
 Programs such as DOCK (Kuntz et al. 1982) can be used with the atomic coordinates from the homology model to identify potential ligands from databases or virtual databases which potentially bind the in the active site binding region which may therefore be suitable candidates for synthesis and testing. 
 Also provided in the present invention are vectors comprising polynucleotides of the present invention and host cells which are genetically engineered with vectors of the present invention to produce epothilone B hydroxylase or active fragments and variants or mutants of this enzyme and/or ferredoxin or active fragments thereof. Generally, any vector suitable to maintain, propagate or express polynucleotides to produce these polypeptides in the host cell may be used for expression in this regard. In accordance with this aspect of the invention the vector may be, for example, a plasmid vector, a single- or double-stranded phage vector, or a single- or double-stranded RNA or DNA viral vector.

 Vectors of the present invention for use in yeast will typically contain an origin of replication suitable for use in yeast and a selectable marker that is functional in yeast. Examples of yeast vectors useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, Yeast Integrating plasmids (e.g., YIp5) and Yeast Replicating plasmids (the YRp and YEp series plasmids), Yeast Centromere plasmids (the YCp series plasmids), Yeast Artificial Chromosomes (YACs) which are based on yeast linear plasmids, denoted YLp, pGPD-2, 2μ plasmids and derivatives thereof, and improved shuttle vectors such as those described in Gietz et al.,  Gene,  74: 527–34 (1988) (YIplac, YEplac and YCplac). 
 Mammalian vectors useful for recombinant expression may include a viral origin, such as the SV40 origin (for replication in cell lines expressing the large T-antigen, such as COS1 and COS7 cells), the papillomavirus origin, or the EBV origin for long term episomal replication (for use, e.g., in 293-EBNA cells, which constitutively express the EBV EBNA-1 gene product and adenovirus E1A). Expression in mammalian cells can be achieved using a variety of plasmids, including, but not limited to, pSV2, pBC12BI, and p91023, pCDNA vectors as well as lytic virus vectors (e.g., vaccinia virus, adeno virus, and baculovirus), episomal virus vectors (e.g., bovine papillomavirus), and retroviral vectors (e.g., murine retroviruses). Useful vectors for insect cells include baculoviral vectors and pVL941. 
 Selection of an appropriate promoter to direct mRNA transcription and construction of expression vectors are well known. In general, however, expression constructs will contain sites for transcription initiation and termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated. 
 Examples of useful promoters for prokaryotes include, but are not limited to phage promoters such as phage lambda pL promoter, the trc promoter, a hybrid derived from the trp and lac promoters, the bacteriophage T7 promoter, the TAC or TRC system, the major operator and promoter regions of phage lambda, the control regions of fd coat protein, snpA promoter, melC promotor, ermE* promoter or the araBAD operon. Examples of useful promoters for yeast include, but are not limited to, the CYC1 promoter, the GAL1 promoter, the GAL10 promoter, ADH1 promoter, the promoters of the yeast α-mating system, and the GPD promoter. Examples of promoters routinely used in mammalian expression vectors include, but are not limited to, the CMV immediate early promoter, the HSV thymidine kinase promoter, the early and late SV40 promoters, the promoters of retroviral LTRs, such as those of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), and metallothionein promoters, such as the mouse metallothionein-I promoter. 
 Vectors comprising the polynucleotides can be introduced into host cells using any number of well known techniques including infection, transduction, transfection, transvection and transformation. The polynucleotides may be introduced into a host alone or with additional polynucleotides encoding, for example, a selectable marker or ferredoxin reductase. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the polynucleotide for epothilone B hydroxylase and ferredoxin are introduced into the host cell. Host cells for the various expression constructs are well known, and those of skill can routinely select a host cell for expressing the epothilone B hydroxylase and/or ferredoxin in accordance with this aspect of the present invention. Examples of mammalian expression systems useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa, human kidney 293 and BHK cell lines, and the COS-7 line of monkey kidney fibroblasts. 
 Alternatively, as exemplified herein, epothilone B hydroxylase and ferredoxin can be expressed recombinantly in microorganisms. 
 Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention relates to recombinantly produced microorganisms which express epothilone B hydroxylase alone or in conjunction with the ferredoxin and which are capable of hydroxylating a compound, and in particular an epothilone, having a terminal alkyl group to produce ones having a terminal hydroxyalkyl group. The recombinantly produced microorganisms are produced by transforming cells such as bacterial cells with a plasmid comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding epothilone B hydroxylase. In a preferred embodiment, the cells are transformed with a plasmid comprising a nucleic acid encoding epothilone B hydroxylase or mutants or variants thereof as well as the nucleic acid sequence encoding ferredoxin located downstream of the epothilone B hydroxylase gene. Examples of microorganisms which can be transformed with these plasmids to produce the recombinant microorganisms of the present invention include, but are not limited,  Escherichia coli, Bacillus megaterium, Amycolatopsis orientalis, Sorangium cellulosum, Rhodococcus erythropolis , and  Streptomyces  species such as  Streptomyces lividans, Streptomyces virginiae, Streptomyces venezuelae, Streptomyces albus, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces rimosus  and  Streptomyces griseus.    
 The recombinantly produced microorganisms of the present invention are useful in microbial processes or methods for production of compounds, and in particular epothilones, containing a terminal hydroxyalkyl group. In general, the hydroxyalkyl-bearing product can be produced by culturing the recombinantly produced microorganism or enzyme derived therefrom, capable of selectively hydroxylating a terminal carbon or alkyl, in the presence of a suitable substrate in an aqueous nutrient medium containing sources of assimilable carbon and nitrogen, under submerged aerobic conditions. 
 Suitable epothilones employed as substrate for the method of the present invention may be any such compound having a terminal carbon or terminal alkyl group capable of undergoing the enzymatic hydroxylation of the present invention. The starting material, or substrate, can be isolated from natural sources, such as  Sorangium cellulosum , or they can be synthetically formed epothilones. Other substrates having a terminal carbon or terminal alkyl group capable of undergoing an enzymatic hydroxylation can be employed by the methods herein. For example, compactin can be used as a substrate, which upon hydroxylation forms the compound pravastatin. Methods for hydroxylating compactin to pravastatin via an  Actinomadura  strain are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,423 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,360. 
 For example, using the recombinant microorganisms of the present invention at least one epothilone can be prepared as described in WO 00/39276, U.S. Ser. No. 09/468,854, filed Dec. 21, 1999, the text of which is incorporated herein as if set forth at length. An epothilone of the following Formula I
 
HO—CH 2 -(A 1 ) n -(Q) m -(A 2 ) o -E  (I)
 
where
 
 A 1  and A 2  are independently selected from the group of optionally substituted C 1 –C 3  alkyl and alkenyl; 
 Q is an optionally substituted ring system containing one to three rings and at least one carbon to carbon double bond in at least one ring; 
 n, m, and o are integers selected from the group consisting of zero and 1, where at least one of m or n or o is 1; and 
 E is an epothilone core; can be prepared. 
 This method comprises the steps of contacting at least one epothilone of the following formula II
 
CH 3 -(A 1 ) n -(Q) m -(A 2 ) o -E  (II)
 
 where A 1 , Q, A 2 , E, n, m, and o are defined as above; 
 with a recombinantly produced microorganism, or an enzyme derived therefrom, which is capable of selectively catalyzing the hydroxylation of formula II, and effecting said hydroxylation. 
 In a preferred embodiment, the starting material is epothilone B. Epothilone B can be obtained from the fermentation of  Sorangium cellulosum  So ce90, as described in DE 41 38 042 and WO 93/10121. The strain has been deposited at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen (German Collection of Microorganisms) (DSM) under No. 6773. The process of fermentation is also described in Hofle, G., et al.,  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl ., Vol 35, No. 13/14, 1567–1569 (1996). Epothilone B can also be obtained by chemical means, such as those disclosed by Meng, D., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc ., Vol. 119, No. 42, 10073–10092 (1996); Nicolaou, K., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc ., Vol. 119, No. 34, 7974–7991 (1997) and Schinzer, D., et al.,  Chem. Eur. J ., Vol. 5, No. 9, 2483–2491 (1999). 
 Growth of the recombinantly produced microorganism selected for use in the process may be achieved by one of ordinary skill in the art by the use of appropriate nutrient medium. Appropriate media for the growing of the recombinantly produced microorganisms include those that provide nutrients necessary for the growth of microbial cells. See, for example, T. Nagodawithana and J. M. Wasileski, Chapter 2: “Media Design for Industrial Fermentations,”  Nutritional Requirements of Commercially Important Microorganism , edited by T. W. Nagodawithana and G. Reed, Esteekay Associates, Inc., Milwaukee, Wis., 18–45 (1998); T. L. Miller and B. W. Churchill, Chapter 10: “Substrates for Large-Scale Fermentations,”  Manual of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology , edited by A. L. Demain and N. A. Solomon, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C., 122–136 (1986). A typical medium for growth includes necessary carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and trace elements. Inducers may also be added to the medium. The term inducer as used herein, includes any compound enhancing formation of the desired enzymatic activity within the recombinantly produced microbial cell. Typical inducers as used herein may include solvents used to dissolve substrates, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dioxane, ethanol and acetone. Further, some substrates, such as epothilone B, may also be considered to be inducers. 
 Carbon sources may include sugars such as glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbital, glycerol starch and the like; organic acids such as sodium acetate, sodium citrate, and the like; and alcohols such as ethanol, propanol and the like. Preferred carbon sources include, but are not limited to, glucose, fructose, sucrose, glycerol and starch. 
 Nitrogen sources may include an N-Z amine A, corn steeped liquor, soybean meal, beef extract, yeast extract, tryptone, peptone, cottonseed meal, peanut meal, amino acids such as sodium glutamate and the like, sodium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and the like. 
 Trace elements may include magnesium, manganese, calcium, cobalt, nickel, iron, sodium and potassium salts. Phosphates may also be added in trace or preferably, greater than trace amounts. 
 The medium employed for the fermentation may include more than one carbon or nitrogen source or other nutrient. 
 For growth of the recombinantly produced microorganisms and/or hydroxylation according to the method of the present invention, the pH of the medium is preferably from about 5 to about 8 and the temperature is from about 14° C. to about 37° C., preferably the temperature is 28° C. The duration of the reaction is 1 to 100 hours, preferably 8 to 72 hours. 
 The medium is incubated for a period of time necessary to complete the biotransformation as monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Typically, the period of time needed to complete the transformation is twelve to one hundred hours and preferably about 72 hours after the addition of the substrate. The medium is placed on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Innova 5000) operating at 150 to 300 rpm and preferably about 250 rpm with a throw of 2 inches. 
 The hydroxyalkyl-bearing product can be recovered from the fermentation broth by conventional means that are commonly used for the recovery of other known biologically active substances. Examples of such recovery means include, but are not limited to, isolation and purification by extraction with a conventional solvent, such as ethyl acetate and the like; by pH adjustment; by treatment with a conventional resin, for example, by treatment with an anion or cation exchange resin or a non-ionic adsorption resin; by treatment with a conventional adsorbent, for example, by distillation, by crystallization; or by recrystallization, and the like. 
 The extract obtained above from the biotransformation reaction mixture can be further isolated and purified by column chromatography and analytical thin layer chromatography. 
 The ability of a recombinantly produced microorganism of the present invention to biotransform an epothilone having a terminal alkyl group to an epothilone having a terminal hydroxyalkyl group was demonstrated. In these experiments, a culture comprising a  Streptomyces lividans  clone containing a plasmid with the ebh gene as described in more detail in Example 11 was incubated with an epothilone B suspension for 3 days at 30° with agitation. A sample of the incubate was extracted with an equal volume of 25% methanol: 75% n-butanol, vortexed and allowed to settle for 5 minutes. Two hundred μl of the organic phase was transferred to an HPLC vial and analyzed by HPLC/MS (Example 12). A product peak of epothilone F eluted at a retention time of 15.9 minutes and had a protonated molecular weight of 524. The epothilone B substrate eluted at 19.0 minutes and had a protonated molecular weight of 508. The peak retention times and molecular weights were confirmed using known standards. 
 Rates of biotransformation of epothilone B by cells expressing ebh were also compared to rates of biotransformation by ebh mutants. Cells expressing ebh comprised a frozen spore preparation of.  S. lividans  (pANT849-ebh). Cells expressing mutants comprises frozen spore preparations of  S. lividans  (pANT849-ebh10-53) and  S. lividans  (pANT849-ebh24-16). A frozen spore preparation of  S. lividans  TK24 was used as the control. The cells were pre-incubated for several days at 30° C. Following this pre-incubation, epothilone B in 100% EtOH was added to each culture to a final concentration of 0.05% weight/volume. Samples were then taken at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours with the exception of the  S. lividans  (pANT849-ebh24-16) culture, in which the epothilone B had been completely converted to epothilone F at 48 hours. The samples were analyzed by HPLC. The results are calculated as a percentage of the epothilone B at  time  0 hours.

 The ability of cells expressing ebh to biotransform compactin to pravastatin was also examined. In these experiments, frozen spore preparations of  S. lividans  (pANT849) or  S. lividans  (pANT849-ebh) were grown for several days at 30° C. Following the pre-incubation, an aliquot of each cell culture was transferred to a polypropylene culture tube, compactin was added to each culture tube, and the tubes were incubated for 24 hours, 30° C., 250 rpm. An aliquot of the culture broth was then extracted and compactin and pravastatin values relative to the control  S. lividans  (pANT849) culture were measured via HPLC.

 As discussed supra, mutant ebh25-1 (SEQ ID NO:30) exhibits altered substrate specificity and biotransformation of epothilone B by this mutant resulted in a product with a different HPLC elution time than epothilone B or epothilone F. A sample of this unknown was analyzed by LC-MS and was found to have a molecular weight of 523 (M.W.), consistent with a single hydroxylation of epothilone B. The structure of the biotransformation product was determined as 24-hydroxyl-epothilone B, based on MS and NMR data (compared with data of epothilone B):

 Example 16 
 Construction of Plasmid pPCRscript-ebh 
 A 1.469 kb DNA fragment containing the epothilone B hydroxylase gene and the downstream ferredoxin gene was amplified using PCR. The 50 μl PCR reaction was composed of 5 μl of Taq buffer, 2.5 μl glycerol, 1 μl of 20 ng/μl NPB29-1 plasmid, 0.4 μl of 25 mM dNTPs, 1.0 μl each of primers NPB29-6f (SEQ ID NO:28) and NPB29-7r (SEQ ID NO:29) (5 pmole/μl), 38.1 μl of dH 2 O and 0.5 μl of Taq enzyme (Stratagene).

The PCR product was purified using a Qiagen Qiaquick column with the PCR cleanup procedure. The purified product was digested with BglII and HindIII and purified on a 0.7% agarose gel. A 1.469 kb band was excised from the gel and eluted using a Qiagen Qiaquick gel extraction procedure. The fragments were then cloned into the pPCRscript Amp vector using the PCRscript Amp cloning kit. Colonies containing inserts were picked to 1–2 ml of LB (Luria Broth) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30–37° C., 16–24 hours, 230–300 rpm. Plasmid isolation was performed using the Mo Bio miniplasmid prep kit. The sequence of the insert was confirmed by cycle sequencing with the Big-Dye sequencing kit.

 Example 17 
 Mutagenesis of the ebh Gene for Improved Yield or Altered Specificity 
 The Quikchange® XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit and the Quikchange® Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit, both from Stratagene were used to introduce mutations in the coding region of the ebh gene. Both of these methods employ DNA primers 35–45 bases in length containing the desired mutation (SEQ ID NO:54–59 and 70), a methylated circular plasmid template and PfuTurbo® DNA Polymerase (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,552 and 5,866,395 and 5,948,663) to generate copies of the plasmid template incorporating the mutation carried on the mutagenic primers. Subsequent digestion of the reaction with the restriction endonuclease enzyme DpnI, selectively digests the methylated plasmid template, but leaves the non-methylated mutated plasmid intact. The manufacturer's instructions were followed for all procedures with the exception of the DpnI digestion step in which the incubation time was increased from 1 hr to 3 hrs. The pPCRscript-ebh vector was used as the template for mutagenesis. 
 One to two μl of the reaction was transformed to either XL1-Blue® electrocompetent or XL10-Gold® ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). Cells were plated to a density of greater than 100 colonies per plate on LA (Luria Agar) 100 μg/ml ampicillin plates, and incubated 24–48 hrs at 30–37° C. The entire plate was resuspended in 5 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid was isolated directly from the resuspended cells by centrifuging the cells and then purifying the plasmid using the Mo Bio miniprep procedure. This plasmid was then used as a template for PCR with primers NPB29-6f (SEQ ID NO:28) and NPB29-7r (SEQ ID NO:29) to amplify a mutated expression cassette. Digestion of the 1.469 kb PCR product with the restriction enzymes BglII and HindIII was used to prepare this fragment for ligation to vector pANT849 also digested with BglII and HindIII. Alternatively, the resuspended cells were used to inoculate 20–50 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown 18–24 hrs at 30–37° C. Qiagen midi-preps were performed on the cultures to isolate plasmid DNA containing the desired mutation. Digestion with the restriction enzymes BglII and HindIII was used to excise the mutated expression cassette for ligation to BglII and HindIII digested plasmid pANT849. Screening of mutants was performed in  S. lividans  or  S. rimosus  as described. 
 Alternatively, the method of Leung et al., Technique— A Journal of Methods in Cell and Molecular Biology , Vol. 1, No. 1, 11–15 (1989) was used to generate random mutation libraries of the ebh gene. Manganese and/or reduced dATP concentration is used to control the mutagenesis frequency of the Taq polymerase. The plasmid pCRscript-ebh was digested with NotI to linearize the plasmid. The Polymerase buffer was prepared with 0.166 M (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.67M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 61 mM MgCl 2 , 67 μM EDTA pH8.0, 1.7 mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin). The PCR reaction was prepared with 10 μl of Not I digested pCRscript-ebh (0.1 ng/μl), 10 μl of polymerase buffer, 1.0 μl of 1M β-mercaptoethanol, 10.0 μl of DMSO, 1.0 μl of NPB29-6f (SEQ ID NO:28) primer (100 pmole/μl), 1.0 μl of NPB29-7r (SEQ ID NO:29) primer (100 pmole/μl), 10 μl of 5 mM MnCl 2 , 10.0 μl 10 mM dGTP, 10.0  μl  2 mM dATP, 10 mM dTTp, 10.0 μl Taq polymerase. dH 2 O was added to 100 μl. Reactions were also prepared as described above but without MnCl 2 . The cycling reactions were performed a GeneAmp® PCR system with the following protocol: 95° C. for 1 minute, 55° C. for 30 seconds, 72° C. for 4 minutes), 72° C. for 7 minutes. The PCR reactions were separated on an agarose gel using a Qiagen spin column. The fragments were then digested with BglII and HindIII and purified using a Qiagen spin column. The purified fragments were then ligated to BglII and HindIII digested pANT849 plasmids. Screening of mutants was performed in  S. lividans  and  S. rimousus .

 Biotransformation of Compactin to Pravastatin 
 Twenty ml of R2YE media with 10 μg/ml thiostrepton in a 125 ml flask was inoculated with 200 μl of a frozen spore preparation of  S. lividans  (pANT849),  S. lividans  (pANT849-ebh) and incubated 72 hours at 230 rpm, 28° C. Four ml of culture was inoculated to 20 ml of R2YE media and grown 24 hours at 230 rpm, 28° C. One ml of culture was transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene culture tube, 10 μl of compactin (40 mg/ml) was added to each culture and incubated for 24 hours, 28° C., 250 rpm. Five hundred μl of the culture broth was transferred to a fresh 15 ml polypropylene culture tube. Five hundred μl of 50 mM sodium hydroxide was added and vortexed. Three ml of methanol was added and vortexed, the tube was centrifuged 10 minutes at 3000 rpm in a TJ-6 table-top centrifuge. The organic phase was analyzed by HPLC. Compactin and pravastatin values were assessed relative to the control  S. lividans  (pANT849) culture.

 Example 20 
 High Performance Liquid Chromatography Method for Compactin and Pravastatin Detection 
 The liquid chromatography separation was performed using a Hewlett Packard1090 Series Separation system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif., USA) and a column, 50×46 mm, filled with Spherisorb ODS2,  particle size  5 μM (Keystone Scientific, Inc, Bellefonte, Pa., USA). The gradient mobile phase programming was used with a flow rate of 2.0 ml/minute. Eluent A was water, 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.05% Phosphoric Acid. Eluent B was acetonitrile. The mobile phase was a linear gradient from 20% B to 90% B over 4 minutes. 
 Example 21 
 Structure Determination of the Biotransformation Product of Mutant ebh25-1 
 Analytical HPLC was performed using a Hewlett Packard 1100 Series Liquid Chromatograph with a YMC Packed ODS-AQ column, 4.6 mm i.d.×15  cm  1. A gradient system of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) was used: 20% to 90% B linear gradient, 10 minutes; 90% to 20% linear gradient, 2 minutes. The flow rate was 1 ml/minute and UV detection was at 254 nm. 
 Preparative HPLC was performed using the following equipment and conditions:
     Pump: Varian ProStar Solvent Delivery Module (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., USA). Detector: Gynkotek UVD340S.   Column: YMC ODS-A column (30 mmID×100 mm length, 5μ particle size).   Elution flow rate: 30 ml/minute   Elution gradient: (solvent A: water; solvent B: acetonitrile), 20% B, 2 minutes; 20% to 60% B linear gradient, 18 minutes; 60% B, 2 minutes; 60% to 90% B linear gradient, 1 minute; 90% B, 3 minutes; 90% to 20% B linear gradient, 2 minutes.   Detection: UV, 210 nm.   
 LC/NMR was performed as follows: 40 μl of sample was injected onto a YMC Packed ODS-AQ column (4.6 mm i.d.×15 cm 1). The column was eluted at 1 ml/minute flow rate with a gradient system of D 2 O (solvent A) and acetonitrile-d 3  (solvent B): 30% B, 1 minute; 30% to 80% B linear gradient, 11 minutes. The eluent passed a UV detection cell (monitored at 254 nm) before flowing through a F19/H 1 NMR probe (60 μl active volume) in Varian AS-600 NMR spectrometer. The biotransformation product was eluted at around 7.5 minutes and the flow was stopped manually to allow the eluent to remain in the NMR probe for NMR data acquisition. 
 Isolation and analysis was performed as follows. The butanol/methanol extract (about 10 ml) was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen stream. One ml methanol was added to the residue (38 mg) and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13000 rpm, 2 min). 0.1 ml of the supernatant was used for LC/NMR study and the rest of 0.9 ml was subjected to the preparative HPLC (0.2–0.4 ml per injection). Two major peaks were observed and collected: peak A was eluted between 14 and 15 minutes, while peak B was eluted between 16.5 and 17.5 minutes. Analytical HPLC analysis indicated that peak B was the parent compound, epothilone B (Rt 8.5 minutes), and peak A was the biotransformation product (Rt 7.3 minutes). The peak A fractions were pooled and MS analysis data was obtained with the pooled fractions. The pooled fraction was evaporated to a small volume, then was lyophilized to give 3 mg of white solid. NMR and HPLC analysis of the white solid (dissolved in methanol) revealed that the biotransformation product was partially decomposed during the drying process.
