 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to a kind of microorganism of useful amino acids production power enhancing and utilize it to produce the amino acid whose method of L-, cause cytoactive to improve due to reducing power increase and shorten the cell cultures time. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Known microorganisms produces useful products by fermentative action, needs a large amount of energy, as ATP (ATP) or reducing power, as NADPH (Triphosphopyridine nucleotide, reduced), to strengthen its biosynthetic pathway. 
 In the metabolic process of microorganism, the NADH (Reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide) that decomposition reaction is used and building-up reactions NADPH (Triphosphopyridine nucleotide, reduced) used the two be very important in intracellular balance.This balance is controlled by the dephosphorylation of the NAD phosphorylation shown in following formula or NADP. 
 NAD
         + +ATP→NADP
         + +ADP
       
 NADP
         + → NAD
         + + phosphoric acid salt
       
 In intestinal bacteria (E.coli), the phosphorylation of known NAD is by NAD kinases (EC2.7.1.23) catalysis of nadK (or yfjB) genes encoding.NAD kinases utilizes Mg
         2+ as the cofactor of enzyme reaction, and suppressed by the other structure of NADPH and NADH.Existing known NAD
         + km value be 2000 μMs, the Km value of ATP is 2500 μMs (Eur.J.Biochem., (2001) 268:4359-4365).
       
 Although it has obvious importance in pathways metabolism, but, little to the dephosphorylized research of NADP.Although the NAD kinase homolog of Archimycetes Methanococcus jannaschii (Methanococcusjannaschii), verified have NADP phosphatase activity, but in eukaryote and eubacterium, still do not identify the gene that coding has the enzyme of this kind of activity.In intestinal bacteria, the product of cysQ gene demonstrates high NADP and NADPH phosphatase activity, but the dynamics research of the enzyme of purifying shows, it is not the real NADP Phosphoric acid esterase (BiochemJ. of described organism, (2007) 402:205-218, Biosci.Biotechnol.Biochem., (2008) 72:919-930). 
 In many microorganisms, found NAD kinase activity, the NAD-binding site significant to catalytic activity and the kinase whose avtive spot of NAD show the aminoacid sequence of high conservative between species.Such as, various microorganism, comprise gram-positive microorganism, be all presented in the Tertiary structure predictions of spiral 2,4 and 5 (it represents with H2, H4 and H5 separately) homology (ApplMicrobiolBiotechnol (2010) 87:583-593) demonstrating height. 
 The NADP that NAD kinases produces finally provides reducing power, in intestinal bacteria, particularly produce the NADP needed for useful products in a large number
         + / NADPH is the essential element (BiochemJ., (2007) 402:205-218) of anabolic reaction.In intestinal bacteria, NADPH is mainly through producing with under type: 1) be oxidized phosphopentose pathway, 2) the NADP dependency isocitric enzyme (icd gene) in TCA circulation, and 3) transhydrogenase (pntAB gene) (JBiolChem., (2004) 279:6613-6619).
       
 These reactions use NADP to produce NADPH as substrate, thus increase the level of NADPH by the Intracellular levels increasing NADP.Therefore, in order to the suitability for industrialized production of various metabolic substd, the Intracellular levels increasing NADP many trials have been done, as, 1) NADPH and thymidine output (BiotechnolLett. is increased by overexpression nadK in intestinal bacteria, (2009) 31:19291936), 2) output (ApplMicrobiolBiotechnol. of NADPH and PHB (poly butyric ester) is increased by overexpression nadK in intestinal bacteria, (2009) 83:939947), and 3) similar to overexpression nadK in intestinal bacteria, lysine production is increased by overexpression ppnK in coryneform bacteria (Corynebacterium).The key point of more than attempting is the expression increasing nadK gene.But in either event, also must increase the source of phosphoric acid of such as ATP, increase reducing power with the level by increasing NADPH, it comes from the NADP level increased by the kinase whose high expression level of NAD. 
 In microorganism, ATP produces mainly through electron transfer system or substrate level phosphorylation.The ATP produced provides energy by being decomposed into cell, is also regenerated by glycolysis reaction or oxidative phosphorylation reaction.True based on this, be studied bacterial ATP regeneration system rapidly is applied in production process, to provide energy (BiosciBiotechnolBiochem., (1997) 61:840-845) in a large amount of production processes of useful products.But, as mentioned above, about the research increasing source of phosphoric acid method is little, and increase source of phosphoric acid and increase reducing power by the kinase whose high expression level of NAD and increase subsequently needed for biosynthetic products.In addition, in cell supplying energy, to increase the research of energy supply little by producing ATP in a large number, and the research that utilizes ATP as source of phosphoric acid in correlation technique, is not carried out yet.

 As shown in table 10, when only tehB genetically deficient, sucrose assimilative capacity is similar to parent strain.But when NAD kinase activity strengthens, sucrose assimilative capacity adds 2g nearly than parent strain. 
 In addition, when tehB genetically deficient, cell density decreases 6% nearly compared with parent strain, but its production amount of threonine is but suitable with parent strain.But when to import described two sudden changes simultaneously, compared with parent strain, cell density decreases 8% nearly, sucrose assimilative capacity adds 8% nearly, and production amount of threonine too increases 9% simultaneously. 
 In addition, use glucose as carbon source, by titration detect embodiment 3 recombination bacillus coli KCCM10541 Δ tehBnadK2 copy bacterial strain, parent strain intestinal bacteria KCCM10541, and comparative example 1 and 2 prepare KCCM10541 Δ tehB bacterial strain and KCCM10541nadK2 copy bacterial strain.Each had the bacterial strain of different inherited character in 33 DEG C of constant incubators in LB solid medium, overnight incubation.After this, by the strain inoculation of a platinum loop in the 25ml titration substratum containing the glucose shown in table 11, and 33 DEG C, cultivate 48 hours under 200rpm.Result is as shown in table 10.All results represent with the mean value obtained from three flasks.

 KCCM10541 Δ tehBnadK2 copies bacterial strain and is named as CA03-448, namely has glucose assimilative capacity and the product L-threonine coli strain that NAD kinase activity strengthens and tehB lacks; And KCCM10541 Δ tehBnadK2 copy/pAcscBAR '-mak bacterial strain, the KCCM10541 Δ tehBnadK2 providing sucrose assimilative capacity copies bacterial strain, is named as CA03-449.Above-mentioned bacterial strains be stored in International Depository Authority Korean Culture Center (, KoreanCultureCneterofMicroorganisms, be positioned at 361-221, Hongje-1-dong, Seodaemon-gu, Seoul, Korea), it is attached cultivation depositary institution of culture presevation federation of Korea S (SubsidiaryCultureCollectionoftheKoreanFederationofCultur eCollections), preservation date is on January 10th, 2011, and deposit number is respectively KCCM11167P and KCCM11168P. 
 The titration of the product L-Trp bacterial strain that the enzyme deactivation of experimental example 2.tehB genes encoding and NAD kinase activity strengthen 
 With glucose as carbon source, by titration detect embodiment 4 recombination bacillus coli KCCM10812 Δ tehBnadK2 copy bacterial strain, parent strain intestinal bacteria KCCM10812, and comparative example 1 and 2 prepare KCCM10812 Δ tehB bacterial strain and KCCM10812nadK2 copy bacterial strain. 
 In order to titration, a platinum loop strain inoculation is incubated at LB solid medium, spends the night.Then, by strain inoculation described in a platinum loop in the 25ml flask titration substratum with component shown in table 13, then 33 DEG C, cultivate 48 hours under 200rpm.Result is as shown in table 14.All results represent with the mean value obtained from three flasks.

 As shown in table 14, when tehB genetically deficient, cell density adds 10% nearly compared with parent strain.When NAD kinase activity strengthens, glucose assimilative capacity improves, but tryptophane output is compared with parent strain and indifference. 
 But when to import two sudden changes simultaneously, compared with parent strain, cell density increases, and glucose assimilative capacity improves, tryptophane productivity adds 14% nearly simultaneously.
