    [0001]
     The present invention relates to novel temperature promoters and set of expression vectors isolated from  Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  The vectors so developed can be used for regulated expression of proteins, both homologous and heterologous, very efficiently and economically. 
   
 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
   
    
    [0002]
     Early search for new promoters in  S. pombe  yielded  adh 1, a strong but constitutive promoter, which drives the expression of the glycolytic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. This promoter has been used in the vectors pART1 and pEVP11 ( Russell, 1989, In: Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. San Diego: Academic Press, Inc. Nasim. A., Young, P., and Johnson, B.F., Eds. pp. 243-71 ). Among the inducible promoters are the glucose regulated promoter fructose bisphosphase ( fbp ) ( Hoffman and Winston, 1989, Gene 84: 473-79 ) and the invertase promoter ( inv 1) ( Tanaka et al., 1998, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 245: 246-53 ), which have been used successfully to express a number of proteins including GFP. The strongest known promoter in  S. pombe  is  adh 1, which is a constitutively expressed promoter. Although expression driven by this promoter can yield levels of protein to the extent of 0.5-2% of total cellular protein ( Russell, 1989, In Molecular Biology of the Fission Yeast. San Diego: Academic Press, Inc. Nasim. A., Young, P., and Johnson, B.F., Eds. pp. 243-271 ), it can pose difficulties when the expression of toxic proteins is desired. Therefore, researchers have always focused their attention to the development of inducible promoters. 
     
    
    [0003]
     The regulatable promoters in  S. pombe  include the  fbp, inv 1 and  nmt 1. The  fbp 1 promoter is repressed by 8% glucose and derepressed in 0.1% glucose plus 3% maltose ( Hoffman and Winston, 1989, Gene 84: 473-479 ). A limitation of this promoter is that it is derepressed in stationary phase and furthermore, the cells expressing the vector do not grow well under the inducing conditions. A similar drawback is faced by the  inv 1 promoter derived from the  inv 1 gene that codes for invertase in  S. pombe  ( Tanaka et al., 1998, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 245: 246-53 ). It is also repressed by glucose and derepressed by depletion of glucose. The regulation of expression using this promoter cannot be very tight because of progressive depletion of glucose in the culture medium as a result of its utilization during the cellular growth. Likewise another inducible promoter of  S. pombe  acid phosphatase structural gene ( pho 1), which is induced by low concentrations of inorganic phosphate in the medium, has the drawback that it shows a significant level of uninduced transcription, thus negating its potential use as a promoter ( Maundrell, 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 10857-64 ). Thus, till date only one promoter element has come to be used regularly as a research tool, namely  nmt 1, which is repressed by high concentration of thiamin and induced by absence of thiamin ( Maundrell, 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 10857-64 ). The most common and the strongest form of this promoter is  nmt 1. A few derivatives of the  nmt 1 promoter were subsequently developed that yield very high ( nmt 1 ) , medium ( nmt 41) and low ( nmt 81) levels of expression ( Forsburg, 1993, Nucleic Acid Res. 21: 2955-56 ). A related problem of these promoters is their leakiness even under repressed conditions and the leakiness appears to be directly proportional to the promoter strength ( Forsburg, 1993, Nucleic Acid Res. 21: 2955-2956 ). The induction regime involves growth of cells harboring the plasmid expressing a particular gene under the control of the  nmt 1 promoter in presence of thiamin. After growing to early log phase (OD 600  of ∼0.3), cells are washed with and transferred to a synthetic medium lacking thiamin and grown further. The expression of the gene of interest is observed after nearly 18-20 hours of growth in the medium lacking thiamin. Apart from the cumbersome problem of handling cells under sterile conditions through the steps of washing and resuspension in thiamin-free medium, the other major problem with this promoter is that it is leaky, that is, the expression of the gene is never completely repressed in the presence of thiamin. This can lead to a deleterious effect on the growth rate of cells even before the start of induction because of possible metabolic load. A similar effect may be exerted during induction because of the long time of induction to achieve full expression level. The presence of the heterologous protein during the long induction period in the intracellular milieu may also lead to cellular defect and protein degradation. The present invention therefore obviates these drawbacks and through the process of this invention a temperature sensitive (or regulated) promoter based vector for expression of heterologous proteins in fission yeast,  Schizosaccharomyces pombe  has been developed. This invention is particularly useful in efficient, economic and regulated expression of proteins both homologous and heterologous. 
     
    
    [0004]
     The new promoter elements are isolated by screening of promoters which allow expression of a Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene in response to a shift in temperature. The promoter elements thus isolated represent a truncated region of the previously reported no-message for thiamine 1 ( nmt 1) promoter ( Maundrell, 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 10857-64 ) having some unique properties that make them more advantageous to use as compared to other known promoters including  nmt 1 in  Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) . These characteristics are: i) temperature sensitive expression: induction of expression by shifting the temperature from 36°C to 25°C, ii) faster kinetics of expression, iii) moderate level of expression, iv) low leaky expression and v) lack of toxicity. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Selection of a suitable promoter is the most important factor in obtaining optimum level of expression. In early studies, several promoters that work in  Saccharromyces cerevisiae  ( S. cerevisiae ) were tried in S.  pombe,  but with limited success. The promoters that provided a good level of expression included phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ), alcohol dehydrogenase I ( ADH 1) and iso-1-cytochrome c ( CYC) . Among other heterologous promoters that work in  S. pombe  are the simian virus (SV40) promoter, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter, cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, tomato nitrate reductase promoter, human serum albumin TATA element,  adenovirus region  3 promoter, human immunodeficiency virus-1 Long terminal repeat (HIV-1 LTR) promoter etc. Another expression system combines the CaMV promoter and tetracycline regulatory sequences to elicit tetracycline regulated expression. Recently, a co-transformation strategy using a vector containing the hCMV promoter and another vector containing the autonomous replication sequence ( ars 1) and stable (stb) elements has been reported {review by  Giga-Hama, 1997, in Foreign Gene Expression in Fission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Giga-Hamma and Kumagai, Eds.), Springer-Verlag, Berlin pp. 3-28 }. 
     
    
    [0006]
     The advantages of the new promoters vis-a-vis the nmt1 and its other known derivative promoters strongly support the aspects of novelty and lack of obviousness and anticipation. In fact, literature published on the characteristics of the mnt1 promoters have only focussed on the minimal size of the nmt1 promoters that is repressible by thiamin and on the role of trans-acting factors. No investigation has envisaged or anticipated in published literature whether derivatives of the nmt1 promoter having altogether new characteristics different from the original parent promoter could be derived. In fact, from our screen we were expecting to isolate heat-inducible promoters, like heat shock promoters, rather than the temperature sensitive ones that we actually obtained. Thus, identification of promoter that is heat sensitive, was an unexpected discovery for us as well. Therefore, we believe, that these points will strengthen the claims for lack of obviousness and anticipation in obtaining the present set of promoters.

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 
   
    
    [0014]
     The process of the present invention involves construction of a genomic library of  S. pombe  upstream of the GFP-reporter gene in a suitable vector that contains the  ars 1 element and the  S. cerevisiae  β-isopropylmalate dehydogenase ( LEU2 ) or the  S. pombe  orotidinephosphate decarboxylase  ura 4 gene as a selectable marker, and plating this library on appropriate media containing different metal salts or monovalent salts as inducers or growth at different ambient temperatures. The expression of GFP was monitored by exposure to UV light and the putative clones expressing GFP were subjected to more careful screening. From an extensive search, two promoter elements were isolated that allowed expression of the GFP reporter gene at 25°C but not at 36°C. 
   
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 
   
    
    [0015]
     The advantages of the new promoters vis-a-vis the nmt1 and its other known derivative promoters strongly support the aspects of novelty and lack of obviousness and anticipation. In fact, literature published on the characteristics of the nmt1 promoters have only focussed on the minimal size of the nmt1 promoters that is repressible by thiamin and on the role of trans-acting factors. No investigation has envisaged or anticipated in published literature whether derivatives of the nmt1 promoter having altogether new characteristics different from the original parent promoter could be derived. In fact, from our screen we were expecting to isolate heat-inducible promoters, like heat shock promoters, rather than the temperature sensitive ones that we actually obtained. Thus, identification of promoter that is heat sensitive, was an unexpected discovery for us as well. Therefore, we believe that these points will strengthen the claims for lack of obviousness and anticipation in obtaining the present set of promoters. 
     
    
    [0016]
     For construction of the genomic library, genomic DNA was isolated from wild type  S. pombe  strain having no known auxotrophic markers. Partial digestion of the genomic DNA was carried out with  Sau3AI,  to obtain maximum amount of DNA in the range of 100 bp to 2000 bp. The  Sau3AI  digested genomic DNA was ligated to the unique  Bam HI site in the vector pGFP (without  nmt 1 promoter) as per the standard procedure. 
     
    
    [0017]
     The above  S. pombe  'promoter' library with GFP reporter was transformed into an  S. pombe  strain according to the published procedure of Gietz  et.al.,  1992,  Nucleic acids Research  20(6) : 1425. The yeast transformants were replica plated on PMA-leu plates containing different concentration of glucose, galactose, sodium chloride, copper and zinc. The same transformants were also replica plated on to PMA-leu plate in triplicate and incubated at different temperatures. Expression was followed under the different conditions by directly monitoring the green fluorescence of colonies when exposed to UV. 
     
    
    [0018]
     Two clones were isolated from the above screen that exhibited enhanced expression of GFP at 25°C and no expression at 36°C, as monitored by green fluorescence when exposed to the UV light. 
     
    
    [0019]
     Automatic DNA sequencer ( PE  Applied Biosystems ABI 310) was used for sequencing of these clones. The DNA samples were processed for sequencing according to ABI Prism BigDye Terminator protocol ( PE  Applied Biosystems). The clones yielded sequences of 185 and 146 bases and, therefore, the new promoters were named as  nmt-185  ( Fig. 1 ) and  mnt-146  ( Fig. 2 ), respectively. 
     
    
    [0020]
     A new vector pJRK2 (Accession no. MTCC 5106) was designed in which the  nmt-185  promoter was cloned between the sites  Hind III and  Pst I, followed by multiple cloning sites (MCS) including  Sal I,  Xho I,  Bam HI,  Sma I and  Sac I ,  into which other genes of interest could be cloned ( Fig. 3 ). 
     
    
    [0021]
     Another new vector pJRK3 (Accession no. MTCC 5107) was designed in which the  nmt-146  promoter was cloned between the sites  Hin dIII and  Pst I, followed by multiple cloning sites (MCS) including  Sal I,  Xho I,  Bam HI,  Sma I and  Sac I, into which other genes of interest could be cloned ( Fig. 4 ). 
     
    
    [0022]
     Because the new promoters show 100% homology with  mnt1  gene of  S. pombe,  experiments were carried out to check whether conditions of repression and expression by the new promoters are similar to or different from those with  nmt1  and to compare the strength as well as time of induction, using  gfp -gene as a reporter gene. To compare the conditions of expression and repression of  nmt-185, nmt-146  and  mnt1  promoters, pGFP plasmids containing  nmt-185, nmt-146  or  nmt1  promoters were transformed into a wild type strain of  S .  pombe.  GFP expression was monitored in the presence and absence of thiamine at 36°C and 25°C. It was observed that  mnt1, nmt-146  and  nmt-185  promoters were repressed in presence of thiamine at 36°C as monitored by green fluorescence. However, in absence of thiamine at 36°C, while  nmt1  promoter was derepressed, i.e., GFP gave green fluorescence, the  nmt-185  and  nmt-146  promoter remained repressed, i.e., GFP gene gave no green fluorescence. On the other hand at 25°C,  nmt1, nmt-185  and  nmt-146  were expressed as indicated by green fluorescence. When grown in absence of thiamine. But in presence of thiamine all three promoters were again repressed. Thus, the  nmt-185  and  nmt-146  promoters can be regulated by a temperature shift: they are repressed at 36°C, but expressed upon shift to 25°C in absence of thiamine. In contrast, the  nmt 1 promoter is equally expressed at 36°C and 25°C in absence of thiamine 
     
    
    [0023]
     A wild type strain of  S. pombe  carrying the clone for new promoters ( nmt-185  and  nmt-146 ) upstream of GFP gene was grown in YEA medium at 33-37°C. Overnight cultures were reinnoculated into YEA media and grown further at 33-37°C to mid-log phase. They were washed thrice with sterile water, resuspended in PMA-leu media and grown further at 22-28°C for 1-5-hrs. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in sterile water, and fixed by suspending in water, after which it was diluted with ethanol and stored at low temperature indefinitely. The fixed cells were harvested for analysis by centrifugation, washed with water and resuspended in 50mM sodium acetate. Cells suspensions were sonicated briefly and analyzed using a FACSorting apparatus and data of fluorescence (FL1) plotted against forward scatter (FSC) or count against fluorescence (FL1). 
     
    
    [0024]
     Other genes, like β-galactosidase, Streptokinase from  S. equisimilis  and  cdc18  from  S. pombe  were cloned in front of the new promoter element  nmt-185  in the new vector pJRK2 (Accession no. MTCC 5106) ( Fig. 3 ) and their expression was also monitored. 
     
    
    [0025]
     Other genes, like β-galactosidase, Streptokinase from  S. equisimilis  were also cloned in front of the new promoter element  nmt-146  in the new vector pJRK3 (Accession no. MTCC 5107) ( Fig. 4 ) and their expression was also monitored. 
     
    
    [0026]
     Assay for β-galactosidase activity was carried out as described by  Davenport et al., 1999 Genetics 153: 1091-1103 . 
     
    
    [0027]
     Samples were withdrawn from cells expressing the  cdc 18 gene under the control of the  nmt- 185 promoter at different time points of induction and examined under the Phase-contrast microscope. 
     
    
    [0028]
     Wild type cells harboring the Streptokinase gene under the control of  nmt-185  or  nmt-146  promoters were grown in YEA medium upto mid-log phase and then inoculated into synthetic PMA medium lacking uracil to start the induction of SK expression. Samples were collected after different times of induction. To obtain cell extracts the harvested cells were washed once with chilled water and then with Buffer A (0.02M Hepes, pH 
     
    
    [0029]
     7.5, 0.1M Sodium chloride, 0.002M EDTA, 0.625% glycerol and 1mM β-mercaptoethanol). The cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing protease inhibitors. An equal weight of acid-washed glass beads was added and cells broken by vortexing at 4°C. Each one min cycle of vortexing was followed by 30 sec incubation on ice till 80% lysis occurred. Cells lysate was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4°C in TL-100-3 rotor of TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant (cell extract) was saved and stored at -70°C for further analysis. 
     
    
    [0030]
     Biologically active SK was quantitated as described by  Jackson et al.,1981, Methods Enzymol. 80: 387-394 .

     The process of the present invention is illustrated in the examples given below which should not, however, be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. 
   
 EXAMPLES 
 
   Example 1:  Isolation of Promoter elements 
   
    
    [0054]
     For search of promoters, a genomic library was constructed. For this, genomic DNA was isolated from wild type  S. pombe  strain having no known auxotrophic markers. Partial digestion of the genomic DNA was carried out with  Sau3AI,  to obtained maximum amount of DNA in the range of 100 bp to 2000 bp. The  Sau3AI  digested genomic DNA was ligated to the unique  Bam HI site in the vector pGFP (without promoter). 
     
    
    [0055]
     The above  S. pombe  'promoter' library with GFP reporter was transformed into  S. pombe  strain. The yeast transformants were replica plated on PMA-leu plates containing different concentration of glucose, galactose, sodium chloride, copper and zinc. The same transformants were also replica plated on to PMA-leu plate in triplicate and incubated at different temperatures. Expression was followed under the different conditions by directly monitoring the green fluorescence of colonies when exposed to UV. 
     
    
    [0056]
     Two clones were isolated from the above screen that exhibited enhanced expression of GFP at 25°C and no expression at 36°C, as monitored by green fluorescence when exposed to the UV light. 
     
    
    [0057]
     Automatic DNA sequencer ( PE  Applied Biosystems ABI 310) was used for sequencing of these clones. The DNA samples were processed for sequencing according to ABI Prism BigDye Terminator protocol ( PE  Appied Biosystems). The clones yielded sequences of 185 and 146 bases and, therefore, the new promoters were named as  nmt-185  ( Fig. 1 ) and  nmt-146  ( Fig. 1 ), respectively. 
     
    
    [0058]
     A new vector (Accession no. MTCC 5106) was designed in which the  nmt-185  promoter was cloned between the sites  Hind III and  Pst I, followed by multiple cloning sites (MCS) including  Sal I , -Xho I,  Bam HI , Sma I and  Sac I, into which other genes of interest could be cloned ( Fig. 2 ). 
     
    
    [0059]
     Another new vector (Accession no. MTCC 5107) was designed in which the  mnt-146  promoter was cloned between the sites  Hin dIII and  Pst I, followed by multiple cloning sites (MCS) including  Sal I , Xho I,  Bam HI,  Sma I and  Sac I ,  into which other genes of interest could be cloned ( Fig. 3 ). 
     
    
    [0060]
     Both these vectors were deposited in International Depository Authority on Microbial Type Culture Collection and have given accession nos. MTCC 5106 and 5107 respectively. 
     Example 2 :  Expression of GFP by nmt-185 promoter 
   
    
    [0061]
     To monitor the expression level induced by the new promoter element, the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was cloned in the MCS of the vector pJRK2 (Accession no. MTCC 5106) ( Fig.3 ). The same gene was also cloned in front of the  nmt1  promoter for comparison of level of expression. Flow cytometry analysis was used to quantify the amount of GFP protein expressed under the control of  mnt-185  at different time intervals of induction. As yeast cells have some background autofluorescence when irradiated at 488 nm, the fluorescence profile of  S. pombe  strain having control vector was analyzed first.  S. pombe  cells were grown to mid-exponential phase in rich medium under repressed conditions (36°C) and then shifted to expressed condition in a selective medium (25°C). Samples were taken at 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 15 hours of induction and the fluorescence profile of 10,000 cells analyzed. In case of the  mnt-185  promoter, the fluorescence signal was maximum after a 3 hr period of induction, followed by a decrease with further increase in time of induction. 
     
    
    [0062]
     The study of the present shows that nmt-185 promoter also gives maximum GFP expression after 3 hours of induction, while nmt1 promoter does so only after 15 hours of induction. Furthermore, the level of expression appears to be similar in both cases as indicated by similar fraction of cells expressing GFP by both the promoters (   Figures 4 to 6     ; Table 1 ).

     Example 3:  Expression of cdc18 gene of  S .  pombe  by nmt-185 promoter 
   
    
    [0063]
     The new promoter element  nmt -185 isolated from the promoter screen was also used to monitor the expression of cell division cycle gene  cdc18  from  S. pombe.  Overproduction of  cdc 18 has been shown to cause delay in mitosis and more than one round of DNA synthesis leading to a drastic elongation of cells. In the present example expression of  cdc18   +  gene was carried out under the control of  nmt-185  promoter. 
     
    
    [0064]
     The  cdc18  gene was cloned into the multiple cloning sequence (MCS) of the vector pJRK2 (Accession no. MTCC 5106) and transformed in to a wild type strain of S.  pombe.  Similarly, the  cdc18  gene was also cloned in front of the  nmt1  promoter. Cells were grown to exponential phase in medium containing thiamine (promoter off) at 36°C, washed extensively and transferred to fresh media without thiamine at 25°C (promoter on) to induce the expression of  cdc18.  Samples were withdrawn after 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 15 hours of induction and examined under the Phase-contrast microscope. In case of  nmt-185  promoter, cells start becoming elongated after 2 hrs of induction and achieved maximum elongation after 3 hrs. Further, see the data for expression of cdc18 by nmt1 and nmt-185 promoters in and  Figs. 7  and  8 , respectively. These data also indicate that maximum effect of overexpression of cdc18, visualized as fraction of elongated cells, is achieved by 3 hours with nmt-185 promoter ( Fig. 7 ), while it takes 15-18 hours when expressed under the control of nmt1 promoter ( Fig. 7 ) 
     Example 4:  Expression of β-galactosidase by the nmt-185 promoter 
   
    
    [0065]
     The  Pst I -Xho I fragment containing the  nmt -185 promoter was cloned into the  Pst I and  Xho I sites of the vector pREP3X-  lacZ  in place of the  nmt1  promoter ( Maundrell, 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 10857-10864 ). Thus, the  lacZ  gene was expressed under control of  nmt-185  promoter and the β-galactosidase activity monitored at 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 15 hours of induction using ONPG as substrate. Activity was maximum after 3hrs of induction in case of  nmt-185  promoter. The  nmt-185  promoter induced β-galactosidase by approximately 25-fold. See comparison of expression of (5-galactosidase by pREPS, pREP41, pREP81 and pREP-185 in Tables 2 and 3. The data show that pREP-185 promoter allows expression at the same level as that shown by the promoter pREP41, i.e., moderate level of expression. Furthermore, it shows a similarly low level of leaky expression as pREP41 under repressed condition. However, the nmt-185 promoter is better than even nmt1, which is the strongest version of nmt promoter, in that it shows maximum expression after only 3 hours of induction (Table 3), while nmt1 gives maximum expression only after 15 hours of induction.

     Example 5:  Expression of Streptokinase by the nmt-185 promoter 
   
    
    [0066]
     To check whether a heterologous gene can be expressed by the new promoter, a chimeric gene construct comprising a fusion between the Plus pheromone signal sequence of  S .  pombe  and the mature SK was cloned in front of the  nmt-185  promoter in the vector pJRK2 (Accession no. MTCC 5106). The cloned plasmid was transformed into a wild type strain of  S .  pombe  and the transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy at 37°C. To assess the level of SK activity, plasminogen clearing plate assay was performed by replica plating, overlaying with skim milk-agarose containing plasminogen and incubating at 25°C. After 4 hrs, the transformants harboring the plasmid expressing SK gene produced a clear zone. Thus, the recombinant plasmid harboring the Streptokinase gene under the control of  nmt-185  promoter also expresses SK activity in  S. pombe.   
     
    
    [0067]
     To obtain the optimum conditions for expression using the new promoter, wild type cells expressing the recombinant plasmid pJRK2 (accession no. MTCC 5106) containing the chimeric Plus- factor-SK fusion gene were grown in YEA medium at 37°C upto mid-log phase and then inoculated into synthetic PMA medium lacking uracil at 25°C to start the induction of SK expression. Samples were collected after 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hrs of induction. At the same time points culture supernatants were also collected and concentrated. No SK activity was observed in supernatant. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with anti-SK antibody. One band of 47kDa corresponding to mature SK could be observed. SK activity in the extract was quantitated using chromozyme substrate and maximum level of specific activity of 870 I.U./mg protein was observed after 3 hrs of induction. The activity decreased significantly after 4 hrs of induction and no activity could be detected after 6 and 8 hrs of induction. No activity could be detected in the culture supernatant at any time point. The data for expression of streptokinase by nmt1 in    Fig. 9    and that by nmt-185 promoter in    Fig. 10    and the comparison of the maximum activities using the two promoters and the time of induction in  Table 4.  These data again show that nmt-185 promoter yields maximum expression of SK within 3 hours of induction, as compared with 15 hours required by the nmt1 promoter  (Table 5).   
     
    
    [0068]
     Although nmtl remains expressed over a wide temperature range, its benefit is counterbalanced because of the long induction period, toxicity, metabolic load and cumbersome handling required to remove the represser (thiamin) by repeated washings. On the other hand in case of the new promoters, the induction step involving reducing the temperature from 36°C to 25°C is operationally easy to perform, without a change of medium. Along with other advantages, like reduced induction period (from 15hrs with nmt1 to 3 hours with nmt185/nmt146), no effect on growth rate and reduced level of toxicity and proteolysis, possibly because of the reduced time of exposure of the expressed protein, makes the new promoters much more advantageous to use (This has been discussed as below). 
     
    
    [0069]
     The inventors have performed experiments to compare the growth rates of cultures expressing Streptokinase (SK) under the control of nmt1 and nmt185 promoters and find that while in the case of nmt1 -induced expression there is 50% reduction in growth rate accompanying the induction of SK expression (compare    Figure 11    with    Figure 9   ), there is no effect on growth when SK was expressed under the control of nmt185 (Compare    Figure 11    with    Figure 10   ). The    Figure 11    is suggesting lack of toxicity and/or reduction of growth rate while using nmt-185 promoter in contrast with nmt1 promoter. 
     
    
    [0070]
     Likewise, while significant level of proteolysis of SK is observed in the periplasmic fraction of cells expressing SK under the control of nmt1 promoter, less than 5% proteolysis of SK was observed in the periplasmic fraction of cells expressing SK under the control of nmt185 promoter. Thus, expression with the nmt-185 promoter results in very much reduced proteolysis in the periplasmic fraction as compared to expression by the nmt1 promoter, which may be due to reduced time of exposure of protein .to the extracellular or periplasmic proteases. This data is shown in  Figure  12     .

     Example 6:  Expression of β-galactosidase by the nmt-146 promoter 
   
    
    [0071]
     The  Pst I -Xho I fragment containing the  nmt -146 promoter was cloned into the  Pst I and  Xho I sites of the vector (pREP3X- lac Z) in place of the  nmt1  promoter ( Maundrell, 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 10857-10864 ). Thus, the  lacZ gene  was expressed under control of  nmt-146  promoter and the β-galactosidase activity monitored at 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 15 hours of induction using ONPG as substrate. Activity was maximum after 3hrs of induction in case of  nmt-146  promoter. Like  nmt-185,  the  nmt-146  promoter also induced β-galactosidase by approximately 25-fold. 
     Example 7:  Expression of Streptolcinase by the nmt-146 promoter 
   
    
    [0072]
     To check whether a heterologous gene can be expressed by the new promoter, a chimeric gene construct comprising a fusion between the Plus pheromone signal sequence of  S. pombe  and the mature SK was cloned in front of the  nmt-146  promoter in the vector pJRK3 (Accession no. MTCC 5107)( Fig. 4 ). The cloned plasmid was transformed into a wild type strain of  S .  pombe  and the transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy at 37°C. To assess the level of SK activity, plasminogen clearing plate assay was performed by replica plating, overlaying with skim milk-agarose containing plasminogen and incubating at 25°C. After 4 hrs, the transformants harboring the plasmid expressing SK gene produced a clear zone. Thus, the recombinant plasmid harboring the Streptokinase gene under the control of  nmt-146  promoter also expresses SK activity in  S. pombe  at levels similar to those obtained with the  nmt-185  promoter. 
   
 THE ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW PROMOTERS NMT-185 AND NMT1-46 
 
   
    
    [0073]
     
     
 ➢  Faster induction kinetics of the nmt-185 and nmt-146 promoters as compared to the nmt1 promoter:  The  nmt 1 promoter provides maximum expression level after 18-20 hours of induction, while the  mnt-185  and  nmt-146  do so within 3. hours of induction- thus providing a 5-6 fold faster rate of induction than the  nmt 1 promoter. 
 ➢  this minimizes the problem of metabolic load.  The faster kinetics of induction in case of the  mint-185  and  mnt-146  promoters has another advantage that maximum level of expression of protein is achieved within less than one generation (5 hours), obivating the posulated of exerting a metabolic load on the host cells. 
 ➢  Low level of leaky expression of the protein:  We fmd that the  nmt-185  and  mnt-146  promoters give much lower leaky expression levels as compared to the  nmt 1 promoter but similar to that observed with the  nmt 41, a moderately active derivative of the  nmt 1 promoter. This aspect provides for tighter control of expression. 
 ➢  Ease and reduced cost of manipulation:  Operationally, the temperature shift from 36°C (repressed) to 25°C (expressed) is easy to perform and convenient for bench scale experiments and commercial process, as it significantly reduces the cost and time factor. In contrast, manipulations with the  nmt 1 promoter involve extensive washings to remove the repressor (thiamine) and suspending the cells in thiamin-free medium; these operations add to the cost of expression and production. 
 ➢  Minimum deleterious effect on cell viability  The short time of induction, which is less than one generation time of the growing cells, minimizes the cells' exposure to the toxic effects of the protein. 
 ➢  Reduced level of proteolytic degradation.  The reduced time of exposure of the expressed protein to the cellular environment before being harvested also results in reduced level of degradation by the intracellular proteases.
