 Background technique 
 The present invention relates to the treatment or prevention for cancer, are conjugated in particular for the antibody-drug of cancer immunotherapy
Object and application thereof. 
 Cancer immunotherapy changes the therapeutic modality of cancer patient thoroughly.Interfere immunologic test point (such as CTLA-4
And PD-1) monoclonal antibody have shown that in kinds of tumors type have clinical efficacy (Wolchok et al., 2013；
Callahan and Wolchok, 2013).Other than these antibody, it also developed and adjust a variety of of adaptability and congenital immunity
Other drugs (Khalil et al., 2016；Smyth et al., 2016). 
 In view of the drug resistance generally produced after single therapy, it is assumed that conjoint therapy will improve clinical benefit.In fact,
The joint study of panimmunity treatment has led to improved reactivity and survival rate (Larkin et al., 2015). 
 Other than the therapeutic agent of selectively targeted immune system, also show that have to immune system according to other medicaments are described
There are some effects.It has been shown that some chemotherapy (such as anthracycline and oxaliplatin) inducing immunogenic cell deaths (ICD)
And increase antitumor response (Rios-Doria et al., 2015；Galluzzi et al., 2012；Tesniere et al., 2010；
Obeid et al., 2007), every document, which all passes through to quote, to be incorporated herein.ICD is certain cytotoxic drugs to cause immunogene
Property molecule release mode induce tumour cell apoptosis process. 
 Targeted therapies (such as MEK and BRAF inhibitor) also have shown that with some immunoregulation effects (Liu et al. people,
2015；Hu-Lieskovan et al., 2015；Vanneman and Dranoff, 2012, every document, which all passes through to quote, is incorporated to this
Text), however these therapeutic agents whether cause ICD by other certain mechanism or influence immune system is unclear. 
 Chemotherapy or targeted therapies need systemic administration drug, therefore two kinds of therapies not target tumors itself.?
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) classification, which is developed, by the way that cytotoxicity payload is directly conjugated to antibody overcomes the limit
System, the antibody is close and is specifically bound to the antigen being overexpressed on tumour cell.It is effectively negative that ADC can provide cytotoxicity
It is loaded onto the positioning delivery of tumour, and has shown that the accumulation intracellular for promoting drug in tumour cell.It is this to be located in tumour
Inside provide relatively high drug concentration, and the systemic administration of unconjugated (that is, not targeting) drug to realize it is identical swollen
Tumor concentration then may generate unacceptable toxic level to normal cell. 
 Have studied the immunoregulatory activity of some ADC payloads.M ü ller et al. has shown that, hinders when with checkpoint
When disconnected joint, Ansamitocins P3 and the direct dendritic cell maturation of aplysiatoxin induction and increase antitumor efficacy (Muller et al.,
2014b；Muller et al., 2014a, this two documents are incorporated herein by quoting).From the viewpoint of mechanism, by ADC with exempt from
The method (Gerber et al., 2016) for having been considered as increasing antitumor response is combined in epidemic disease treatment.In fact, a nearest Xiang Yan
Study carefully and show when combining with anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1, T-DM1 (ADC of targeting Her2 receptor) generates antitumor in Mice Body
Synergistic effect, provide ADC and immunization therapy is combined can produce the initial concept verifying of powerful antitumor effect (Muller et al.,
2015)。 
 Most of ADC and following microtubule inhibitors payload are conjugated in clinical development at present: statin class in difficult to understand
(auristatins) or class CHROMATOGRAPHIC FRACTIONATION AND MASS (maytansinoids).(Sievers and Senter, 2013, the document is by quoting
It is incorporated herein).In this report, the immunoregulatory activity of other two kinds of ADC payloads: PBD (pyrrolo- benzo two is had studied
Azepine Class) and tubulysin class (tubulysins) (Hartley, 2011；Li et al. people, 2016).The effect of tubulysin class
Mechanism is that tubulin polymerization object is made to go to stablize, and the G2/M in mitosis is caused to stagnate, so as to cause Apoptosis, and PBD
Interchain linkage is formed in DNA, leads to mitotic arrest and subsequent Apoptosis during the S phase.With PBD payload
ADC be highly effective, external EC50 typically in low picomolar range (Saunders et al., 2015).Although more
Effectively, but the micro-pipe destabilization mechanism of tubulysin is similar to statin class and class CHROMATOGRAPHIC FRACTIONATION AND MASS in Austria.Nevertheless,
But have shown that such compound (micro-pipe goes to stablize) can induce immunogenicity effect, and microtubule stabilization chemical combination object then cannot
(Martin et al., 2014).Although exempting from document evidence suggests certain DNA targets can induce to agent (such as radiation and adriamycin)
Epidemic focus cell death, but there are no the open source literatures that display PBD is capable of inducing immunogenic cell death, and in view of
DNA alkylating agent mitomycin C does not induce ICD, though can induce nor obvious (Kroemer et al., 2013；Obeid
Et al., 2007). 
 Therefore, it is necessary to novel immune modulability fluorescent dye with tumour-specific targeting therapy, these therapies, which have to treat to suffer from, works as front
The potentiality of the patient for the illness that method does not meet sufficiently.

 Example 1.5: internal vaccine inoculation research 
 It is handled CT26 cell 24 hours with 400nM AZD9185 (tubulysin) or 8nM SG3199 (PBD), so that carefully
Born of the same parents be intended to cell death (such as by renewed vaccination test in shortage growth assess) but still have > 95% survival.By this
It is inoculated in the left abdomen of BALB/c mouse through 500,000 in processing cell a bit, to test their vaccine inoculation ability,
To be used for subsequent right abdomen challenge.Control includes with 75Gy radiation treatment or has passed through the thin of 3 Frozen-thawed cycleds (necrosis)
Born of the same parents.3 × 10 are utilized after 7 days 6 A untreated CT26 cell throws down the gauntlet on right abdomen. 
 Example 1.6:ADC preparation 
 The antibody of EphA2 is as previously described (Jackson et al., 2008).By PBD and tubulysin payload site-specific
Property is conjugated to by the cysteine in the engineered domain Fc for antibody.Initially, molten by the way that the antibody of 5-10mg/mL concentration to be added to
In three (2- carboxyethyl) phosphines (TCEP) of the PBS edta buffer liquid adjusted through pH, so that resulting antibody/TCEP solution
TCEP/mAb molar ratio be 40 to carry out partial reduction antibody.By antibody/TCEP solution incubation 2.5-3 hours at 37 DEG C.It uses
NAP column by the antibody after reduction through in buffer-exchanged to conjugation reaction buffer (PBS, 1mM EDTA, pH 7.2), to be used for
Milligram grade conjugation.By add hydroascorbic acid (dHAA) DMSO solution with realize 20 dHAA/mAb molar ratio, and
3-4 hours are incubated at 20 DEG C to cause reoxidizing for antibody interchain disulfide bond. 
 PBD or tubulysin payload are prepared and they being dissolved in DMSO to realize the ultimate density of 10mM.
For conjugation reaction, DMSO is slowly added into the antibody after reduction, reaches the ultimate density of 10%v/v, then will effectively bear
It carries and is added in antibody, to realize 12 payload/mAb molar ratio.It is at 20 DEG C that payload/mAb solution incubation 1 is small
When, and conjugation reaction is quenched by addition N-acetylcystein (NAC) solution, to realize 48 NAC/mAb molar ratio, with
It is incubated 15 minutes at 20 DEG C afterwards.Then by final ADC product buffer-exchanged to PBS or 25mM histidine monohydrochloride, 200mM sugarcane
In sugar and 0.02%w/v PS80 (pH 6).In the following manner come characterize gained ADC biochemical property: arranged using size

(HIC-HPLC) confirm drugloading rate.Carry out reduction glycosylation reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrography (LC-MS)
To measure drug: the specificity of antibody ratio (DAR) and locus specificity conjugation.Typically, these conjugation reactions, which generate, has >
The ADC of 98% monomer, wherein coupling efficiency > 90%, related to DAR > 1.82. 
 
 Example 2: vaccine inoculation/challenge measurement 
 
 Different nti-neoplastic compounds command the ability from the dying cell of targeting release immunogenic molecules at them
Aspect is different.Induction that immunogenicity cell death is related to cell surface calreticulin and ATP and HMGB1 are from dying
The release of cell, they are respectively in connection with CD91, P2RX7 and TLR4 on dendritic cells, so as to cause adaptive immune response
Enhancing. 
 Since tubulysin and PBD inhibit to induce with DNA cross-linking mechanism carefully by fundamentally different micro-pipe respectively
Born of the same parents are dead, it is therefore to be understood that they are in terms of the ability of booster immunization in activation dendritic cells or by other means
Different. 
 The internal vaccine inoculation ability of example 2.1:PBD and tubulysin 
 In order to test this point, tubulysin and PBD are used for vaccine inoculation/challenge mouse model.With tubulysin (1 μ
M) or PBD (10nM) handles the period (Figure 1A) that CT26 mouse colonic cell continues 24 hours.At this point, cell is still deposited
It is living, but consequently tend to cell death. 
 By these dying but not dead cell subcutaneous transplantations into the left abdomen of BALB/c mouse, to test their energy
It is no carry out vaccine inoculation with resist after 1 week in opposite side abdomen with tumour formed the untreated CT26 cell of dosage into
Capable subsequent challenge.Cell via radiation is included as positive control, have passed through the non-viable non-apoptotic cell of Frozen-thawed cycled as yin
Property control be included. 
 Vaccine inoculation is not implemented in provided non-viable non-apoptotic cell, because there is no tumor free the 32nd day after CT26 challenge
Mouse (Figure 1B and Fig. 1 C).As was expected, and CT26 cell via radiation has high degree of immunogenicity, and prevents all small
There is tumour in mouse.In assessment in the 65th day, the cell of tubulysin and PBD processing prevented 40% and 70% mouse from being formed respectively
Tumour.These are the results show that the cell of tubulysin processing and the cell of PBD processing provide significant vaccine inoculation. 
 Example 2.2: the internal vaccine inoculation ability of the ADC comprising PBD or tubulysin 
 According in example 2.1 as a result, having studied has with the ADC processing with tubulysin or PBD payload conjugation
Whether the mouse of tumour may also lead to the vaccine inoculation of mouse. 
 For these researchs, using the antibody of targeting EphA2, and the antibody and tubulysin (AZ1508) or PBD
(SG3315) payload is conjugated.It is molten with EphA2- micro-pipe with the expected dosage level and frequency that will generate high proportion complete response
Element or EphA2-PBD processing have the BALB/c mouse of CT26 tumour.When gross tumor volume is 75mm 3 Or 150mm 3 When, to having
The processing of the mouse of CT26 tumour produces a high proportion of complete response (Fig. 2A).After treating and observing for 90 days, about 57%
The mouse for receiving 5mg/kg EphA2- tubulysin has complete response.In contrast, largely receive 1mg/kg EphA2-
The mouse (82%) of PBD all has complete response. 
 Then, these subgroups without mice with tumor are challenged again with CT26 cell, treated with EphA2- tubulysin small
Mouse has 86% to repel tumour cell challenge, and has 76% to repel tumour cell challenge (figure with the mouse that EphA2-PBD is treated
2B).CT26 cell is easily grown in the initial BALB/c mouse that same time is inoculated with.These are the results show that these ADC are lured
The cell killing led produces tumor-specific immunity memory.Then ADC is assessed in another syngeneic tumor model MCA205
The ability of inducing memory.In the model, when with the EphA2-PBD of 1mg/kg application single dose, 10/10 animal has been realized
Full response.After being rechallenged at the 43rd day with MCA205 cell (Fig. 2 C), all mouse are still without tumour, and in initial cell
Tumour growth was not observed up to 160 days after transplanting.In contrast, MCA205 tumour when rechallenging while being transplanted initial
It is easily grown in C57Bl/6 animal.These data show that EphA-Tub and EphA2-PBD are to rechallenge to provide in vivo
Significant vaccine inoculation. 
 The ability of example 2.3:ADC inducing tumor specific immune memory 
 In order to measure the T cell from the mouse for realizing complete response after being treated with ADC with the presence or absence of any function
Variation determines after with AH1 peptide (it is the immunodominant antigen of CT26 cell) in vitro stimulation, from EphA2- tubulysin or
EphA2-PBD obtains the IFN-γ and TNF α production of the spleen t-cell of five mouse of complete response. 
 In the measurement, the CD4 of the mouse of Lai Ziyong EphA2- tubulysin processing + T cell is produced when being stimulated with AH1 peptide
It has given birth to TNF α (Fig. 3 A), and has been generated come the CD4+T cell of the animal for both EphA2- tubulysin and EphA2-PBD processing of using by oneself
IFN-γ (Fig. 3 B).Similar expression pattern is found in CD8 + T cell (Fig. 3 C-D). 
 In short, these data are shown, these ADC remember induction of tumor-specific immunity, and these cells with come from
The T cell of initial mouse is functionally different.In addition, due to only having EphA2- tubulysin thin induction of TNF-α secretion T
Born of the same parents, therefore seem that there are payload specificity responses. 
 
 Example 3: effect of the immune system in the anti-tumor activity that ADC is induced 
 
 The antitumor research of most of assessment ADC has been carried out in immunodeficient mouse.Because of the tables of data in example 2
Bright T cell may play a role in anti-tumor activity, so having evaluated these EphA2ADC compared with immune competent mice and existing
Anti-tumor activity in T cell defect (naked) mouse. 
 Example 3.1: the immune sound anti-tumor activity with immunodeficient mouse 
 ADC is had evaluated to three kinds of syngeneic tumor models (CT26, the 4T1 grown in immune sound or immunodeficient mouse
And MCA205) anti-tumor activity (Fig. 4).In each tumor model, compared with immunodeficient mouse (left figure), EphA2- is micro-
Both pipe lysin (above) and EphA2-PBD (following figure) all have bigger antitumor work in immune competent mice (right figure)
Property. 
 These are the results show that function immune system is important the fully active of these ADC, and shows T cell pair
ADC is important in immune effect perfected in model. 
 Example 3.2:T cell the ADC the effect of in effect 
 Whether it is important to test T cell to ADC in immune effect perfected in model, with EphA2- tubulysin
Or EphA2-PBD ADC and CD8 exhaust mouse of the Antybody therapy with CT26 tumour. 
 Strikingly, CD8 + The exhaustion of T cell keeps individual ADC invalid (Fig. 5).When progress Isotype control antibodies
When administration, on ADC activity without influence.These are the results show that T cell is important ADC in immune effect perfected in model. 
 The above results show that the anti-tumor activity that immune response may be responsible for ADC induction increases. 
 The synergistic effect of example 4:ADC and cancer immunotherapy 
 The cell that tubulysin or PBD are killed can be with vaccinated mice to resist the fact that CT26 tumour rechallenges table
Bright, these bullets can be with inducing immunogenic cell death.Combine if had studied with cancer immunotherapy, carries these bullets
ADC whether can generate summation action or potential synergistic effect. 
 It is individually or antibody combined to the BALB/c mouse progress EphA2-ADC administration (figure with CT26 tumour with anti-PD-L1
6)。 
 Modest antitumor activity is produced with the anti-PD-L1 treatment of 0.1mg/kg EphA2-PBD or 30mg/kg, wherein every
In ten mouse of group, there are two complete responses (CR), i.e., subside (Fig. 6 B and Fig. 6 C) completely.However anti-PD-L1 and EphA2-PBD
Combine the collaboration response (Fig. 6 D) produced with 7/10CR.It should be noted that the EphA2-PBD of 0.1mg/kg is that ADC exists
Suboptimum dosage (Fig. 4 A) in CT26 model. 
 Tumor growth delay is resulted in EphA2- tubulysin ADC processing mouse, but without CR (Fig. 6 E).With mouse GITR
Ligand fusion protein processing mouse has caused effective antitumour activity, wherein 8/12 animal realizes CR (Fig. 6 F).However,
The combining to produce of EphA2- tubulysin ADC and GITRL FP response is cooperateed with, wherein observing in all (12/12) mouse
To CR (Fig. 6 G). 
 The studies above has been carried out by being administered while ADC and immunization therapy.When postponing the administration of immunization therapy, observation
To the result to differ widely.It carried out not observing joint when anti-PD-L1 administration (Fig. 6 H) at 15 days after EphA2-PBD ADC
Effect.The progress GITRL FP administration in 15 days after EphA2- tubulysin ADC observes that joint effect substantially reduces (figure
6I).These data show that the dosage regimen of ADC and IMT are important activity. 
 These ADC and anti-PD-1 antibody or the united joint study of OX40 ligand fusion protein are also carried out.From these connection
It is as shown in Figure 6 to close the result obtained in research.These are the results show that compared with single agent activity, these ADC and these cancers
Combining for immunization therapy produces synergistic antitumor response. 
 These are the results show that ADC is combined with the agonist of checkpoint inhibitor or TNFR superfamily to be had in vivo
Effect, the antitumor action enhanced. 
 CD8 exhaustion also eliminates the united activity of ADC and anti-PD-L1 (Fig. 7 and referring to example 3.2).These data show,
CD8 + T cell plays a role in ADC in immune perfect in the activity in animal. 
 The pharmacodynamic studies of example 5:ADC 
 In order to measure these ADC in vivo to the effect of immunocyte, pharmacodynamics has been carried out in CT26 model and has been ground
Study carefully. 
 By EphA2-PBD or EphA2- tubulysin individually or with PD-L1 or OX40 are antibody combined is applied to CT26
The mouse of tumour.5 days or 12 days harvest spleens and tumour after medicament administration, and study the variation of immunocyte group. 
 EphA2- tubulysin is induction of CD45 + Lymphocyte and CD45 + CD8 + Both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)
Tumor-infiltrated (Fig. 9, A-B).Although EphA2-PBD does not induce the tumor-infiltrated of these cell types, it really with
EphA2- tubulysin is together induction of CD8 pre-existing in tumour + The activation of cell, such as passes through CD8 + CD69 + Group is reflected
Fixed (Fig. 9 C).Both anti-OX40 treatment and EphA2-PBD and EphA2- tubulysin is also observed to combine with anti-PD-L1 pair
The activation of CD8+ cell.EphA2- tubulysin, OX40 antibody combine individually and with two kinds of ADC and reduce total CD4 in tumour + 
The quantity (Fig. 9 D) of T cell.In the subgroup, after EphA2- tubulysin is individually or with anti-PD-L1 combination therapy, tumour
Middle FOXP3 + Cell (regulatory T cells (T reg ) marker) quantity slightly increase (Fig. 9 E).In contrast, with OX40
Antibody individually or with after ADC combination therapy, T in tumour reg Quantity substantially reduce (Fig. 9 E).However, although EphA2- micro-pipe
Lysin makes T reg Slightly increase, but the CD8:T in the group reg Ratio and untreated tumour and with individually and with two kinds of ADC join
The OX40 antibody of conjunction is compared and generally increases (Fig. 9 F).Two kinds of ADC induction of PD-1 expression and greater percentage be in Ki67
Positive CD8 + Cell shows CD8 + T cell proliferation increases (Fig. 9, G-H).EphA- tubulysin with OX40 is antibody combined controls
After treatment, CD8 + PD-1 and Ki67 expression on cell also increase.Two kinds of ADC can also induce CD4 in spleen + The proliferation of cell,
Such as CD45 + CD4 + Ki67 + (Fig. 9 I) shown in the quantity increase of cell.However, observing compared with individual medicament, EphA2-PBD
Combine with anti-PD-L1 and OX40 and EphA2- tubulysin combines with anti-PD-L1 and causes spleen CD4 + T cell proliferation is shown
Write bigger increase (Fig. 9 I).The discovery highlights compared with single agent treatment, and ADC+IMT conjoint therapy causes significant bigger
Antitumor action a kind of potential mechanism. 
 When checking the variation of myeloid cell, discovery ADC increases the level of CD86 in multiple cell masses.These results
It is illustrated in fig. 10 shown below.EphA2- tubulysin individually and with anti-PD-L1 or OX40 combined induction CD45 + CD86 + The tumour of cell
Infiltration.These identical group also increases F480 + The expression of CD86 on macrophage.Since CD86 is the increased mark of antigen presentation
Will object, therefore these be the results show that EphA2- tubulysin can directly induce the cell that may have this enhancing ability
It is tumor-infiltrated.Although EphA2-PBD does not induce CD45 + CD86 + Cell it is tumor-infiltrated, but EphA2-PBD individually or with it is anti-
PD-L1 and OX40 joint is really induction of CD45 + CD11c + MHCII hi CD86 expression on mature dendritic cell.In fact, removing
Except individual anti-PD-L1, all processing groups increase the expression of the CD86 on mature dendritic cell.It is interesting that EphA2-
Tubulysin is combined individually and with anti-PD-L1 and EphA2-PBD combines with anti-OX40 and increases CD86 in tumour + Graininess
The percentage of MDSC shows that the antigen presentation phenotype on these cells increases. 
 The master between joint and single medication is observed on the myeloid cell in the spleen of the animal with CT26 tumour
Want phenotypic difference.Compared with individual anti-PD-L1, EphA2- tubulysin or EphA2-PBD combine with anti-PD-L1 increases spleen
Dirty middle CD45 + CD11c + MHCII hi The percentage of mature dendritic cell.EphA2- tubulysin is combined with anti-OX40 with class
As effect, but EphA2-PBD combine with OX40 then do not have the effect.Compared with individual anti-PD-L1, EphA2-PBD and
EphA2- tubulysin is combined with anti-PD-L1 increases CD45 + CD86 expression on lymphocyte.It is interesting that EphA2-
Tubulysin combines the CD86 expression also increased on these cells with anti-OX40, but EphA2-PBD combines then with anti-OX40
Do not increase.The phenotype represents the differentiation effect when OX40 antibody is with tubulysin joint compared with the ADC based on PBD.It is right
Other inspections of spleen Zhong Sui sample group disclose the adjusting expressed CD86 on MDSC.Compared with single medication, EphA2-PBD
Combine with EphA2- tubulysin with anti-PD-L1 and increases CD86 + The percentage of monokaryon MDSC.EphA2- tubulysin and anti-
OX40, which combines, also increases CD86 + Monokaryon MDSC, but EphA2-PBD combines with anti-OX40, does not increase.With individual anti-PD-
L1 is compared, EphA2-PBD and EphA2- tubulysin also increases the percentage that CD86 is expressed on graininess MDSC.EphA2- micro-pipe
Lysin and anti-OX40 combine the percentage for increasing CD86+ graininess MDSC in spleen, but EphA2-PBD and anti-OX40 joint is then
Do not increase.Strikingly, compared with EphA2-PBD combines, EphA2- tubulysin is combined with anti-PD-L1 and anti-OX40 to be lured
The significant higher infiltration of these cells is led.These are the results show that the ADC induction with PBD or tubulysin payload
Immunophenotype variation in tumour and spleen. 
 The results show that two different ADC payloads, induction of immunoregulation effect, this effect does not have report previously
Road.Although PBD and tubulysin have different cytotoxic effect mechanism, perfect in background immune, two kinds effectively
Load can induce the immunogenicity cell shown when being administered in combination with the ADC of these payloads conjugation and immunization therapy
It is dead.This point is also supported in the discovery that two kinds of payloads are capable of inducing antigen-specific immunological memory.In particular, result
It has been shown that, these ADC payloads disclose effect of these payloads in dendritic cells activation to the effect of immunocyte,
Combine to generate with the potent of immunization therapy, which depends on CD8 + T cell. 
 In short, these statistics indicate that, the combination therapy of the ADC and immunization therapy that are discussed herein can provide increased clinical anti-
It answers. 
 All data provided so far are using always the CT26 model sensitive to many immunization therapies, and use targeting
The ADC of single tumor associated antigen EphA2.In order to confirm with the effect of the ADC of the targeting EphA2 ADC payload observed
Independent of model, and it can be applied to the ADC for other targets, we start to measure in different syngeneic tumor models
Whether ADC can combine with immunization therapy, and using whether targeting the ADC of different tumor associated antigens to observe that collaboration is made
With.CT26 cell is overexpressed IGF1R receptor, therefore makes to identify that mouse IGF1R antibody and PBD payload are conjugated.It is having been established
CT26 tumour in give IGF1R-PBD with the single administration of 1mg/kg and obtain an example CR (Figure 11 A, upper right).Anti- PD-L1 treatment
Generate 4 CR (Figure 11 A, lower-left).However, the joint generates synergistic effect, wherein observed CR in 11/12 mouse.
These are the results show that ADC and the synergistic effect of immunization therapy can be observed with different ADC. 
 Then EphA2ADC is had evaluated in MCA205 tumor model, because the model is also overexpressed EphA2 receptor.To tool
There is the mouse of MCA205 tumour to carry out EphA2- tubulysin (Figure 11 B, upper right), OX40 ligand fusion protein (Fig. 9 B, lower-left)
With the administration of joint (Fig. 9 B, bottom right).The treatment of EphA2- tubulysin causes 2 CR, OX40FP to lead to 0 CR, but combines
Treatment leads to 6/12 CR.These the results show that ADC and immunization therapy combine caused by synergistic antitumor effect can also be
It represents and is observed in the different tumor models of different patient tumors phenotypes. 
 Then EphA2-PBD is had evaluated in Renca tumor model.Since the agonist antibody of GITR has shown that exhaustion
T in mouse model reg , and Renca model shows that growth will depend on T before this reg (25), therefore we have checked T reg 
Depletion mouse GITR ligand fusion protein (mGITRL FP) acts in combination with EphA2-PBD ADC.With EphA2-PBD (figure
11C, upper right), mGITRL FP (Figure 12 C, lower-left) or joint (Figure 12 C, bottom right) treatment have Renca tumour mouse.With
EphA2-PBD treatment mouse does not result in CR, and mGITRL FP is induction of 3 CR.Strikingly, EphA2-PBD and
Combining for mGITRL FP produces CR in 8/10 mouse.ADC of these data confirm thats with PBD payload is shown
Out with the third tumor model of the synergistic effect of immunization therapy. 
 Difference between example 6:ADC payload 
 Although the ADC with tubulysin or PBD payload can act synergistically with immunization therapy, ought with this
When checking immune microenvironment after a little ADC treatment mouse, most of difference between these payloads is observed. 
 (it is included in dendritic cells, macrophage in many marrow sample compartments with the EphA2 ADC of tubulysin payload conjugation
On cell and MDSC) successive induction CD86 expression.EphA2-PBD only observes identical effect in some cases. 
 In short, following viewpoint: these payload inducing immunogenic cell deaths is supported in these discoveries, and at least right
For dendritic cells, CD86 up-regulation can indicate the increase of the antigen presentation of these cells.
