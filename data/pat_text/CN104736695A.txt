 Embodiment 
 Usually, pig STEC and many pig ETEC bacterial strains express F18 determinant.F18 determinant promotes that bacterial colonization is in the mattress hair (.2006 such as Fairbrother on intestinal mucosa surface, PostweaningEscherichiacoli diarrhea and edema disease.In:Diseases 0f swine, ed.Straw B, Zimmermann JJ, D ' Allaire S, Taylor DJ, 9th edition, 649-662 page .Blackwell Publishing, Ames, IA).Think that bacterial cell sticking on intestinal receptor ECF18R acceptor of F18 is expressed in the mediation of F18 pili, this receptor by the intestinal cells of small intestine to be exposed on its apical cell plasma membrane (
         deng .1996, Anim Genet 27:321-328; The .1996 such as Waddell, Infect Immun 64:1714-1719).
       
 Some pig STEC and STEC/ETEC bacterial strain can express other cell adhesions (cytoadhesive) mattress hair or non-mattress hair adhesin except F18 pili, particularly F4 or F5 mattress hair or " participating in the adhesin that diffusivity is sticked " (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence, AIDA) (Barth etc., 2007, Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr 120:307-316; The .2009 such as DebRoy, J Vet Diagn Invest 21:359-364; Fairbrother etc., see above; Niewerth etc.: 2001, Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 8:143-149).Although AIDA adhesin usually occurs in these two kinds of pathogenic agent, F4 or F5 mattress hair is comparatively rare in these bacterial strains. 
 In farm, Post Weaning Diarrhea (the post-weaning diarrhea of pig, and edema disease (edema disease PWD), ED) usually occur in wean rear first 2 weeks, PwD is relevant to pathogenic F4 or F18 enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (ETEC) strain infection, and ED is relevant to intestinal bacteria (STEC) strain infection of generation pathogenic F18 shiga toxin.For these two kinds of bacterial strains, mattress hair (i.e. F4 or F18) makes bacterium can be adhered to it to be positioned at special receptor on intestinal villi, surely grows in intestines succeeded by bacterium division. 
 In PWD, the pig of about 30% to 40% is expressed F4 acceptor and F18 acceptor detected in the pig of about 70% to 80%.Pathogenic bacterial strains produces the combination of multiple toxin (such as LT, STa and STb).The pig infected by ETEC-F4 is led to and shows very high sickness rate, delayed growth, usually causes water sample and ejection (projectile) diarrhoea of infected animal dead. 
 For ED, in the pig of about 70% to 80%, detect F18 acceptor.The toxin relevant to STEC is Stx2e, this is a kind of blood vessel toxin of vasoactive endotheliocyte, and it causes oedema and neurological signs subsequently, comprises ataxia, accumbency (decumbency), for PWD, finally usually cause the death of infected animal.

 As shown in Table 5, compared with the pig accepting placebo, lower attack bacterial strain let out by the pork chop using the composition of combination.The placebo animals (56%) exceeding half attack the last time after the 5th day (research terminates) still can drain attack bacterial strain, but after early attacking the last time the 4th day does not just detect attack bacterial strain in the animal of the compositions-treated with combination. 
 Fig. 2 illustrates live bacteria count (the CFU)/g of the attack bacterial strain of the excretion from treated animal and control animal ight soil.From treated animal and control animal, the concentration peak of the attack bacterial strain of excretion is all found out in latter 14 days of wean (attacking latter 0 day).In treated animal, the concentration of attacking bacterial strain in ight soil the 2nd day (after wean the 16th day) after attack starts to reduce, and observe attack the last time after the 4th day and the 5th day its reduce further compared to placebo.These results are consistent with PCR result.Or rather, after attacking the last time the 5th day (research terminates), the composition using combination makes the low about 2log of the drain water pancake of attack bacterial strain. 
 B) attack bacterial strain and surely grow ileum and caecum 
 For both intestinal tissue sections (ileum and caecum), observe the difference that between treated animal and placebo animals, enteron aisle is grown surely.The composition that Fig. 3 shows to use combination significantly reduces attack bacterial strain intestinal canal colonization.Or rather, after attacking the last time the 5th day (research terminate), the composition using combination makes attack bacterial strain determining to grow and reduce about 2log ileum and caecum. 
 C) immunne response evaluation 
 Use the existence for the whole body lgM of F18 pili in specific ELISA evaluation serum sample.Use latter 7 days, the animal through the compositions-treated of combination just shows specific immune response (Fig. 4). 
 Based on the reduction that the attack bacterial strain caused is grown surely, the stimulation of excretion and the anti-F18 antibody of specificity reduces, and this research shows can prevent F18 intestinal bacteria enterobacterial infection through sending the composition comprising described non-virulent F18 bacterial strain herein through intestines. 
 
 
 Embodiment 4 
 One widely in, the object of this research evaluates the effect of described non-virulent F18 coli strain herein. 
 I-research and design 
 A) animal 
 Before animal enters facility, at product farrowing unit to 10 nest sucking pigletss, 10, every nest, 100 piglets carry out sampling for DNA isolation and screen F18 acceptor (RF18+) state by RFLP-PCR method altogether.By in nest dividing regions group by 30 (30) RF18+ piglet random assignments (1: 1 ratio) among each group, the dividing regions group size n=6 of generation.Piglet is dispensed to one of following group: the T1 (n=15) using non-virulent F18 test strain; And use the T2 (n=15) of placebo. 
 The animal of treated group (T1) to be blended in the pen of experimental room and the animal of placebo (T2) is blended in the pen of another experimental room until phase of the attack.In day of attack (after namely using non-virulent F18 bacterial strain or placebo 11 days), the animal of T1 group (n=15) and T2 group (n=15) is transferred to 2 the independent pens being arranged in and attacking room before attack.All 15 pigs of special processing group are blended in corresponding pen.Except not giving except animal water before vaccine inoculation, running through animal in whole research and arbitrarily obtaining water.Use the high soyflour nutrition purposes, especially for feeding animals twice (U.S.6,355,859) of non-dosing every day. 
 After wean the 1st day, gather the existence that fecal sample is grown surely to use pcr analysis to determine the pathogenic F4-ETEC positive strain that derives from farm and F18-ETEC/STEC positive strain.The gene of target is STa, STb, LT, F4, Stx2 and F18.Do not find the animal that the 1st day is positive to F4-ETEC or F18-ETEC/STEC bacterium after wean.For the reason of animal welfare, from research, withdraw from three (3) animals of T1 group.And think that using of these adverse events and non-virulent F18 bacterial strain is uncorrelated.

 II-program and evaluation 
 Can not mix T1 group and T2 treated animal, reason is that the treated animal of Property requirements of tested products (i.e. living vaccine) separates stable breeding with placebo.Non-virulent F18 bacterial strain and placebo solution is prepared by the personnel not participating in the animal stage.Code " A " and " B " are randomly assigned to non-virulent F18 bacterial strain and placebo solution.Room is randomly assigned to treatment group and is labeled as room 1 and room 2.Each room has and is blended in all T1 groups in single pen or all T2 treated animals.Participate in the animal stage and the personnel carrying out lab analysis do not know process and room distribution.For the postmortem stage, make the order random assignment of the animal for the treatment of postmortem and animal is labeled as A to AD again.The personnel performed an autopsy on sb. do not know pig mark and process.Hatted code leaves in the envelope of sealing by the biometrics personnel be responsible for. 
 A) non-virulent F18 bacterial strain preparation and use 
 By non-virulent F18 strain culturing in fermentor tank, then that bacterium is freezing and be stored at-78 DEG C and comprise in the 10mL vial of 200 nominal standard doses.The freezing bacterium of dilute with water under room temperature before use. 
 In latter 1 day of wean (the 0th day) with about 3 × 10
         8 the dosage of CFU/2mL agent is used once.Use the syringe oral administration dosage being provided with rubber tubing.Control animal accepts the placebo solution (water) of identical amount.
       
 B) bacterial strain (F18-STEC bacterial strain EcL 14724) is attacked 
 The attack bacterial strain being used for this mensuration is separated from the piglet (#381) previously attacked with EcL 14724 bacterial strain (being positive with Paa to Stx2, F18ab, AIDA) again.(11,12 and 13 days of research) will attack bacterial strain with 1 × 10 for three days on end
         10 cFU/ pig oral administration once.The gelatine capsule of oesophagus intubate surrogate is used as to use each challenge dose.Attack after bacterial strain using, immediately with gelatine capsule oral administration Carbadox (stimulating the microbiotic of shiga toxin release) to cause the release of shiga toxin.
       
 C) general health evaluation 
 The general health of a pig is observed every day before attacking the period.After first time attacks, monitor the general health (comprising depression, dehydration, appetite) of animal and any clinical symptom relevant to edema disease twice daily: ataxia, face or edema of the limbs, sudden death. 
 D) evaluation of bacterial strain is attacked in discharge 
 Maximum likelihood number PCR (Most-Probable-Number PCR, the MPN-PCR) method of the gene of the FedA major protein of target coding F18 pili is used to carry out quantitatively the ight soil discharge of attacking bacterial strain. 
 E) postmortem 
 Attack in first time and perform an autopsy on sb. for latter 7 days.Use about 2cm
         2 the tissue of part utilize target encode maximum likelihood number PCR (MPN-PCR) method of gene of FedA major protein of F18 pili quantitatively attack bacterial strain to caecum determine grow.
