 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 This invention relates to a novel polypeptide, a novel DNA fragment encoding the novel polypeptide, a vector containing the novel DNA fragment, a transformant capable of producing the novel polypeptide, a process for producing the novel polypeptide, a drug composition containing the novel polypeptide as an effective ingredient and a protease inhibition process in which the novel polypeptide is used. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 As it is universally known, various proteases including trypsin and chymotrypsin exist in the body. While these proteases take important roles in the body such as digestion, defense mechanism, blood coagulation and fibrinolysis and the like, it has been revealed by previous studies that they also cause diseases and troubles directly or indirectly. Shock, pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC) and the like are known as typical diseases which are caused by abnormal activation of proteases. 
 various types of protease inhibitors have been used with the aim of treating such protease-related diseases. The protease inhibitors so far used as pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of these diseases are divided into two groups, namely chemically synthesized compounds and natural substances in most cases, chemically synthesized compounds are applicable to oral administration and have a broad enzyme inhibition spectrum, while each of the natural substances inhibits each own specific protease and is possessed of other functions than its enzyme inhibition function, such as a cell growth enhancing activity and the like. 
 Inhibition spectrum of each natural protease inhibitor is greatly related to the kinds and sequence of amino acids on its active center. For example, trypsin type enzymes are inhibited by a protease inhibitor when an amino acid of a principal position P 1  on the active center of the protease inhibitor is Lys or Arg, chymotrypsin type enzymes are inhibited when the P 1  amino acid is Phe or Tyr and elastase type enzymes are inhibited when the P 1  amino acid is Ala, Ser or Val (Laskowski M., Jr., Biochem. Pharmacol., vol. 29, pp. 2089-2094, 1980). In consequence, it is assumed that inhibition spectrum of a natural protease inhibitor can be changed by substituting an amino acid which is a composing element of the active center of the inhibitor. Such an approach has already been applied to several natural protease inhibitors. For example, Brinkmann et al. have reported that chymotrypsin inhibition activity of aprotinin was improved when positions P 1  and P' 2  on the active center of aprotinin were substituted by a hydrophobic amino acid such as Phe, Tyr, Leu or the like (Thomas Brinkmann et al., Eur. J. Biochem., vol. 202, pp. 95-99, 1991). In addition, Fritz et al. have prepared a substance by substituting an amino acid on the active center of Bikunins (HI-30) by other amino acid, and have measured its elastase- and trypsin-inhibiting activities (Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 3-255099, 1991; European Patent EP401508, 1990). 
 Since changes in the properties of a protease inhibitor caused by such an amino acid substitution exert influence not only upon its enzyme inhibition spectrum but also upon its route of administration, pharmacological function and the like, it is important to develop various types of protease inhibitors having such new characteristics for use in the treatment of diseases and to use the new inhibitors according to the conditions of each disease to be treated. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 In view of the above, it therefore becomes an object of the present invention to provide a novel polypeptide as a protease inhibitor having new characteristics as described above, especially having high FXa inhibition activity, which comprises, at least as a pare of the polypeptide, an amino acid sequence resulting from substitution of an amino acid for at least one amino acid in the following amino acid sequence (1), wherein the amino acid substitution is at least one substitution selected from the following substitution means (i) to (iii).

______________________________________                                    
 
 The polypeptide represented by the above amino acid sequence of  formula  1 has been found for the first time by the present inventors as a polypeptide having an activity to inhibit activated blood coagulation factor X (to be referred to as "FXa" hereinafter) (Japanese Patent Application No. 03-325220). The amino acid sequence of this polypeptide coincides with a part of the amino acid sequence of urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) or Bikunins (HI-30). However, the polypeptide represented by the above amino acid sequence of  formula  1 is clearly different from UTI or HI-30, because the polypeptide of  formula  1 has a high FXa-inhibiting activity while the latter two peptides hardly show such an activity. The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies with the aim of improving the value of the polypeptide of  formula  1. As the results, the present inventors have succeeded in obtaining a novel polypeptide having new characteristics by substituting an amino acid at a specific position in the above amino acid sequence with another amino acid, a position which could not be predicted from the information so far available. In other words, the inventors of the present invention have succeeded in developing a novel polypeptide having new characteristics unknown in the prior art by substituting an amino acid at a specific position with another amino acid, at a position which is different from the active center reported by Wachter et al. and by Sailer (Wachter et al , Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol Chem vol. 360, pp. 1297-1303, 1979; and Jean-Philippe Sailer, TIBS, vol. 15, pp. 435-439, 1990).

 (b) preparing a vector which contains the DNA fragment obtained in the above step (a), 
 (c) isolating a transformant by transforming a host cell with the vector obtained in the above step b), and 
 (d) culturing the transformant obtained in the above step c) thereby allowing it to produce a polypeptide described in the first aspect of the present invention and subsequently recovering said polypeptide from cultured medium. 
 According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a drug composition which contains the polypeptide described in the first aspect of the present invention as an active ingredient. 
 According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a protease inhibition process which comprises using the polypeptide described in the first aspect of the present invention. 
 The following describes the present invention in detail 
 The novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention is characterized in that it contains, at least as a part thereof, an amino acid sequence resulting from substitution of at least one amino acid in the aforementioned amino acid sequence represented by  formula  1 with a different amino acid. 
 The term "a polypeptide containing an amino acid sequence as a part thereof" as used herein means that, when a polypeptide is defined by its primary structure, the polypeptide may be defined either by the amino acid sequence itself or by an amino acid sequence in which the N-terminus, the C-terminus or both termini of the former amino acid sequence is or are supplemented with one or more optional amino acids. Polypeptide-defining elements other than the primary structure, such as the presence of a sugar chain and the like, are not particularly limited. 
 Preferably, substitution of an amino acid may be effected at least at the 7 position, the 15 position or 42 position of the amino acid sequence of the  aforementioned formula  1, counting from its N-terminus. In other words, an amino acid sequence to be used at least as a part of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention may be derived from the amino acid sequence of  formula  1 by substituting only Arg at the 7 position of the sequence with another amino acid, only Gln at the 15 position with another amino acid or only Tyr at the 42 position with another amino acid, counting from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence. Also, at least two of the 7 position Arg, 15 position Gln and 42 position Tyr may be substituted simultaneously with other amino acids. In addition to these substitutions, one or more other amino acids at different positions may be substituted by optional amino acids. 
 Preferably, the substitution of the amino acids may at least increase the protease inhibiting activity of the polypeptide or improve the secretion of the polypeptide from host cells when the polypeptide is produced by recombinant DNA techniques in comparison with the original polypeptide prior to the amino acid substitution. 
 More preferably, the substitution of the amino acids may be effective for improving at least one property of the polypeptide selected from the group consisting of; 
 (i) increasing the activities of the polypeptide to inhibit FXa, 
 (ii) having an improved secretion from a transformant when the polypeptide is produced by recombinant DNA techniques, and 
 (iii) increasing the activities of the polypeptide to inhibit elastase. 
 Substitution of the 15 position Gln or 42 position Tyr by other amino acids is effective for changing protease inhibiting activity of a polypeptide which contains the amino acid sequence of  formula  1, especially for altering its activity to inhibit at least FXa. In addition, substitution of the 7 position Arg with another amino acid is effective for changing its protease inhibiting activity, especially at least elastase. 
 Substitution of the 7 position Arg with another amino acid is effective for easy secretion of the resulting polypeptide from host cells when the polypeptide is produced by recombinant DNA techniques. When an least two of the 7 position, 15 position and 42 position amino acids are substituted simultaneously by other amino acids, it is possible no obtain additive effects of the employed substitutions. 
 The polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention may preferably contain, at least as a part thereof, an amino acid sequence resulting from at least one substitution in the amino acid sequence of  formula  1, which is selected from the following substitutions (1) to (11); 
 (1) substitution of Lys for the 15 position Gln counting from the N-terminus, 
 (2) substitution of Arg for the 15 position Gln counting from the N-terminus, 
 (3) substitution of Glu for the 42 position Tyr counting from the N-terminus, 
 (4) substitution of Asp for the 42 position Tyr counting from the N-terminus, 
 (5) substitution of Glu for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus, 
 (6) substitution of Gln for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus, 
 (7) substitution of Asp for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus, 
 (8) substitution of Leu for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus, 
 (9) substitution of Asn for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus, 
 (10) substitution of Ser for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus, and 
 (11) substitution of Ala for the 7 position Arg counting from the N-terminus. 
 Aforementioned effects of the substitution of at least one amino acid in the amino acid sequence of  formula  1 on the properties of the resulting polypeptide can also be found when the N-terminus, the C-terminus or both termini of the  formula  1 sequence is or are supplemented with one or more optional amino acids. In consequence, the novel polypeptide of the present invention may contain, at lease as a part thereof, an amino acid sequence in which the N-terminus, the C-terminus or both termini of the amino acid sequence resulting from substitution of at least one amino acid in the amino acid sequence of  formula  1 by other amino acid is or are further added with one or more optional amino acids. The kinds and numbers of amino acids to be added are not particularly limited, provided that the characteristic nature of the novel polypeptide of the present invention is not spoiled completely by the amino acid addition. 
 A preferred amino acid sequence to be added to the N-terminus may be selected from the following sequences (1) to (5); 
 (1) Asp Asp Ala Ala (SEQ. I.D. NO.:69), 
 (2) Thr Val Ala ala (SEQ. I.D. NO.:71) 
 (3) Val Ala Ala, 
 (4) Ala Ala, and 
 (5) Ala. 
 A derivative of each of the above amino acid sequences (1) to (5) may also be used as an amino acid sequence to be added to the N-terminus, such as a derivative in which at least one amino acid in any of the amino acid sequences (1) to (5) is substituted with another optional amino acid, a derivative in which at least one optional amino acid is added to or deleted from any of the amino acid sequences (1) to (5) or a derivative in which such substitution, addition and deletion are effected simultaneously in any of the amino acid sequences (1) to (5). These added sequences are useful when the novel polypeptide is produced using an Escherichia coli cell culture. 
 A preferred amino acid sequence to be added to the C-terminus may be selected be from the following sequences (1) to (15); 
 (1) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu Leu Leu Arg Phe Ser Asn SEQ. I.D. NO.: 73), 
 (2) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu Leu Leu Arg Phe Ser, 
 (3) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu Leu Leu Arg Phe, 
 (4) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu Leu Leu Arg, 
 (5) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu Leu Leu, 
 (6) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu Leu, 
 (7) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp Glu Glu, 
 (8) Gly Val Pro Gly ASp Gly Asp Glu, 
 (9) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp Gly Asp, 
 (10) Gly Val Pro Gly ASp Gly, 
 (11) Gly Val Pro Gly Asp, 
 (12) Gly Val Pro Gly, 
 (13) Gly Val Pro, 
 (14) Gly Val, and 
 (15) Gly. 
 A derivative of each of the above amino acid sequences (1) to (15) may also be used as an amino acid sequence to be added to the C-terminus side, such as a derivative in which at least one amino acid in any of the amino acid sequences (1) to (15) is substituted by other optional amino acid, a derivative in which at least one optional amino acid is added to or deleted from any of the amino acid sequences (1) to (15) or a derivative in which such substitution, addition and deletion are effected simultaneously in any of the amino acid sequences (1) to (15). These sequences are useful when the novel polypeptide is produced using an Escherichia coli strain. 
 It goes without saying that the above-mentioned preferred amino acid sequences may be added to each N-terminus, C-terminus or both termini of N- and C-termini. 
 Most preferred examples of the amino acid sequence of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention are shown in the SEQUENCE LISTING attached hereto as amino acids 1-68 or 1-70 of Sequence ID Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43. 
 The novel polypeptide according to the first aspect of the present invention may have a sugar chain. 
 Recent advances in the technology have rendered possible application of various chemical modifications polypeptides, such as alkylation, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and the like. Also, formation of a salt with a pharmacologically acceptable acid or base and linkage of polyethylene glycol or the like to a polypeptide from a drug delivery system (DDS) point of view are usually used techniques. In consequence, polypeptides to which such modifications are applied are also included in the novel polypeptide of the present invention. 
 Preferably, the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention may have at least a protease inhibition activity as one of its characteristic properties. The protease inhibition activity may preferably be inhibition of at least one of FXa, elastase and trypsin. 
 The novel polypeptide according to the first aspect of the present invention may be obtained by any means. For instance, it may be obtained by chemical synthesis using a peptide synthesizer (for example, model 431 manufactured by Applied Biosystems). It may be obtained also by known recombinant DNA techniques disclosed for instance by T. Maniatis et al. in Molecular Cloning, a laboratory manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1982), using a DNA fragment which encodes the novel polypeptide of the present invention. A preferred example of the production of the novel polypeptide of the present invention by means of recombinant DNA techniques will be described later in relation to the sixth and seventh aspect of the present invention. 
 Next, the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention is described. 
 The novel DNA fragment of the present invention contains, at least as a pare thereof, a nucleotide sequence which encodes the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention. In other words, the novel DNA fragment of the present invention is characterized in that it comprises a nucleotide sequence which encodes a polypeptide that contains, at least as a part thereof, an amino acid sequence resulting from substitution of a different amino acid for at lease one amino acid in the aforementioned amino acid sequence of  formula  1. 
 The phrase "a DNA fragment containing a nucleotide sequence as a part thereof" as used herein means that the DNA fragment may be defined either by the nucleotide sequence itself or by a nucleotide sequence in which the 5' end, the 3' end or both ends of the former nucleotide sequence is or are supplemented with one or more optional nucleotides. The novel DNA fragment of the present invention may have any nucleotide sequence, provided that the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention is produced in appropriate hose cells which have been transformed with the DNA fragment by an appropriate means. Since it is well known that multiple codons exist corresponding to one amino acid (for most amino acids), the nucleotide sequence which encodes the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention is not limited to a single sequence and, therefore, the nucleotide sequence of the novel DNA fragment of the present invention is also not limited to a single sequence. However, a nucleotide sequence which encodes the aforementioned amino acid sequence of  formula  1 may preferably have the following formula 2.

 It goes without saying that the above-mentioned preferred DNA sequences may be added to each 5' end, 3' end or both ends of 5' and 3' ends. 
 Most preferred examples of the nucleotide sequence of the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention are shown in the SEQUENCE LISTING attached hereto as Sequence ID Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33. 
 The novel DNA fragment of the present invention may be obtained by any means. For instance, it may be obtained by chemical synthesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. Chemical synthesis of the novel DNA fragment of the present invention may be effected, for example, in the following manner. First, a desired nucleotide sequence is designed and the thus designed DNA fragment is divided into appropriately sized small fragments. An oligomer which corresponds to each of the thus divided fragments is synthesized using an fully automatic DNA synthesizer (for example, model 394 manufactured by Applied Biosystems). The thus synthesized oligomer is subjected to annealing. If necessary, 5'-end phosphorylation is carried out using T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to the annealing step. Thereafter, the thus annealed fragments are subjected, if necessary, to ligation with T4 DNA ligase, and then cloned into an appropriate vector. 
 When the novel DNA fragment of the present invention is prepared by means of recombinant DNA techniques, it may be obtained by nucleotide sequence modification and DNA amplification making use of an appropriate cDNA library, a chromosomal DNA library or a DNA fragment which encodes the amino acid sequence of  formula  1, in accordance with usually used techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis (Kramer, W. et al., Nucleic Acid Res., vol. 12, pp. 9441-9456, 1984; Kunkel, T. A. et al., Methods in Enzymology, vol. 154, pp. 357-382, 1987) and polymerase chain reaction (to be referred to as "PCR" hereinafter) (PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, edited by Michael, A. I. et al., Academic Press, 1990). 
 A cDNA library or a chromosomal DNA library to be used may be chosen from commercially available articles, or prepared from appropriate tissues or cells according to usually used means (cf. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, edited by T. Maniatis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1982). A DNA fragment which encodes the amino acid sequence of  formula  1 may be obtained not only by chemical synthesis but also from an appropriate DNA library optionally making use of known recombinant DNA techniques such as hybridization (cf. Wallace, R. B. et al., Nucleic Acid Res., vol. 9, pp. 879-894, 1981). 
 On the basis of the disclosure of the novel DNA fragment of the present invention, its complementary DNA fragments and RNA fragments can also be obtained. The DNA fragment of the present invention may also include sequences linked to such a complementary DNA or RNA fragment. 
 According to the third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vector which contains the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention. 
 in addition to the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention, the vector of the present invention may further contain additional nucleotide sequences such as a promoter, a ribosome binding region, a signal peptide-encoding sequence, a selection marker sequence and the like, as well as a sequence which is used to amplify copy numbers of the DNA of interest. The vector of the present invention may be used for any purpose. For example, it may be used as an expression vector or as a cloning vector. 
 Vectors for expression use generally have a promoter, an optional ribosome binding region and other such sequences which are necessary for expression of genes. In the vector of the present invention, these necessary sequences are used by selecting them in such a way that they can function in host cells to be transformed with the vector. When a polypeptide expressed in the cells of a transformant is secreted outside the cells, a vector may generally contain a nucleotide sequence which encodes a signal peptide in addition to the above necessary sequences. In consequence, when the vector of the third aspect of the present invention is used as an expression vector, it may contain not only the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention but also those nucleotide sequences necessary for expression and, if required, a nucleotide sequence which encodes a signal peptide. 
 The vector of the third aspect of the present invention may be obtained by inserting the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention into an appropriate commercially available or known vector in accordance with usually used means (cf. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, edited by T. Maniatis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1982). The origin of the vector to be used for the insertion of the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention is not particularly limited. Such a vector may be selected from various virus vectors, plasmid vectors, phage vectors and the like, such as pUC118, pBR322, pEFN-BOS, λgt10, pKK223-3, YAC, Baculo virus vector and the like. If necessary, optional nucleotide sequences such as a ribosome binding region, a selection marker sequence and the like may be synthesized chemically and inserted into the vector together with the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention. Alternatively, the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention may be inserted into a commercially available vector which already contains these desired nucleotide sequences. 
 A most preferred vector of the present invention is a plasmid vector which contains at least a tryptophan promoter, a kanamycin or ampicillin resistant gene and the DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention. 
 According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transformant transformed with the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention. A transformant which can produce the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention is preferable as the transformant of the fourth aspect of the present invention. A transformant which either secrets the polypeptide outside the cell or which accumulates the polypeptide in the cell is preferable as the transformant of the fourth aspect of the present invention. 
 The transformant of the fourth aspect of the present invention may be obtained by introducing the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention into appropriate host cells in accordance with a usually used means such as a calcium chloride technique, a method in which a calcium phosphate-DNA complex is used, a microinjection technique, electroporation or the like. 
 Preferably, in addition to a nucleotide sequence encoding the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention, the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention to be used for the preparation of the transformant may contain additional nucleotide sequences which encode a promoter, a ribosome binding region and the like that are necessary for the expression of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention. If necessary, the DNA fragment to be used may contain a nucleotide sequence which encodes a signal peptide in addition to other necessary nucleotide sequences for the expression of the polypeptide. These promoter, ribosome binding region, signal peptide-encoding sequences and the like may be of various origins, provided that they can function in the host cells to be used. 
 Host cells to be used for the insertion of the novel DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention are not strictly limited, provided that they are suitable for use in the expression of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention. Such suitable host cells may be selected from either eukaryotic cells such as HeLa cells, Namalwa cells, COS cells, CHO cells, yeast cells, SF cells and the like or prokaryotic cells such as E. coli cells, Bacillus subtilis cells and the like. 
 According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a transformant transformed with the vector of the third aspect of the present invention. A transformant which can produce the novel polypeptide of the present invention is preferable as the transformant of the fifth aspect of the present invention. A transformant which either secrets the polypeptide outside the cell or which accumulates the polypeptide in the cell is preferable as the transformant of the fifth aspect of the present invention. 
 The transformant of the fifth aspect of the present invention is obtained by transforming an appropriate host cells with the vector of the third aspect of the present invention by a usually used means such as a calcium chloride technique, a rubidium chloride technique, Hanahan's method (Hanahan, D., Techniques for Transformation of E. coli; in DNA Cloning, vol. 1, Glover, D. M. (ed.), pp. 109.136, IRL Press, 1985) or the like. 
 Host cells to be used for the transformation by the vector of the third aspect of the present invention are not strictly limited, provided that they are suitable for use in the expression of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention. Such suitable hose cells may be selected from either eukaryotic cells such as HeLa cells, Namalwa cells, COS cells, CHO cells, yeast cells, SF cells and the like or prokaryotic cells such as E. coli cells, B. subtilis cells and the like. 
 As it is universally known, a host cell and a vector function mutually. Taking this into consideration, it is preferable to obtain the inventive transformant by selecting an appropriate origin of the vector, a nucleotide sequence necessary for expression in the vector and an appropriate host in such a combination that the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention can be expressed efficiently. 
 Illustrative examples of the combination of expression vector with host cells include: an expression vector containing the early promoter gene of simian virus 40 (SV40) with COS-7 cells; and an expression vector originated from plasmid pBR322 containing nucleotide sequences which encode a tryptophan promoter and a tryptophan SD sequence with E. coli HB101 cells. 
 As will be described later in Examples, the present inventors have prepared E. coli JE5505 transformants transformed with the vector of the third aspect of the present invention. These transformants have been deposited by the present inventors in the Patent Microorganisms Depositary Center of Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (1-1-1, Higashi, Yatabecho, Tsukuba-gun, Ibaraki, Japan). The following shows deposition numbers and names of these transformants.

 The following describes sixth and seventh aspects of the present invention, concerning processes suitable for the production of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention, to which recombinant DNA techniques are applied. 
 According to the sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention which comprises the steps of: 
 a) preparing a DNA fragment containing a nucleotide sequence which encodes the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention, 
 b) preparing a transformant by transforming host cells with the DNA fragment obtained in the above step a), and 
 c) culturing the transformant obtained in the above step b) to allow the transformant to produce the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention and subsequently recovering said polypeptide from the cultured medium. 
 In the above step a), the phrase "a DNA fragment containing a nucleotide sequence which encodes the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention" preferably means a DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention Preferably this DNA fragment may further contain a nucleotide sequence which is necessary for the expression of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention, in addition to a nucleotide sequence that encodes said novel polypeptide. If necessary, said DNA fragment may also contain a nucleotide sequence which encodes a signal peptide. 
 The transformant obtained in the above step b) belongs preferably to the transformant of the fourth aspect of the present invention, and it can therefore be obtained by the process described in the foregoing in relation to the fourth aspect of the present invention. 
 The thus obtained transformant in the above step b) is used in the subsequent step c). Culturing of the transformant may be effected by generally used means for the culturing of microorganisms or mammalian cells, in accordance with the procedure disclosed for instance in Seibutsu Kagaku Kogaku (or Biochemical Engineering; S. Aiba et al., 1976, Tokyo University Press) or in Soshiki Baiyo (or Tissue Culture; J. Nakai et al., 1976, Asakura Shoten). 
 Next, the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention thus produced by the transformant is recovered from the cultured medium of said transformant. In this instance, the thus produced novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention may be isolated preferably from the cultured cells of the transformant when the product is not secreted extracellularly, or from culture supernatant when secreted into the medium. Purification and recovery of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention from a cultured broth containing said polypeptide may be carried out in the light of various generally used means for the purification of polypeptides which have been disclosed in many reports and books such as Seikagaku Jikken Koza (or Biochemical Experiments; vol. I, Protein Chemistry, 1976, edited by The Japanese Biochemical Society, Tokyo Kagaku Dojin). When the polypeptide of the present invention forms an inclusion body inside the transformant cells, it is preferable to carry solubilization, denaturation and refolding in its purification (of. Thomas E. Creighton, J. Mol. Biol., vol. 87, pp. 563-577, 1974). 
 Examples of protein purification techniques include ammonium sulfate precipitation, ultrafiltration, isoelectric precipitation, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, various affinity chromatographic techniques such as hydrophobic chromatography, antibody chromatography and the like, chromatofocusing, absorption chromatography and reverse phase chromatography. Consequently, recovery and purification of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention may be carried out by selecting suitable ones from these techniques and, if necessary, making use of an HPLC system and the like, in appropriate order of the techniques. 
 According to the seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention which comprises the steps of: 
 a) preparing a DNA fragment containing a nucleotide sequence which encodes the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention, 
 b) constructing a vector containing the DNA fragment obtained in the above step a) 
 c) preparing a transformant by transforming host cells with the vector obtained in the above step b), and 
 d) culturing the transformant obtained in the above step c) to allow the transformant to produce the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention and subsequently recovering said polypeptide from the cultured medium. 
 In the above step a), the term "a DNA fragment containing a nucleotide sequence which encodes the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention" preferably means a DNA fragment of the second aspect of the present invention. 
 The vector obtained in the above step b) is preferably the vector of the third aspect of the present invention. More preferably, the vector obtained in the above step b) is a vector which further contains a nucleotide sequence necessary for the expression of the polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention, in addition to a nucleotide sequence that encodes said polypeptide. If necessary, said vector may also contain a nucleotide sequence which encodes a signal peptide. A process for the construction of such a vector has already been described in the foregoing in relation to the third aspect of the present invention. 
 The transformant thus obtained in the above step c) belongs preferably to the transformant of the fifth aspect of the present invention, and it can therefore be obtained by the process described in the foregoing in relation to the fifth aspect of the present invention. 
 The thus obtained transformant in the above step c) is used in the subsequent step d). Processes for the culturing of the transformant and subsequent recovery and purification of the novel polypeptide of the present invention from the cultured medium are the same as those described in the foregoing in relation to the sixth aspect of the present invention. 
 Thus, processes for the production of the novel polypeptide have been described with respect to the sixth and seventh aspects of the present invention. In the practice of these processes, a DNA fragment which contains a fused nucleotide sequence consisting of a nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention and another nucleotide sequence encoding another polypeptide (E. coliβ-galactosidase for example) or a part thereof may be used as the DNA fragment that contains a nucleotide sequence encoding the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention. In such an instance, a transformant transformed with said DNA fragment or with a vector prepared therefrom will produce a fused polypeptide consisting of the novel polypeptide of the present invention and another polypeptide (E. coli62 -galactosidase for example). In that case, it is possible to obtain the novel polypeptide of the first aspect of the present invention by recovering said fused polypeptide and then treating it with appropriate chemical compounds, enzymes and the like to cue out and remove the additional polypeptide portion, followed by purification if necessary. 
 Next, the drug composition of the eighth aspect of the present invention is described.

 Example 1 
 Construction of plasmid pM469 
 Plasmid pM469 to be used later in Example 2 as an expression vector was prepared from plasmid pM463 by the following method. Plasmid pM463 used herein as the starting material is a derivative of plasmid pBR322, which contains a nucleotide sequence for the replication in E. coli cells, an ampicillin resistance gene, a tryptophan promoter, a nucleotide sequence coding for an alkaline phosphatase signal peptide and a nucleotide sequence encoding a human pancreatic secretion trypsin inhibitor (to be referred to as "PSTI" hereinafter) (Kanamori, T. et al., Gene, vol. 66, pp. 295--300, 1988). 
 First, plasmid pM463 was double-digested with restriction endonucleases HindIII and NruI and the resulting mixture of DNA fragments was electrophorsed on a 0.7% agarose gel. A DNA fragment of about 3.4 kb thus isolated by the electrophoresis was absorbed to diethylaminoethyl cellulose paper (to be referred to as "DEAE cellulose paper" hereinafter) and then extracted with a high concentration salt solution (2M NaCl/10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5)/1 mM EDTA) to recover the DNA fragment of about 3.4 kb. 
 Separately from this, a linker consisting of an SD sequence, a nucleotide sequence encoding an E. coli alkaline phosphatase signal peptide and a nucleotide sequence encoding a part of N-terminal side amino acid sequence of PSTI was divided into six designed fragments (FIG. 1, SEQ. I.D. NOS.:44-49). Each of the thus designed fragments was synthesized using a chemical synthesizer (381A, Applied Biosystems, Inc.) (cf. FIG. 1). Of these 6 fragments thus synthesized, S34, S35, S18 and S19 were subjected to 5'-end phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) in the presence of ATP. Subsequently, each of the combinations of S33 with phosphorylated S34, phosphorylated S35 with phosphorylated S18 and phosphorylated S19 with S20 was subjected to annealing, followed by their ligation making use of a DNA ligation kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). The thus ligated sample was then electrophoresed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel to separate and extract a DNA fragment (linker 1) of about 100 bp which was subsequently purified by phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation. The thus obtained DNA fragment of about 100 bp and the aforementioned DNA fragment of about 3.4 kb were ligated, and E. coli HB101 was transformed with the thus ligated product to isolate an ampicillin-resistant colony as a transformant of interest. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the thus obtained transformant and named plasmid pM468 (cf. FIG. 2). 
 The thus obtained plasmid pM468 was double-digested with EcoRI and DraI, and a DNA fragment of about 2.4 kb was isolated and recovered using DEAE cellulose paper in the same manner as described above. Separately from this, plasmid pKC7 containing a kanamycin resistance gene (km r ) (Ngarajarao, R. et al., Gene, vol. 7, pp. 79-82, 1979) was double-digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRi and SmaI to prepare a DNA fragment of about 1.4 kb containing the kanamycin resistance gene. The thus obtained DNA fragment of about 1.4 kb and the aforementioned DNA fragment of about 2.4 kb were ligated, and E. coli HB101 was transformed with the thus ligated product to isolate a kanamycin-resistant colony as a transformant of interest. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the thus obtained transformant and named plasmid pM469 (cf. FIG. 3).

 (1) Cloning of DNA fragment 
 A DNA fragment encoding the polypeptide Y46E was prepared by means of site-directed mutagenesis (cf. Kunkel, T. A. et al., Methods in Enzymology, vol. 154, p. 367, 1987) using plasmid pM552 (cf. Japanese Patent Application No. 3-325220). The pM552 is a plasmid which has been constructed by inserting into plasmid pM469 a nucleotide sequence that encodes a polypeptide TN70 represented by the following amino acid sequence of  formula  3, that is, a DNA fragment (TN70 DNA) represented by the following nucleotide sequence of  formula  4. The plasmid pM552 contains a tryptophan promoter, a nucleotide sequence coding for an alkaline phosphatase signal peptide and a kanamycin resistance gene (cf. FIG. 4).

 First, plasmid pM552 was double-digested with HindIII and BamHI, and the thus digested fragments were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. A DNA fragment of about 310 bp containing the nucleotide sequence of  formula  4 was extracted from the agarose gel and then purified by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation. Using T4 DNA ligase (already described in the foregoing), the thus obtained DNA fragment of about 310 bp was ligated with a phage vector M13mp18 which has been double-digested with HindIII and BamHI in advance. Thereafter, the thus ligated product was transfected into E. coli JM109 cells (transfection) to obtain M13 phage. 
 Next, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out making use of a Mutan™-K kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. ) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. That is, an E. coli strain BW313 (HfrKL16PO/45 [lysA(61-62)], dutl, ung1, thi-1, relA1) provided with the kit as an indicator strain was infected with the M13 phage to obtain phage plaques. A single plaque was inoculated into 2×YT medium using the BW313 as an indicator strain and cultured at 37° C. for 6 hours. Thereafter, single stranded DNA (ssDNA) was extracted and purified from the resulting phage culture broth by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation. Separately from this, Y46E primer (FIG. 5, SEQ. I.D. NO.:50) for mutagenesis use was synthesized using the aforementioned chemical synthesizer and purified using an OPC column (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), and the 5'-end of the thus purified oligomer Y46E was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP. The thus phosphorylated oligomer was subjected to annealing with the just obtained ssDNA by incubating them at 65° C. for 15 minutes and then at 37° C. for 15 minutes. The resulting reaction mixture was then incubated at 25° C. for 2 hours in the presence of E. coli DNA ligase and T4 DNA polymerase provided with the Mutan™-K kit to synthesize a complementary chain. After terminating the reaction with EDTA, the resulting complementary chain was transfected into E. coli BMH 71-18 (mutS (Δ(lac-proAB), thi, supE, mutS215::Tn10(tet r )/F' traD36, proAB lacI q , lacZΔM15)) provided with the kit, and phage plaques were obtained using JM109 as an indicator strain. Phage particles were recovered from each single plaque thus obtained and cultured using JM109 as an indicator strain to obtain a phage solution from which ssDNA was extracted and purified by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation. Thereafter, the nucleotide sequence of each ssDNA sample was determined using a DNA sequencer (370A, Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to select an ssDNA sample into which the desired mutation had been introduced. 
 Next, PCR was carried out in the following method, using the thus obtained ssDNA as a template. That is, a ScaI primer (FIG. 6, SEQ. I.D. NO.:51) to be used as a sense primer and a BamHI primer (FIG. 7, SEQ. I.D. NO.:52) to be used as an antisense primer were synthesized using the aforementioned chemical synthesizer and then purified using the aforementioned OPC column. The thus obtained ScaI sense primer and BamHI antisense primer were added to a 100 μl solution containing the aforementioned ssDNA, and the resulting mixture was subjected to the PCR reaction using Gene Amp® PCR Reagent Kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) by repeating 30 cycles of the reaction. In this instance, each reaction cycle was effected by a series of incubation at 94° C. for 1 minute, 55° C. for 2 minutes and 72° C. for 3 minutes in that order. Thereafter, the DNA fragment of the present invention was purified from the resulting reaction mixture by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation. 
 (2) Construction of expression vector 
 Plasmid pM469 obtained in Example 1 was double-digested with ScaI and BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragments were subjected to 0.7% low melting agarose gel electrophoresis. A DNA fragment of about 3.5 kb was purified from the agarose gel by cutting out a gel portion containing the fragment, melting the cut out gel portion at 65° C. and then treating the resulting solution with phenol, followed by ethanol precipitation. Next, the DNA fragment of the present invention obtained in the above procedure (1) was digested with BamHI and then ligated with the just obtained DNA fragment of about 3.5 kb to obtain an expression plasmid pM575B (cf. FIG. 8). 
 The thus obtained plasmid pM575B was double-digested with HindIII and BamHI, and a DNA fragment of interest having a size of about 310 bp was extracted and purified by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation. The thus purified DNA fragment was ligated with each of the phage vectors M13mp18 and M13mp19 (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) which have been double-digested with HindIII and BamHI in advance, and each of the ligated products was transfected into E. coli JM109 to form plaques. Thereafter, ssDNA was prepared from each of the resulting plaques and subjected to sequencing using a DNA sequencer (370A, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The thus confirmed nucleotide sequence of a region of plasmid pM575B from its HindIII site to its BamHI site containing the DNA fragment of interest and its corresponding amino acid sequence are shown in FIG. 9 (see SEQ. I.D. NO.:1 in the SEQUENCE LISTING). 
 (3) Preparation and culturing of transformant 
 A transformant, E. coli JE5505 (pM575B), was prepared by transforming E. coli JE5505 with the plasmid pM575B obtained in the above procedure (2) in accordance with the Hanahan's method (Hanahan D., Techniques for Transformation of E. coli; in DNA Cloning, vol. 1, Glover, D .M. (ed.) , pp. 109-136, IRL Press, 1985). The thus prepared transformant, E. coli JE5505 (pM575B), was cultured at 37° C. for about 8 hours in L-broth containing 50 μ/ml of kanamycin (first seed culture). The resulting culture broth was inoculated in about 100 volumes of the same medium and cultured overnight at 37° C. (second seed culture). The main culture was then carried out by inoculating the resulting culture broth in 50 volumes of M9CA medium containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin and culturing at 37° C. for about 1 hour. After adding 3-β-indole acrylic acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, the culturing was continued for additional 16 hours. Thereafter, culture filtrate was obtained from the resulting culture broth by centrifugation. 
 The culture filtrate thus prepared was diluted with 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin)/0.2M triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) to each predetermined concentration, and the diluted samples were used for the measurement of trypsin-inhibiting activity in accordance with the procedure described in Example 17 (1). In this instance, culture filtrate of a transformant, E. coli JE5505 (pM553), was used as a control in the activity measurement, which has been obtained by deleting the aforementioned nucleotide sequence of  formula  4 from plasmid pM552 to obtain a plasmid pM553 and by transforming E. coli JE5505 with the thus obtained plasmid pM553. 
 Markedly high trypsin-inhibiting activity was found in the culture filtrate of E. coli JE5505 (pM575B) in comparison with the control. The transformant E. coli JE5505 (pM575B) has been deposited by the present inventors on Jul. 16, 1991, in the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, and has been assigned the designation FERM P-12357 which was subsequently transferred to the International Depositary Authority on Oct. 17, 1991, as FERM BP-3613. 
 (4) Purification of inventive polypeptide from culture supernatant of E. coli JE5505 (pM575B) 
 The novel polypeptide of the present invention was recovered and purified from culture supernatant of the transformant E. coil JE5505 (pM575B) obtained in the above procedure (3) by the following method. 
 (a) Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation 
 Ammonium sulfate was added to one liter of the culture supernatant to a level of 80% saturation. The mixture was stirred until ammonium sulfate was completely dissolved and then the solution was allowed to stand overnight at 4° C. The sample was cetrifuged at 12,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C., and the thus obtained pellet was dissolved in 25 ml of distilled water. After removing the insoluble precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated to 1 ml using an ultrafiltration membrane (molecular weight cutoff of 1,000; Diaflow membrane YM-1, Grace Company). Thereafter, the thus concentrated sample was centrifuged at 5,860×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. to recover supernatant. 
 (b) Gel filtration 
 The concentrated sample obtained in the above step (a) was applied to a column (1 cm.o slashed.×115 cm) packed with Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated with PBS -  (phosphate buffered saline). The loaded sample was eluted with PBS -  at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min to obtain 2 ml fractions. 
 A portion of each fraction was collected and checked for its trypsin-inhibiting activity in accordance with the procedure described in Example 17 (1). Thereafter, active fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4° C. against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) using a dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff of 1,000; Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.). 
 (c) Anion exchange chromatography 
 Anion exchange chromatography was carried out using an FPLC system (Pharmacia) using the following method. The dialyzed sample obtained in the above step (b) was applied to Mono Q column (5 mm.o slashed.×50 mm, Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.4M NaCl/20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5)/48 min. Protein concentration in the eluent was monitored by absorbance an 280 nm and each protein peak was collected. A portion of each collected fraction was checked for its trypsin-inhibiting activity in accordance with the procedure described in Example 17 (1) and active fractions were pooled. 
 (d) Reverse phase chromatography 
 The active fraction pooled in the above sled (c) was applied to a Vydac C18 column (4.6 mm.o slashed.×25.0 cm, The Separations Group) which had been equilibrated with 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid solution. Using a Waters 625 LC system (Waters Associates, Inc.), elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear density gradient of 0 to 100% acetonitrile/0.04% trifluoroacetic acid/30 min. Protein concentration in the eluent was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and each protein peak was collected. A portion of each fraction was checked for its trypsin-inhibiting activity in accordance with the procedure described in Example 17 (1) and active fractions were pooled. The pooled sample was dried under reduced pressure using a centrifugation vacuum concentrator (Tomy Seiko Co., Ltd.) to obtain a purified polypeptide sample. The purified polypeptide was used for the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the following step (5), the amino acid sequence analysis in the step (6) and the activity measurement in Example 12. 
 (5) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
 The purified polypeptide sample obtained in the above procedure (4) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (to be referred to as "SDS-PAGE" hereinafter) in accordance with Laemmli's method (Laemmli, U. K., Nature, vol. 227, pp. 680-685, 1970). That is, the purified polypeptide was dissolved in 100 μl of distilled water, and a portion of the solution was mixed with the same volume of Seprasol II (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.). The mixture was treated at 100° C. for 5 minutes and then electrophoresed with 15% gel (8 cm×9 cm, 1 mm in thickness) at 15 mA for 50 minutes and then at 30 mA for 35 minutes. In this instance, a commercial molecular weight marker kit was used (Electrophoresis Calibration Kit, Pharmacia). After the electrophoresis, staining was carried out with a commercial silver staining kit (2D-Silver Staining Reagent II, Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd.). The purified sample showed a single band by SDS-PAGE. 
 (6) Determination of amino acid sequence 
 The purified polypeptide sample obtained in the above procedure (4) was dissolved in 50% acetic acid solution and its amino acid sequence was determined using Model 477A Protein Sequencing System 120A PTH Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Identification of the amino acid sequence was determined by detecting PTH-amino acid at an absorbance of 270 nm, based on the retention time of standard PTH-amino acids (Applied Biosystems Inc.) which have been isolated in the same procedure. 
 As a results, it was confirmed that the purified polypeptide sample obtained in the above procedure (4) was the polypeptide of interest, Y46E (cf. amino acids 1-70 of SEQ. I.D. No.:2 in SEQUENCE LISTING).

Next, ssDNA was prepared using M13 phage obtained in Example 2 (1) from E. coli JM109, in the same manner as in Example 2 (1) making use of the aforementioned Mutan™-K kit, and the desired mutation was introduced into the ssDNA using the TV12DD. Thereafter, PCR was carried out in accordance with the procedure described in Example 2 (1) using the thus mutation-introduced ssDNA as a template. In this instance, ScaI sense primer prepared in Example 2 (1) was used as the sense primer and an M13 primer RV (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. ) was used as the antisense primer.

First PCR was carried out making use of the aforementioned Gene Amp® PCR Reagent Kit, using the thus synthesized sense and antisense primers and plasmid pM558 as a template and repeating 30 cycles of the reaction. In this instance, each reaction cycle was effected by a series of incubations at 94° C. for 1 minute, 55° C. for 2 minutes and 72° C. for 3 minutes in that order. A portion of the amplified product, of the first PCR was applied to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm formation of a DNA fragment of interest having a size of about 160 bp. The DNA fragment of interest was then extracted and purified from the gel by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation, and the thus purified DNA fragment was dissolved in TE buffer. Thereafter, a second PCR was carried out in the same manner as the above first PCR using the thus dissolved DNA fragment as a sense primer and the plasmid DM558 as a template. In this instance, a pBR BamHI primer (FIG. 13, SEQ. I.D. NO.:56) prepared as in Example 2-(2), obtained by chemical synthesis was used as an antisense primer. 
 A portion of the amplified product of the second PCR was applied to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm formation of a DNA fragment of interest having a size of about 350 bp. The DNA fragment was then extracted and purified from the gel by means of phenol treatment and ethanol precipitation to obtain the DNA fragment of the present invention.

 Polypeptides R11N/Q19K/Y46D, R11S/Q19K/Y46D and R11A/Q19K/Y46D having an amino acid sequence derived from the  aforementioned formula  1 amino acid sequence by substituting Ash, Ser and Ala for the 7 position Arg, respectively, in addition to substituting Lys for the 15 position Gln and Asp for the 42 position Tyr of the  formula  1 sequence counting from its N-terminus side were prepared by the following method. 
 That is, DNA fragments which have a nucleotide sequence coding the amino acid sequence of polypeptides R11N/Q19K/Y46D, R11S/Q19K/Y46D, R11A/Q19K/Y46D (cf. SEQ. I.D. NO.:41, 42, and 43 respectively, were prepared by the site-directed mutagenesis, the method of Landt et. al. The thus obtained DNA fragments were inserted into the aforementioned plasmid pM463 in accordance with the procedure described in Example 3 (2) to obtain the expression plasmid pM764, pM765, pM767 and sequencing was carried out in the same manner as described in Example 2 (2). 
 The confirmed nucleotide sequences of each region of plasmid pM764, pM765 and pM767 from their HindIII sites to their BamHI sites containing novel DNA fragments of the present invention and those corresponding amino acid sequences are shown in Sequence I.D. Nos. 29, 31 and 33 in the SEQUENCE LISTING. E. coli JE5505 were transformed with the plasmid pM764, pM765 and pM767 respectively, in accordance with Hanahan's method. And then transformants, E. coli JE5505 (pM764) , E. coli JE5505 (pM765) , E. coli JE5505 (pM767) were isolated and cultured in the same manner as described in Example 3 (3). A portion of the cultured medium of each transformant was centrifuged to obtain supernatant and to check its trypsin-inhibiting activity in accordance with the procedure of Example 17 (1) . 
 All of the obtained supernatant showed about 4 times higher trypsin-inhibiting activity in comparison with that of E. coli JE5505 (pM727). In consideration of the specific activity of these polypeptides in bovine trypsin inhibition, it was confirmed that these substitutions of 7 position counting from N-terminus of the amino  acid sequence formula  1 provides for efficient secretion of this polypeptide from a transformant.

After incubating statically at 37° C. for 10 minutes, 100 μl of the S-2222 solution was added no start the reaction. The reaction was carried out at 37° C. for 30 minutes and then stopped by adding 50 μl of 50% acetic acid solution to the reaction mixture. Thereafter, absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. In this instance, in order to eliminate absorbancy of various contents in the reaction mixture other than the reaction product, a blank solution was prepared by mixing 25 μl of the FXa solution with 50 μl of 50% acetic acid and then with 25 μl of each test sample or the control solution, 100 μl of the 0.1% BSA/150 mM NaCl/5 mM CACl 2  /50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) and with 100 μl of the S-2222 solution.
