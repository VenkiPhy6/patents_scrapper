 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to a kind of new probiotics TCI633, and treatment of arthritis medicinal combination is used for containing the probiotics
Purposes in terms of being used to prepare treatment of arthritis or slowing down the medicine of arthritis ache of object and the probiotics and for
The purposes of medicine aspect for increasing cartilage cell or protecting cartilage cell is prepared, belongs to biomedicine field. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Clinically, arthritis is broadly divided into osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, urarthritis, bacillary pass
Save inflammation etc., the arthritic symptom of each type and predilection site are all not quite similar, and osteoarthritis is then one of the most common one
Kind.Osteoarthritis is a kind of joint disease of degeneration, and the articular cartilage of patient is encroached on, in addition to patient pain is caused,
There are the symptoms such as stiff, swelling and deformation, if the lasting progress of this symptom, it is also possible to cause patient's moving difficulty and need crutch or wheel
The assistance of chair. 
 Under general scenario, the osteoarthritis main damage joint that often activity and needs bear a heavy burden, such as knee joint, hip close
Section, finger interphalangeal joint, lumbar vertebrae and cervical vertebra etc..The therapeutic modality of osteoarthritis, the originally treatments for adopting Non-surgical more, including：
Drug therapy, recovery treating or injection sodium hyaluronate.If can not still slow down the symptom of patient in the above described manner, just using perform the operation as
The means for the treatment of. 
 In drug treatment, steroid medicine can be used, analgesic effect is quick and notable, but its side effect also phase
When big, for example, osteoporosis can be generated, wound is not easy to heal, thinning of skin, upper gastrointestinal bleeding etc. or even can aggravate high blood
Pressure, the state of an illness of diabetes, therefore, most of situation has all been stopped using at present, but for certain rheumatoid arthritis, red
For spot lupus, stiff property spondylitis or Spinal Trauma patient, still need to using steroids alleviate the state of an illness.It may replace steroids
The drug of drug has nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs and gucosamine.At present, the use of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs is fairly common, analgesic effect
Fruit is also all good, but is used for a long time and still has side effect, such as the damage etc. of peptic ulcer, edema of lower extremity, renal function, therefore
Reasonable care is also needed using upper.Further, since gucosamine can stimulate intra-articular cartilage cell to synthesize glucoprotein, and have simultaneously
The effect that has anti-inflammatory analgetic, the side effect without nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, many patients are also treated using such mode, but due to it
The difference of dosage and absorbability, gucosamine have no apparent effect for many patients. 
 On the other hand, then can be slowed down in intraarticular injection sodium hyaluronate as a kind of lubricant with helping joint motion
Symptom.Though sodium hyaluronate can inhibit some inflammatory responses, the effect of slowing down for pain is limited, although making without pair
With, but in vivo, as long as a few weeks longer will be absorbed by the body, persistence is not high. 
 When aforementioned non-operative treatment mode can not all improve patient symptom and mitigate pain, can only carry out with intrusive mood
Operative treatment, such as using arthrocsopic surgery, remove the foreign matter in articular cavity or repaired to impaired cartilage, but its for
Effect is extremely limited for quite serious patient for joint injury.If directly replacing with joint prosthesis, though it can avoid sending out
Scorching, reduction pain, but joint prosthesis also has its service life, if using the simple metal or ceramics of longer life, needs great number
Expense. 
 Therefore, if a kind of drug and its medical composition can be found, be free from side effects, and it is sustainable act, it is special
Be not the pain for being capable of reduction of patient, and can by it is most economical, without operative treatment in a manner of reach treatment of arthritis the effect of,
It will be the big Gospel of arthritic.

Method carries out multiple group difference and compares.When P values are less than 0.05, represent that there were significant differences, it is for statistical analysis. 
 
 
 1 rear foot of embodiment, which bears a heavy burden to be distributed, changes (weight bearing) 
 The heavy burden of the foot of Degenerative joint and the foot of offside control group distribution is caused to change after anterior cruciate ligament excision (ACLT)
Represent one of pain index of osteoarthritis (Bove et al, 2006).Biped balance pain threshold detector (Dual Channel
Weight Averager, Singa Technology Corporation, Taiwan) it can be used to test big white mouse or so rear foot
The weight of force.Big white mouse is placed in an acclive pipeline, left and right feet station is stood on can measure point that left and right foot applies weight respectively
From on amount scale, after rat stable posture and standing are stablized, apparatus measures key is pressed, the data after noting down three seconds, as a result with just
Normal limb (left foot) subtracts the bipod heavy burden mathematic interpolation (Fernihough, et al., 2004) of injured limb (right crus of diaphragm), in animal row
Based on value measure with anterior cruciate ligament resection operation after the 1st to the 24th week, weekly measure once, the results are shown in Figure 1. 
 As shown in Figure 1, in terms of ACLT induces back leg heavy burden distribution change, ACLT groups were compared with control group, in the 1st week
Change the difference for having and significantly rising to rear foot heavy burden distribution in the 24th week.After arthritis model is induced, ACLT+TCI633 (5x
10 11 CFU/ kg/days) group and ACLT groups relatively on, be distributed what change was decreased significantly in the heavy burden of the 9th week to the 24th week its rear foot
Difference.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group with ACLT groups relatively on, in the 10th week to the 24th week its rear foot
Distribution of bearing a heavy burden changes the difference being decreased significantly.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) it organizes compared with ACLT groups
On, the difference for being distributed and changing and being decreased significantly of bearing a heavy burden in the 13rd week to the 19th week with the 22nd week its rear foot.Wherein in the 9th Zhou Zhi
At 24 weeks, the rear foot bears a heavy burden distribution change in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) and ACLT+TCI633 (5x
10 11 CFU/ kg/days) it organizes and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) relatively under, the difference that is more decreased significantly.
Therefore, can confirm based on the above results, probiotics TCI633 induces the rear foot for ACLT and bears a heavy burden what distribution change was significantly improved
Effect, while dose-dependent effect is presented.And after feeding TCI633 is stopped, as shown in table 1, in ACLT+TCI633 each groups pair
Rear foot heavy burden distribution change behavior analgesic effect percentage (%) has the tendency that trend slows down.

 2 thermal paraesthesia of embodiment tests (thermal hyperalgesia) 
 Thermal paraesthesia test is mode the putting with low energy that Hargreaves et al. is copied to be established in 1988
Penetrating property thermal light source irradiation animals' pad measures its recedence time.Hyperthermalgesia behavior be with hot pedal plate method (plantar test) into
Row analysis.Heat source stimulating instrument (Plantar Stimulator Analgesia Meter) (Life IITC Model 390,
Woodland Hills, CA, USA.) heat source sets intensity as 25, in order to avoid big white mouse sole tissue is because long-time is by heat
Source is injured, therefore it is stop time point (Hargreaves et al., 1988) to set irradiation 30 seconds.Rat is placed in acryl glass
On glass platform, using heat source stimulation big white mouse hind paw centre position, observe and record when its sole lifts off table top, in animal
The the 1st to the 24th week after the measurement of behavior base value and anterior cruciate ligament resection operation, measure once weekly, the results are shown in Figure 2. 
 As shown in Figure 2, ACLT groups compare with control group (control, normal group), without significantly after the 0th week to the 24th week
Change the difference of thermal paraesthesia.After arthritis model is induced, tri- groups of ACLT+TCI633 and ACLT groups relatively on also without
Significantly change the difference of thermal paraesthesia.Therefore, result above is summed up it has been confirmed that probiotics TCI633 after operation for luring
Present similar to control group without the difference for significantly changing thermal paraesthesia, numerical value in hair osteoarthritis.And stopping feeding
Also without significant impact after probiotics TCI633. 
 
 
 3 mechanicalness hyperaphia of embodiment (mechanical allodynia) 
 Method in publishing thesis according to Chaplan et al. in 1994, assessment probiotics TCI633 lure ACLT
Send out the hyperaphic influence of mechanicalness.Rat is fitted by being put unexpectedly in 15 points in brown acryl box that rat is placed on wire netting
It should.With Fan Furuisi (Von Frey filaments, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) from lower to upper to rat after
Sole applies press perpendicular power, and pressure grams is gradually increased since 1g and is, and note down its number pressure until rat generates contracting business concern operating a porters' service
Value is as paw withdrawal threshold value.It is at most for 5 seconds to apply pressure every time, and duplicate measurements 3 times is to ensure data accuracy, and thorn every time
Swash interval 15 seconds or more (Chaplan et al., 1994), the results are shown in Figure 3. 
 From the figure 3, it may be seen that ACLT groups compared with control group (control, normal group), in the 6th week to the 24th week its paw withdrawal
The difference that the threshold of reaction is decreased significantly.After arthritis model is induced, in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 11 CFU/ kg/days)
Group with ACLT groups relatively on, have the difference significantly risen in the 9th week to the 24th week its paw withdrawal threshold of reaction.In ACLT+TCI633
(5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group with ACLT groups relatively on, in the 9th week, to the 23rd week, its paw withdrawal threshold of reaction had notable rising
Difference.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) group with ACLT groups relatively on, in the 13rd week to the 22nd week its contract
The sufficient threshold of reaction has the difference significantly risen.Wherein when the 9th week to the 22nd week, the paw withdrawal threshold of reaction is in ACLT+TCI633
(5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 11 CFU/ kg/days) it organizes and ACLT+TCI633 (5x
10 9 CFU/ kg/days) relatively under, the effect that is more decreased significantly.Therefore, sum total result above is it has been confirmed that probiotics
The effect that TCI633 is significantly improved for ACLT inductions mechanicalness hyperaphia, while dose-dependent effect is presented.And stopping
Only after feeding TCI633 (the 21st week to the 24th week), as shown in table 2, in ACLT+TCI633 each groups to mechanicalness hyperaphia row
Have the tendency that trend slows down for analgesic effect percentage (%).

 The measurement (knee swelling) of 4 knee joint width swelling of embodiment 
 The knee joint change width of the 1st to the 24th week after (basline) and operation before anterior cruciate ligament resection operation
It measures weekly once, to assess knee inflammation situation.After rat is anaesthetized with 2.5%isofurane, with vernier scale
(calipers, AA847R, Aesculap, AG＆CO, KG, German) measures rat or so knee width, observes its left and right foot knee
Joint width, and record changes situation (Yang et al., 2014) in detail.As a result it is (left normal limb to be subtracted with injured limb (right crus of diaphragm)
Foot) bipod knee joint width differential as calculate, as shown in Figure 4. 
 As shown in Figure 4, ACLT groups are wide in left and right knee joint in the 1st week to the 24th week compared with control group (control)
Degree difference has the difference significantly risen.After arthritis model is induced, ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 11 CFU/ kg/days) group with
ACLT groups relatively on, in the difference that the 9th week to the 24th week its left and right knee joint width difference is decreased significantly.In ACLT+
TCI633(5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group with ACLT groups relatively on, in the 8th week to the 11st week and the 14th week to the 22nd week its
The difference that left and right knee joint width difference is decreased significantly.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) group and ACLT
It organizes on relatively, in the difference that the 13rd week to the 22nd week its left and right knee joint width difference is decreased significantly.Wherein in the 8th Zhou Zhi
At 22 weeks, left and right knee joint width difference is in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) and ACLT+TCI633 (5x
10 11 CFU/ kg/days) it organizes and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) relatively under, the difference that is more decreased significantly.
Therefore, result above is summed up it has been confirmed that probiotics TCI633 induces left and right knee joint width difference for ACLT has and significantly change
Kind effect, while dose-dependent effect is presented.And after feeding TCI633 is stopped, it is as shown in table 3, each in ACLT+TCI633
Group has the tendency that trend slows down to the inhibition percentage (%) of knee joint swelling.

 The measurement of 5 weight of embodiment 
 The the 1st to the 24th week rat of measure weekly after (basline) and operation before anterior cruciate ligament resection operation
Weight, the results are shown in Figure 5. 
 As shown in Figure 5, ACLT groups compared with control group (control, normal group), in the weight of the 0th week to the 24th week
Variation does not make significant difference, and the trend put on weight at any time is presented.After arthritis model is induced, ACLT+TCI633 (5x
10 11 CFU/ kg/days) group with ACLT groups relatively on, the changes of weight in the 0th week to the 24th week does not make significant difference, and also present
The trend put on weight at any time.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group with ACLT groups relatively on, in the 8th week
Have the tendency that with its weight gain in the 11st week to the 24th week significantly less.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days)
Group and ACLT groups relatively on, had the tendency that in the 8th week with its weight gain in the 10th week to the 24th week notable less.Therefore, it sums up
Result above it has been confirmed that probiotics TCI633 in changes of weight in ACLT patterns, in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 With
5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) group significantly slows weight gain.

 Assess influences of the probiotics TCI633 for the inflammation of knee joint synovial tissue 
 As shown in fig. 6, rat receive the anterior cruciate ligament place of cutting operation after, with control group relatively on, in the 24th Zhou Keming
Aobvious the phenomenon that observing the infiltration of inflammatory blood cell, hyperblastosis and tissue hyperplasia in synovial tissue.In treatment group partly, exist
ACLT+TCI633(5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) also observe that the phenomenon that being similar to ACLT groups.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x
10 11 CFU/ kg/days) and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) in group, observable is compared with minor irritation blood
Ball infiltrates, while is effectively improved hyperblastosis caused by the anterior cruciate ligament place of cutting performs the operation and the phenomenon that tissue hyperplasia.Therefore, it sums up
Result above it has been confirmed that probiotics TCI633 in ACLT patterns, in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 11 CFU/ kg/days)
With ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group significantly slows synovial tissue's inflammation. 
 Assess influences of the probiotics TCI633 for knee cartilage tissue 
 Analyzed using purple perilla-eosin stains mode as shown in fig. 7, rat receive the anterior cruciate ligament place of cutting operation after, with
Control group relatively on, the phenomenon that cartilage thickness and surface layer cartilage cell are damaged can be significantly observed in the 24th week.In portion for the treatment of group
Part, tri- groups of ACLT+TCI633 and ACLT groups relatively on, it is irregular existing that the presentation of bone tissue surface can be observed
As.In ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group then can be observed a little out-of-flatness of cartilage surface, and ACLT+
TCI633(5x 10 11 CFU/ kg/days) group can be observed and normally organize more similar cartilaginous tissue.Therefore, sum total is above ties
Fruit it has been confirmed that probiotics TCI633 in ACLT patterns, in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 11 CFU/ kg/days) and ACLT
+TCI633(5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group is woven with set of bones the effect for significantly slowing damage. 
 Assess influences of the probiotics TCI633 for knee cartilage tissue 
 The results are shown in Figure 8 for it, after rat receives the operation of the anterior cruciate ligament place of cutting, is organized on relatively with normal, in the 24th
It can significantly observe that cartilaginous tissue surface fracture, cartilage cell reduce what is declined with cartilage layers dyeing signal (red) intensity week
Situation.Tri- groups of ACLT+TCI633 and ACLT groups relatively on, set of bones can be observed and be woven with slighter cartilaginous tissue
The situation that surface imperfection and cartilage layers dyeing signal strength decline. 
 On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7 and 8 results, it is known that cartilage cell's quantity in cartilaginous tissue is having use
Cartilage cell's quantity of ACLT is apparently higher than in the group of TCI633, therefore probiotics TCI633 is thin with increase/protection cartilage
The effect of born of the same parents. 
 In addition, assess probiotics using international osteoarthritis Research Society assessment score system (OARSI score)
Influences of the TCI633 for knee cartilage tissue, the results are shown in Figure 9.During scoring, while the classification using OARSI and bone
The stage that arthritis is restored carries out semi-quantitative assessment, wherein including six fractions (six histological grades) and four
A stage (four histological stages).Total score is multiplied by different phase, therefore total score range is by 1 point for different fractions
(normal articular cartilage) to 24 points (no repair) (Pritzker et al., 2006).It can by Fig. 9
Know, rat received anterior cruciate ligament resection operation after the 24th week, and compared with control group, score dramatically increases ACLT groups
Situation.In the case where the treatment group for giving probiotics TCI633 is compared with ACLT groups relatively, the situation that score is decreased significantly is assessed.
Giving ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 simultaneously 11 CFU/ kg/days) and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group
It assesses score and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 9 CFU/ kg/days) group relatively under, the situation that is decreased significantly.Therefore, always
Result above is closed it has been confirmed that probiotics TCI633 is in ACLT patterns, in ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 11 CFU/ kilograms/
My god) and ACLT+TCI633 (5x 10 10 CFU/ kg/days) group significantly slows damage to knee cartilage tissue. 
 Based on the above results, probiotic oral TCI633 Three doses (5x10 11 , 5x10 10 , 5x10 9 CFU/ kg/days),
For in the therapeutic effect of osteoarthritis, compared with ACLT groups, bearing a heavy burden to be distributed for mechanicalness hyperaphia, the rear foot changes
With have the effect significantly treated in knee joint swelling.Histology and international osteoarthritis Research Society assessment point are utilized simultaneously
Number system is analyzed, and probiotics TCI633 can effectively slow down osteoarthritis the effect that joint tissue is destroyed.
