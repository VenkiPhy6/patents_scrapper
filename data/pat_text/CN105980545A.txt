 Embodiment 
 Hereinafter, the present invention is discussed in more detail with reference to following example.These embodiments are used only for example
The property shown purpose, and it is not limiting as the scope of the present invention. 
 
 
 Embodiment 1: preparation is produced the bacterial strain of L-threonine and produces the bacterial strain of L-Trp, each has by add gene or amn
The activity weakened of the protein of gene code 
 Producing the bacterial strain of L-threonine, i.e. KCICM10910P (Korean Patent open open No:2009-0076389) and
KCCM-10132 (the open open NO:2000-0013853 of Korean Patent), and produce the bacterial strain of L-Trp, i.e. KCCM10812P
In (Korean Patent Publication text No:10-0792095), it is separately encoded the gene of Add and Amn by homologous recombination disappearance.Lack
Add and the amn gene lost comprises base sequence and the base sequence of SEQ ID NO:15 of SEQ ID NO:13 respectively. 
 In detail, use one step inactivation, its be by Datsenko KA et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.,
(2000) 97:6640-6645) the use lambda Red recombinase developed builds the technology of mutant.In order to confirm that amplification is produced
The thing insertion to gene, uses the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pUCprmfmloxC as mark (Korean Patent No:2009-
007554).Then, by using pUCprmfmloxC as template, the base sequence with both genes under the following conditions
The SEQ ID NO:1's and 2 of a part for the base sequence of a part for row and the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pUCprmfmloxC
The primer sets of primer sets and SEQ ID NO:7 and 8 implements polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter referred to as " PCR "): in 94 DEG C
Degeneration 30 seconds, anneals 30 seconds in 55 DEG C, and 30 circulations extending 1 minute in 72 DEG C, causes about 1, the genetic fragment of 200bp
Amplification. 
 The DNA fragmentation that electrophoresis is obtained by PCR amplification on 0.8% agarose gel, eluting, and it is used as two grades of PCR
Template.By using the one-level PCR primer of eluting as template and 5 ' and 3 ' districts of one-level PCR primer under the following conditions
There is 20bp complementary series and comprise the primer sets of SEQ ID NO:3 and 4 in 5 ' and 3 ' districts of gene, SEQ ID further
The primer sets of NO:9 and 10 implements two grades of PCR: in 94 DEG C of degeneration 30 seconds, anneals 30 seconds in 55 DEG C, and extends 1 minute in 72 DEG C
30 circulations, cause about 1, the amplification of 4 types of the genetic fragment of 300bp.By the DNA fragmentation that therefrom obtains at 0.8% fine jade
Electrophoresis on sepharose, eluting, and use of recombinating. 
 To develop according to Datsenko KA et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA., (2000) 97:6640-6645)
Method convert and have the escherichia coli (E.coli) of pKD46 plasmid to be prepared as competence bacterial strain, and obtain by being directed through PCR
The gene outcome of the 1,300bp obtained is implemented to convert.The LB culture medium be supplemented with chloromycetin selects the bacterial strain obtained.Thus,
About the 1 of the PCR acquisition of the primer sets according to primer sets and SEQ ID NO:11 and 12 by using SEQ ID NO:5 and 6,
The PCR primer of 440bp and 2,104bp confirms the disappearance of gene. 
 After removing pKD46 plasmid, import the primary recombination bacillus coli bacterium with chlorampenicol resistant with pJW168 plasmid
Strain, thus remove chloromycetin marker gene (Gene, (2000) 247,255-264) from bacterial strain.In the final microorganism obtained
In cell, obtain according to the PCR of the primer sets of primer sets and SEQ ID NO:11 and 12 by using SEQ ID NO:5 and 6
About 340bp and 1,004bp PCR primer confirm gene disappearance. 
 By using the disappearance bacterial strain of add gene, the primer sets of SEQ ID NO:5 and 6 and SEQ ID NO:11 and 12
Primer sets implements the disappearance of amm gene in mode same as described above, thus confirms the double deletions of both genes. 
 According to method as described above, be prepared for 6 classes and produce the bacterial strain of L-threonines, i.e. KCCM10910P Î” add bacterial strain,
KCCM10910P Î” amn bacterial strain, KCCM10910P Î” add Î” amn bacterial strain, KCCM-10132 Î” add bacterial strain, KCCM-10132 Î”
Amn bacterial strain and KCCM-10132 Î” add Î” amn bacterial strain.It addition, be prepared for 3 classes to produce the bacterial strain of L-Trp, i.e.
KCCM10812P Î” add bacterial strain, KCCM10812P Î” amn bacterial strain and KCCM10812P Î” add Î” amn bacterial strain. 
 
 
 Embodiment 2: measure the ATP level in the bacterial strain of bacterial strain and the product L-Trp producing L-threonine
