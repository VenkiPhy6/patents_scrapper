 VACCINE STRAINS OF BRACHYSPIRA HYODYSENTERIAE 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to Brachyspira hyodysenteriae strains and their use in a vaccine against diarrheal disease, in particular swine dysentery. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (B. hyodysenteriae; previously Serpula, Serpulina or Treponema hyodysenteriae) is an anaerobic intestinal spirochaete that infects a number of mammalian and avian species of animal and in some cases causes diarrheal diseases. A well-studied example is swine dysentery (SD), a significant endemic disease of pigs worldwide caused by B. hyodysenteriae infection in pigs. SD is a contagious mucohaemorrhagic diarrheal disease, characterised by extensive inflammation and necrosis of the epithelial surface of the large intestine. Economic losses due to SD result mainly from growth retardation, costs of medication and mortality. Where SD is established in a piggery, the disease spectrum can vary from being mild, transient or unapparent, to being severe and even fatal. 
 Medication strategies in individual piggeries may mask clinical signs and in some piggeries SD may go unnoticed, or may only be suspected. Whether or not obvious SD occurs, B. hyodysenteriae may persist in infected pigs, or in other reservoir hosts such as rodents, or in the environment. All these sources pose potential for transmission of B. hyodysenteriae to uninfected herds. 
 A number of methods are employed to control swine dysentery, varying from the prophylactic use of antimicrobial agents, to complete destocking of infected herds and prevention of re-entry of infected carrier pigs. All these options are expensive and, if they are to be fully effective, they require the use of sophisticated diagnostic tests to monitor progress. Currently, detection of swine dysentery in herds with sub-clinical infections, and individual healthy carrier animals, remains a major problem and is hampering 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 implementation of effective control measures. A definitive diagnosis of swine dysentery traditionally has required the isolation and identification of B. hyodysenteriae from the feces or mucosa of diseased pigs. Major problems involved include the slow growth and fastidious nutritional requirements of these anaerobic bacteria and confusion due to the presence of morphologically similar spirochaetes in the normal flora of the pig intestine. A significant improvement in the diagnosis of affected pigs was achieved with the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of the B. hyodysenteriae from feces. Unfortunately in practical applications the limit of detection of PCRs rendered it unable to detect carrier animals with subclinical infections. As a consequence of these diagnostic problems, there is a clear need to develop a simple and effective diagnostic tool capable of detecting B. hyodysenteriae infection, at least at the herd level. 
 The classical treatment of swine dysentery consists of antimicrobial agents. Since acquired antimicrobial resistance is increasing for B. hyodysenteriae, the sole use of antibiotics can result in therapeutic failure. Furthermore the use of antimicrobials is of growing public concern due to the development of antimicrobial resistance. The consumer desires safe pork produced with minimal use of antimicrobial products. 
 An immunological response is induced following colonization with B. hyodysenteriae, and pigs recovered from SD are protected from re-infection. Despite this, attempts to develop vaccines to control swine dysentery had very limited success, either because they have provided inadequate protection on a herd basis, or they have been too costly and difficult to produce to make them commercially viable. 
 Vaccines based on inactivated B. hyodysenteriae were reported to have limited success but the main disadvantage of the inactivated vaccines is that they did not provide protection against different serotypes, in contrast to what happens after recovery of an actual infection (Olson et al., 1994; Diego et al., 1995). Furthermore they are difficult and costly to produce on a large scale. 
 Several attempts have been made to develop attenuated vaccines for swine dysentery (WO9820899; W02010054437; US5882655). Most of these vaccines are based on a mutant B. hyodysenteriae strain which is defective in one or more virulence factors or hemolysin associated genes. Live attenuated vaccines have the advantage over inactivated vaccines that they mimic the natural infection more closely. As a consequence they provide in general 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 a higher level ol protection than their inactivated counterparts. However, in several cases it was shown that the use ol avirulent strains as vaccine is no guarantee lor obtaining signilicant protection against inlection (Hudson MJ. et al., 1974; Lysons R. et al., 1982). Also, clinical signs ol disease might be (partially) reduced but the degree ol inlectivity ol the vaccinated animals remains high resulting in an enhanced risk ol (re)-inlection (Hyatt et al., 1994). In addition, genetically modilied organisms require a more extensive registration procedure due to salety issues linked to the genetic mutation. 
 The use ol recombinant subunit vaccines is an alternative, since the products would be welldelined, and relatively easy to produce on a large scale. Examples ol recombinant vaccine candidates are a 38-kilodalton llagellar protein Ila BI (Gabe et al., 1995), an outer membrane protein BmpB (La et al., 2004), an smpB protein (Holden et al., 2008) and a ItnA protein (Davis et al., 2005). However, these subunit vaccines, either recombinant proteins combined with adjuvant or DNA vaccines harboring DNA lor the recombinant protein, were only reported to reduce the severity ol a B. hyodysenteriae inlection in murine models and could not signilicantly reduce the number ol inlected animals or the severity ol clinical illness in swine models. 
 The gold standard lor the control ol diseases caused by B. hyodysenteriae would be the use ol a vaccine to provide animals with immunity, preventing B. hyodysenteriae colonization and/or disease. Currently there are no effective vaccines available lor protection against B. hyodysenteriae. An efficient vaccine would be an important tool to manage swine dysentery in the luture.

By means of further guidance, term definitions are included to better appreciate the teaching of the present invention. In the following passages, different aspects of the invention are defined in more detail. Each aspect so defined may be combined with 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 any other aspect or aspects unless clearly indicated to the contrary. In particular, any feature indicated as being preferred or advantageous may be combined with any other feature or features indicated as being preferred or advantageous. Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. 
 One embodiment of the invention provides an isolated strain of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae (B. hyodysenteriae). B. hyodysenteriae are anaerobic, gram-negative, chemotrophic bacteria belonging to the class Spirochaetae and are characterized by their long, slender, helical shape. Animals infected by B. hyodysenteriae develop diarrheal diseases. Porcine animals infected by B. hyodysenteriae develop swine dysentery (SD) characterized by extensive inflammation and necrosis of the epithelial surface of the large intestine. Accordingly, while it is particularly contemplated that the strains, compositions, kits and methods of the invention are suitable for use in porcine animals (pigs and hogs), they are also applicable to other mammalian and avian species of animal, including humans, companion animals such as dogs and cats, and domestic animals such as chicken and geese, horses, cattle and sheep, or zoo mammals such as non-human primates, felids, canids and bovids. A subject as used herein includes a human or animal, in particular porcine animals such as pigs, hogs and piglets. 
 The present invention relates to a new B. hyodysenteriae strain, and its use. Surprisingly it was seen that by administering the strain to a subject a significant inhibition of colonization and inhibition of fecal shedding was achieved after challenge with a virulent B. hyodysenteriae strain, thereby substantially reducing the chance of (re)-infection. The strain of the invention is safe since no clinical symptoms of diarrhea were noted and no negative effect on growth of the vaccinated subject was observed. The strain not only stimulates active immunity (the ability of the strain to generate in a subject the development of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response) but also protects against infection (i.e. fewer successful colonizations), resulting in a protective immunity. In addition, the strain is easily 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 distinguishable, phenotypically as well as genetically, from virulent field strains of B. hyodysenteriae. 
 The strain of the present invention is an isolated live strain of B. hyodysenteriae. In a specific embodiment, the strain is an isolated, attenuated, avirulent strain. The terms virulent and virulence are used herein to describe B. hyodysenteriae strains with the ability to cause the clinical symptoms associated with diarrheal diseases. The term live is used herein to describe B. hyodysenteriae that are able to grow and reproduce. Accordingly, the live B. hyodysenteriae strain of the present invention should be able to colonize the colon of an subject but not cause the clinical symptoms (e.g. as described herein) associated with B. hyodysenteriae infection. Further, the strain of the present invention is capable of limited replication in the vaccinated subject and of inducing an immune response which is (at least partly or significantly) protective against virulent strains of B. hyodysenteriae. 
 The term strain, as used herein, describes variants of a bacterial species that can be distinguished by one or more characteristics, such as ribosomal RNA sequence variation, DNA polymorphisms, serological typing, or toxin production, from other strains within that species. In the present invention B. hyodysenteriae strains can be distinguished by their virulence status, i.e. strains are classified as virulent or avirulent. Examples of virulent B. hyodysenteriae strains include WA1, B204, Vic2, BW1, NSW5, Q.H17 and NSW15, while examples of avirulent strains include B78 T , SA2206, VSl, Al, B234, R301, B6933, and FM 88.90 (La et al., 2014). The whole genome sequence of the virulent B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1 is provided by Bellgard et al., 2009. 
 Brachyspira are capable of hemolysis, the degree of which has been used to characterize them, with B. hyodysenteriae showing strong beta hemolysis. In the present invention, the sequence of several hemolysis associated genes were compared between 10 different B. hyodysenteriae strains. The strain of the present invention is characterized in that it contains at least one, including two or three, of the genes comprising or consisting of the nucleic acid sequence given in SEQ. ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3. In a further embodiment, the strain of the invention is characterized by the presence of one or more, including two or three, further genes comprising or consisting of the nucleic acid sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 6. More particular, the strain is characterized by the presence of the hemolysis associated genes represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 
 ID NO: 3, SEQ. ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6, and optionally further comprises one or more of the gene(s) comprising or consisting of the nucleic acid sequence given in SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 9. More particular, the strain of the invention comprises the genes containing the nucleic acid sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, and SEQ ID NO: 9. Furthermore, the present invention also encompasses strains comprising one or more genes, including two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight, and preferably all genes, having a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to the nucleic acid sequence given in SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 or SEQ ID NO: 9. As used herein, the term substantially identical refers to equivalent nucleic acid sequences to those depicted in either one or all of SEQ ID NO:1 to 9 but that differ by one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions, such as allelic variants, and will also include sequences that differ due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Hence, substantially identical sequences include sequences that are at least about 90% or 95% identical, i.e. at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical, over the total length of the nucleic acid sequences represented by any one (or the combination) of the specific SEQ ID NOs as provided herein. Remarkably, the avirulent strain of the invention comprises the plasmid based virulence associated genes thereby differing from presently known avirulant strains that typically lack said plasmid based virulence associated genes. The nucleic acid sequence of the plasmid encoded virulence associated genes are substantially identical or identical to BHWA1_O2678, BHWA1_O2679, 
 BHWA1 02680 and BHWA1 02681 as characterized in reference strain WA1. 
 In a further embodiment, the isolated B. hyodysenteriae strain comprises a DNA genome (or genes) encoding one or more polypeptides (proteins) comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO:11 and SEQ ID NO:12. More in particular, the isolated B. hyodysenteriae strain comprises a DNA genome encoding one or more, including two or three, of the polypeptides selected from the group of amino acid sequences consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO:11 and SEQ ID NO:12. More particular, the strain comprises a DNA genome (or genes) encoding one or more (including all) hemolysin associated polypeptides comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 or SEQ. ID NO: 15, and optionally further comprises one or more of the or genes encoding the polypeptides comprising or consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17 or SEQ ID NO: 18. Furthermore, the present invention also encompasses strains characterized by one or more of the polypeptides, including two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight, and preferably all polypeptides, having an amino acid sequence substantially identical to the amino acid sequence given in SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16 and/or SEQ ID NO: 
 17. Substantially identical refers to a sequence having at least about 90% or 95%, i.e. at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, sequence identity with the amino acid sequence represented by any one or all of SEQ ID NOs: 10 to 17. The term sequence identity alternatively referred to as identity as used herein refers to the percentage of sequence identity between two polypeptide sequences and/or two polynucleotide sequences, for which methods of determining are known in the art (e.g. NCBI/BLAST). 
 In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to the bacterial strain deposited on 23 October 2015 with the International Depository Authority: the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-Organisms (BCCM/LMG Bacteria Collection), Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Universiteit Gent (UGent), K.L. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium, and having deposit number LMG P-29184. Specifically, said strain is genetically and/or functionally different from known strains B78 T , SA2206, VSl, Al, B234, R301, B6933, FM88.90, and other strains described in Black et al., 2015. For example, the nucleotide sequence of the gene BHWA1_RSO2195 in strain BVFl differs 41 nucleotides from that in strain B78 T  (JXNF01000009.1); the nucleotide sequence of the gene BHWA1_RSO2195 in strain BVFl differs 41 nucleotides from that in strain B6933 (JXNE01000029.1); the nucleotide sequence of the gene BHWA1_RSO2195 in strain BVFl differs 37 nucleotides from that in strain FM88.90 (JXNJ01000024.1). 
 The strain of the present invention may also be used in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular a vaccine composition. In some embodiments said composition comprises at least one of the strains of B. hyodysenteriae as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 provide a (pharmaceutical) composition or a vaccine against Brachyspira, in particular Brachyspira hyodysenteriae comprising: 
 - a strain according to the invention; and 
 - a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable relers to molecular entities and compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similarly untoward reaction, such as gastric upset and the like, when administered to the subject. More particular, the Brachyspira strains ol the present invention are used as vaccines, such as attenuated live vaccines. It is well established that live attenuated micro-organisms are highly effective vaccines; immune responses elicited by such vaccines are olten ol greater magnitude and ol longer duration than those produced by non-replicating immunogens. One explanation lor this may be that live attenuated strains establish limited inlections in the host and mimic the early stages ol natural inlection. In addition, unlike killed preparations, live vaccines are olten more potent in inducing mucosal immune responses and cellmediated responses, which may be connected with their ability to replicate in epithelial cells and antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages. However, some concerns remain over the salety ol using live-attenuated vaccines. Surprisingly, it has been demonstrated in the present invention that the vaccine strains and methods as described herein do not cause clinical symptoms ol diarrhea and does not influence growth ol the vaccinated subject, thereby significantly improving the salety ol such live vaccines. With the term vaccine is meant a biological preparation that elicits an immune response in a subject to which the vaccine has been administered. Prelerably, the immune response conlers some beneficial, or protective effect to the subject against a subsequent challenge with the inlectious agent. More prelerably, the immune response prevents the onset ol, or ameliorates at least one symptom ol a disease associated with the inlectious agent, in particular B. hyodysenteriae, or reduces the severity ol at least one symptom ol a disease associated with the inlectious agent (such as B. hyodysenteriae) upon subsequent challenge. 
 The strains olthe present invention can be administered in dosages and by techniques well known to those skilled in the medical or veterinary arts, taking into consideration such lactors as the age, sex, weight, species and condition ol the recipient subject, and the route 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 of administration. The route of administration can be via mucosal administration (e.g. oral, nasal, anal, vaginal), via a parenteral route (intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, or intraperitoneal), or percutaneous. Strains can be administered alone, or can be co-administered or sequentially administered with other treatments or therapies. Forms of administration may include suspensions, syrups or elixirs, and preparations for parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular or intravenous administration (e.g. injectable administration) such as sterile suspensions or emulsions. 
 Strains may be administered as a spray or mixed in food and/or water or delivered in admixture with a suitable carrier. The term carrier refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the strain is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or (physiological) saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. The composition may contain auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents (such as e.g. citrate buffer (pH 7.0) containing sucrose, bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.0) alone, or bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.0) containing ascorbic acid, lactose, and optionally aspartame), adjuvants, gelling or viscosity enhancing additives, preservatives, flavoring agents, colors, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired. Standard pharmaceutical texts, such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1990), 18th Edition (Mack Publishing Co.), may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations without undue experimentation. The particular pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or diluents employed are not critical to the present invention, and are conventional in the art. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder, such as lyophilised form. 
 In a further embodiment the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition or vaccine comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the strain or composition described herein. The phrase therapeutically effective amount is used herein to mean an amount sufficient to (significantly) reduce or prevent one or more clinical symptoms associated with infection, such as but not limited to mucohaemorrhagic diarrhea, inflammation of the large intestine 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 (cecum and/or colon), and weight loss; and/or to reduce the number of infected subjects and/or to reduce the degree of infection per subject. 
 The composition may be formulated for oral, parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraocular, or transdermal administration. In particular, the strain or composition as described herein will be delivered to the subject by oral administration, and 
 e.g. mixed in food and/or water. The routes of administration described are intended only as a guide since a skilled practitioner will be able to determine readily the optimum route of administration and any dosage for any particular subject and condition. 
 As is known to the skilled person, the dose or amount varies according to the route of administration. Those skilled in the art may find that the effective dose for a vaccine administered parenterally may be smaller than a similar vaccine which is administered via drinking water, and the like. The number of microorganisms that are required to be present in the formulations can be determined and optimised by the skilled person. However, in general, a subject may be administered approximately 10 6 -10 12  colony-forming units (CFUs), preferably ΙΟ 7 , ΙΟ 8 ,10 9 , IO 10  or 10 11  CFUs in a single dosage unit. 
 The compositions as disclosed in the embodiments of the invention may be part of a kit. More specific, the kit comprises a lyophilized or freeze dried vaccine strain formulation. One or more strains of B. hyodysenteriae as described herein can be cultured in appropriate medium and allowed to grow to the desired level. The pooled bacterial broth can be mixed with a stabilizer composition (e.g. trehalose, sorbitol, sucrose, foetal bovine serum, antioxidantia) in appropriate ratio and then can be subjected to a drying process. The drying can be effected by freeze dryer or spray dryer. Typically the kit would also include instructions for use. 
 The composition or vaccine of the present invention is highly suitable for protecting animals against Brachyspira infection, in particular infection with B. hyodysenteriae. The Brachyspira hyodysenteriae strains of the invention, and composition or vaccine comprising the same, are highly suitable for immunizing veterinary species, in particular pigs. In said respect, the strain or composition can e.g. be administered to early weaned pigs. The administration may take place in a single dose or in a dose repeated once or several times after a certain period. 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 
 It is thus an object of the present invention to provide the use of strains of B. hyodysenteriae of the present invention for preparing a medicament which is employed for the prophylactic treatment of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae infection in a subject, more particular in animals, even more particular in pigs. The present invention thus also encompasses the strains of B. hyodysenteriae as described herein for treating, reducing (the risk of) and/or preventing diarrhea, in particular mucohemorrhagic diarrhea, even more particular diarrhea associated with swine dysentery. The invention thus also provides a method of treating swine dysentery and a method of preventing or reducing spread of B. hyodysenteriae in a pig population. 
 The strain as described herein is easy distinguishable from virulent field strains by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The present invention also relates to a method of diagnosing or screening for avirulent B. hyodysenteriae colonization in a subject. In some embodiments the method comprises obtaining a sample from a subject suspected of having a B. hyodysenteriae infection. A sample refers to tissue, biological fluids or other materials suspected of containing B. hyodysenteriae, or its polynucleotides or its polypeptides. Examples of such tissues, fluids or materials include, but not limited to, plasma, serum, fecal material, urine, biopsy material including stomach and intestine samples. The sample might also include in vitro cell culture constituents. 
 Whether a subject is colonized with an avirulent strain of B. hyodysenteriae may be determined by assessing the presence or absence of the polynucleotides/genes or proteins as described herein, or by determining the presence of specific mutations as described herein. The presence of a gene may be determined by the analysis of any factors associated with or indicative of transcription and translation of a gene including, but not limited to RNA expression levels and protein expression levels, as well as the presence of the DNA sequence within the genome. Techniques for identifying the presence of a gene or its product in a sample are known by one skilled in the art. Routine techniques such as Northern and Western blotting, PCR, microarrays and ELISAs are known in the art. 
 In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a method of diagnosing avirulent B. hyodysenteriae colonization in a subject, comprising the steps of: (a) obtaining a sample from said subject; and (b) determining the presence or absence of one or more 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 polynucleotide sequences comprising the nucleic acid sequence(s) depicted in any one or all of SEQ. ID NOs:l to 6, or a sequence substantially identical thereto, and/or the expression of one or more corresponding mRNA or encoded protein product(s), such as depicted in SEQ ID NOs: 10 to 15, or a sequence substantially identical thereto; wherein the presence of said nucleic acids or corresponding mRNA or protein products indicates the presence of avirulent B. hyodysenteriae colonization in the subject. 
 In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of identifying a candidate vaccine strain of B. hyodysenteriae comprising the steps: (a) obtaining a sample of B. hyodysenteriae; and (b) determining the presence or absence of one or more or all of the nucleic acid molecules as depicted in SEQ ID NOs:l-6, or a sequence substantially identical thereto, and/or the expression of corresponding mRNA or protein products such as e.g. represented by SEQ ID NOs: 10-15, or a sequence substantially identical thereto, wherein the presence of said one or more nucleic acids or expression of corresponding mRNA or protein, is indicative of a vaccine strain of B. hyodysenteriae. 
 The following examples are set forth below to illustrate the methods, compositions, and results according to the disclosed subject matter. These examples are not intended to be inclusive of all aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, but rather to illustrate representative methods, compositions, and results. These examples are not intended to exclude equivalents and variations of the present invention, which are apparent to one skilled in the art.

 Materials and methods 
 1. Isolation ofBVFl and identification 
 Fresh fecal samples were collected from pigs on a farm in Flanders and cultured within 12 hours after sampling on selective plates consisting of Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) supplemented with 5 % sheep blood, 1% yeast extract, 25 pg/ml vancomycin, 400 pg/ml spectinomycin and 25 pg/ml colistin. Isolates were purified by three to five subcultures on 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 
 Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood and 1% yeast extract and eventually stored at -70°C until further use. 
 Phenotypic characterization was performed on pure 4-day old cultures and was based on beta hemolysis, indole production, hippurate hydrolysis and the presence or absence of agalactosidase and β-glucosidase. Indole production was determined using a spot-indole test (Remel BactiDrop, Dartford, UK). For the other biochemical characteristics, commercial discs were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Rosco Diatabs, Taastrup, Denmark). Type strains of B. hyodysenteriae (ATCC 27164), B. pilosicoli (ATCC 51139) and B. innocens (ATCC 29796) were included to provide positive controls for all the phenotypic characteristics that were examined. 
 Several species-specific PCRs were performed, based on the following genes: tlyA, 23S rRNA and nox. The NADH oxidase (nox) gene and 16S rRNA gene were partially sequenced by using the following primers for 16S: kag-007 forward 5'GTTTGATYCTGGCTCAGARCKAACG3' (SEQ ID NO: 18), kag-009 reverse 5'CTTCCGGTACGGMTGCCTTGTTACG3' (SEQ ID NO: 19) and following primers for nox: Br-NOXl-F 5' TAGCYTGCGGTATYGCWCTTT3' (SEQ ID NO: 20), BrNOX3-R 5'GCMTGWATAGCTTCRGCATGRT3' (SEQ ID NO: 21) (Johansson K. et al., 2004; Weissenbock H. et al., 2005). The sequences retrieved from strain BVFl were compared by BLAST analysis to known sequences of B. hyodysenteriae type- and reference strains. Strain BVFl has been deposited on 23 October 2015 with the International Depository Authority: the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-Organisms (BCCM/LMG Bacteria Collection), Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Universiteit Gent (UGent), K.L. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium and has deposit number LMG P-29184. 
 2. In vitro hemolysis assay 
 The hemolytic capacity of B. hyodysenteriae strain BVFl and 9 other B. hyodysenteriae field strains, isolated from Belgian swine herds, was compared in an in vitro hemolysis assay. Fresh blood was collected from 8 week old pigs and a volume of blood was immediately mixed with an equal volume of Alsever's solution (50/50 v/v). This blood-Alsever's mixture was washed three times with Dextrose-Glucose-Veronal (DGV) buffered solution and the hematocrit of the suspension was determined using a micro-hematocrit centrifuge and 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 reader. DGV buffered solution was added until a 10%-suspension of red blood cells was obtained. 
 Fresh cultures of the different B. hyodysenteriae isolates were prepared and incubated for 24 hours under anaerobic conditions at 37°C on a rocking platform. For each strain three cultures were made. After incubation, cultures were microscopically examined for purity and the Optical Density at 620 nm (OD620) was measured. Cultures were only retained if their OD620 measured between 0.30 and 0.35. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 500g for 20 minutes and was filter-sterilized. The strongly hemolytic strain B204 (ATCC 31212) served as a reference strain in the in vitro hemolysis assay. 
 The hemolysis assay was performed in 96-well U-bottom microtiter plates. After pipetting 100 pi of the 10% red blood cell suspension in each well, 100 μΙ of the filtered B. hyodysenteriae culture supernatant was added. Triton-X 2% served as a positive control (complete hemolysis) and DGV served as a negative control (no hemolysis). Plates were incubated for two hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After incubation the absorption of the supernatant fluid was determined using an ELISA-reader (450 nm). All assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. 
 3. Sequencing of hemolysis associated genes 
 Complete sequences of the hlyA, tlyA, tlyB, tlyC, BHWA1_RSO2885 (hemolysin activation protein), BHWA1_RSO2195 (hemolysin III) and BHWAl_RS09085 (hemolysin III channel protein) genes were determined for all B. hyodysenteriae strains that were used in the in vitro hemolysis assay. For hlyA, the ACPl-Fo and ACPl-Re primers were used as described by Barth et al., 2012 For tlyA, the primers were designed based on the sequences of tly (GenBank: X61684.1 Gl:296624) (tlyA was originally named tly as it was presumed to be the only hemolysin of Brachyspira) as deposited by Muir et al., 1992, and the whole genome sequence of B. hyodysenteriae WA1 (GenBank: NC_012225.1 GI:225618950). The tlyB and tlyC primers were based on the sequences (GenBank: X73140.1 Gl:511144) (tlyB), (GenBank: X73141.1 Gl:511146) (tlyC) and their alignment with the whole genome sequence of WA1 respectively. Primers for BHWA1_RSO2885, BHWA1_RSO2195 and BHWAl_RS09085 were designed based on their sequence as deposited in GenBank (GenBank: NC_012225.1 GI:225618950). Primers, position as given in the whole genome sequence of WA1 (GenBank:

 PCR was performed under standard conditions in a 25 μΙ reaction volume with Taq polymerase (Bioline, Taunton, USA). The PCR program started with 95 °C for 15 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, 1 minute at the primer specific annealing temperature and 72 °C for 1 minute. The final extension step was 72 °C for 2 minutes after which samples were cooled to 4 °C. Optimal annealing temperatures are given for each primer pair in table 1. For all strains, the sequences were compared to each other and to previously deposited sequences with BLAST analysis. 
 4. Comparison of pathogenicity for pigs ofB. hyodysenteriae strain BVF1 and several strongly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains 
 Three strongly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains and weakly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strain BVFl were used to inoculate pigs in five independent experimental infection trials.

 All pigs were purchased from a commercial farm, which had no history of swine dysentery. Pigs were acclimatized for at least one week and had ad libitum access to water and a commercial starter feed. In some trials a soy feed regime was applied at the time of inoculation to enhance the development of infection. During this soy feed regime each second half of the day, the commercial starter food was replaced by a pure soybean meal. Inoculations were all preceded by a 12h fast. Inoculation cultures were grown for 48 hours under anaerobic conditions on a rocking platform at 37 °C. 
 In all experiments fecal samples were collected three times a week after inoculation. DNA was extracted from the fecal samples using QJAamp Fast DNA Stool kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the extracted DNA was used to determine the presence and the quantity of B. hyodysenteriae DNA with qPCR. At the time of sampling feces were scored. Fecal scores were determined as 0: normal, 1: softer but formed, 2: unformed semi-wet, 3: runny, 3,5: 
 runny with mucus or blood, 4: runny with mucus and blood. 
 The correlation of fecal excretion and fecal scores was determined for the in the in vivo experiments with the strongly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains and for the in vivo experiments with strain BVFl. 
 5. PCRsfor the presence of plasmid genes 
 The presence or absence of plasmid encoded genes was determined for all isolates that were used in the in vivo trials. Strain B204 (ATCC 31212) was used as a positive control. PCRs were performed for three plasmid genes positioned around the plasmid's origin of replication: BHWA1_O2686, BHWA1_O2687, and BHWA1_O2688 [La et al, 2011], 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 
 Additionally, PCRs were performed for the plasmid encoded virulence associated genes BHWA1_O2678, BHWA1_O2679, BHWAl_02680 and BHWA1_O2681 as well. These virulence associated genes encode a radical S-adenosyl methionine protein, a glycosyltransferase, an NAD-dependent epimerase and an dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5 epimerase (rfbC) respectively [La et al.,2011, La et al., 2014 ]. For each of these 7 plasmid genes, three primer pairs were used, as described previously by La et al. (2011, 2014). Besides the previously described primer pairs, combinations of the three primer pairs were also used if applicable, for example the forward primer BHWAl_02680a-F in combination with the reverse primer BHWA1 02680b-R.

 6. Protective capacity of B. hyodysenteriae strain BVF1 in a swine vaccination model 
 In this vaccination experiment 21 pigs of five weeks old were purchased from a commercial farm, free of swine dysentery. Animals were randomly assigned to two groups: animals 1-12 vaccinated group, animals A-l non-vaccinated group. Animals were weighed weakly and were provided with a commercial starter feed. 
 At day -2,-1 and 0 the vaccination group was inoculated intragastricaIly with 20 ml inoculum of strain BVFl containing =10 6 * * 9  bacteria/ml. On the same days the non-vaccination group was sham inoculated intragastrically with 20 ml of sterile culture medium. At day 19, 20 and 21 all animals were inoculated intragastrically with a virulent B. hyodysenteriae strain B204. All animals received 20 ml inoculum of strain B204 containing =10 9  bacteria /ml on three consecutive days. 
 All animals were monitored daily for the presence of clinical signs. Three times a week fecal samples were collected and feces were scored. DNA was extracted from all fecal samples using QJAamp Fast DNA Stool kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the extracted DNA was used to determine the quantity of B. hyodysenteriae DNA with qPCR. Animals were euthanized 24 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 hrs alter the lirst signs ol swine dysentery. Animals that showed no signs ol dysentery were euthanized at day 40 (19 days post challenge with B. hyodysenteriae B204). 
 In order to specilicaIly determine the quantity ol B. hyodysenteriae DNA ol the vaccine strain BVFl and ol the challenge strain B204 in the leces ol vaccinated and challenged animals, primers were designed to specifically anneal with DNA ol either strain BVFl or strain B204. Specilic primers lor each strain were based on the BHWA1_RSO2885 gene (hemolysin activation protein). Primers detecting strain BVFl are HlyVacFo 5'TGGTGAAATACTGCCAAA3' (SEQ ID NO: 40) and HlyVacRe 5'TGTTGTTATATCGTCCATAC3' (SEQ ID NO: 41), primers detecting strain B204 (and all strongly hemolytic strains used in the hemolysis in vitro study) are HlylnlFo 5'GTTAATGCTGAAAAAATGATG3' (SEQ ID NO: 42) and HlylnlRe 5'AAGCTCTTGTATGGAATATAC3' (SEQ ID NO: 43). Both primer pairs were used in a separate qPCR reaction since both primer pairs generated a melt temperature ol 74.5°C and could not be distinguished based on their melt temperature. 
 For generation ol the standards, part ol the BHWA1_RSO2885 gene was amplilied (636 bp) using primers HlysSTFo 5'CAAGTTCTATGATACCTAC3' (SEQ ID NO: 44) and HlysSTRe 5'GCCGCCTTTAACATAYTCTTT3' (SEQ ID NO: 45). For each B. hyodysenteriae strain separate standards were prepared. The standard consisted ol 10-lold-dilutions starting at 10 8  PCR amplicons lor each 10 μι ol reaction mixture. Two μι ol extracted DNA template was suspended in a 10 μι reaction mixture consisting ol 0.25 μι ol both primers 3.5 μι HPLC water and 5 μί SensiMix™ SYBR No-ROX (Bioline Reagents Ltd, UK). The PCR program consisted ol denaturation lor 10 min at 95 °C, followed by amplilication cycles at 95 °C lor 30 s, annealing at 60 °C lor 30 s and extension at 73°C lor 30 s. 
 Both standards and samples were run in duplicate on a CFX96™ RT-PCR System with a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA, USA). The Bio-Rad CFX Manager (version 1.6) software was used lor calculation ol threshold cycles (Ct)-values and melting curve analysis ol amplilied DNA. The average values ol the duplicates were used lor quantilication o!6. hyodysenteriae strain BVFl or B204 DNA in the lecal samples.

 7. Validation of the protective capacity of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae strain BVF1 in a seeder model for pigs 
 Infection and disease dynamics of swine dysentery between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs were compared in a seeder model. In this seeder model, half of the pigs are inoculated with the challenge strain of B. hyodysenteriae (seeders). These seeders are accompanied by pigs (receivers) that are not inoculated and can thus contract infection in a way, similar to that on an infected farm. Sixty pigs of six weeks old were purchased from a commercial farm, free from swine dysentery. The animals were randomly divided into 6 groups, resulting in three replicates per treatment. Each group contained 5 seeder animals and 5 receiver animals.

 At days -2, -1, and 0, all pigs in vaccinated groups IV, 2V, 3V were inoculated (vaccinated) orally with 20 ml inoculum of strain BVF1 containing =10 9  bacteria/ml. On the same days all pigs in non vaccinated groups NV1, NV2, and NV3 were sham vaccinated orally with 20 ml of sterile culture medium. Three times per week fecal samples were collected and fecal consistency was scored. DNA was extracted from all fecal samples using QIAamp Fast DNA Stool kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the extracted DNA was used to determine the quantity of B. hyodysenteriae vaccine strain BVF1 DNA with qPCR. 
 At days 19, 20 and 21 all seeder animals in each group (VI, V2, V3, NV1, NV2, NV3) were inoculated orally with a virulent B. hyodysenteriae strain B204 (challenge). All seeder animals received 20 ml inoculum of strain B204 containing =10 9  bacteria /ml on three consecutive days. These animals acted as seeder animals that may spread B. hyodysenteriae to their pen mates. The pen mates that are not inoculated with the virulent challenge strain are designated as the receiver animals. 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 
 All animals were monitored daily and two times per week fecal samples were collected and fecal consistency was scored. DNA was extracted from all fecal samples using OJAamp Fast DNA Stool kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the extracted DNA was used to determine the quantity of B. hyodysenteriae strain B204 with qPCR. 
 Animals were euthanized at day 52, 53, or 54 which is 31, 32 or 33 days after challenge with the virulent B. hyodysenteriae strain B204. Animals were euthanized prior to the end of the experiment when severe anorexia, severe apathy, or fever>40°C was present. 
 Results 
 1. Species identification of strain BVF1 
 Results for the phenotypic characterization and species-specific PCR's are given in tables 3 and 4. Phenotypically strain BVFl would be identified as B. intermedia due to the weak hemolysis shown on agar plate. However, species-specific PCR's identify strain BVFl as B. hyodysenteriae. The sequence comparison of the 16S rRNA and nox gene of strain BVFl with known sequences of B. hyodysenteriae type- and reference strains, definitively identifies strain BVFl as B. hyodysenteriae: 16S rRNA and nox show 100% similarity with previously deposited strains of B. hyodysenteriae.

 2. Strain BVF1 has significantly lower in vitro hemolytic capacity 
 Figure 1 displays the in vitro hemolysis ol the described B. hyodysenteriae strains. The strength ol hemolysis showed gradual variation, nevertheless most strains showed a strength ol hemolysis in the same range as the B204 relerence strain. For strain BVFl the hemolysis was signilicantly lower than lor the B204 relerence strain (P<0.01). 
 We here provide evidence that the degree ol hemolysis also varies between B. hyodysenteriae strains. Alter experimental inoculation, animals shedding high numbers (10 8  copies/g leces) ol the weakly hemolytic strain BVFl did not show any clinical signs or lesions alter experimental inoculation. Dillerences in virulence between B. hyodysenteriae strains, not associated with hemolysis, have been demonstrated as well (Achacha et al., 1996; La et al., 2014). The absence ol a set ol plasmid encoded genes lor example can be indicative lor reduced pathogenic potential. Nevertheless, lor swine dysentery diagnosis and control, the occurrence ol low hemolytic and low virulent strains would have lar-reaching implications. Presence or absence ol B. hyodysenteriae are currently used as sole criterion lor swine dysentery diagnosis and entry control. 11 a herd tests positive lor B. hyodysenteriae, this may influence the trading possibilities ol the larm in question, even in the absence ol overt clinical signs, because ol the possible risk ol swine dysentery carrier animals. When diagnosis is primarily based on microbial culture procedures, weakly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains could be mistaken lor B. intermedia. When diagnosis is primarily based on the current PCR tests, the degree ol hemolysis ol the specilic strain cannot be estimated.

 The sequences for hlyA were similar for all strains except strain 3 bl 11 and 4cl, which differed with regard to 2 nucleotides. However, these nucleotide differences do not translate into a different amino acid sequence. Strain BVFl was the only strain with a nucleic acid substitution in the tlyA gene. The substitution was located at position 501 (GAT) as given in Tly (GenBank: X61684.1 Gl:296624) by Muir et al., 1992, or position 267228 as in the genome sequence of WA1 (GenBank: NC_012225.1 GI:225618950) (Bellgard et al., 1992). This nucleic acid substitution translated into a different amino acid at position 10 in the amino acid sequence (Glycine A Cysteine). 
 The sequence of the tlyB gene showed differences between the isolates and the number of nucleotide changes varied from 1 to 7 as given in table 5. For all strains except strain BVFl these nucleotide differences did not translate into an amino acid sequence diverging from the reference strain WA1. The sequence of the weakly hemolytic strain BVFl differed at 2 positions of which the nucleotide change at position 1416206 (CAT) translates into an amino acid substitution at position 384 in the amino acid sequence (Alanine A Threonine). With regard to the tlyC gene, all strains were identical except for weakly hemolytic strain BVFl of which the tlyC sequence differed four nucleotides. Nonetheless this altered nucleotide sequence did not encode a different amino acid sequence. 
 The BHWA1_RSO2885 ( hemolysin activation protein ) gene sequence showed no nucleotide differences for six of the strains. The strains 8dll and Ml share an identical sequence which diverges 10 nucleotides compared to the sequence of B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1. However, these nucleotide differences do not translate into a different amino acid sequence. Strain BVFl showed as much as 63 nucleotide differences compared to the sequence of B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1. These nucleotide differences result in 5 amino acid substitutions at following positions: 81 (Valine A Isoleucine), 113 (Methionine A Valine), 164 (Glutamic acid A Aspartic acid), 227 (Threonine A Serine), 264 (Valine A Isoleucine). 
 With regard to the BHWA1_RSO2195 gene (hemolysin III) it was noticed that all strains showed a difference of 14 or 15 nucleotides with the sequence of B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1 (table 5). These sequences all translated in an amino acid sequence with a difference of 5 amino acids at following positions: 51 (Proline A Serine), 56 (Valine A Isoleucine), 59 (Valine A Leucine), 82 (Leucine A Isoleucine), 93 (Valine A Isoleucine). The BHWA1_RSO2195 of B. hyodysenteriae reference strain B204 was sequenced as well and the 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 sequence was identical to that of strains lOci, 25cl and DI. This results in the same amino acid sequence with 5 differences compared to B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1. Strain BVFl showed 44 nucleotide differences compared to the sequence of B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1 (table 5), which translates into an amino acid sequence different from that of strain WA1 by 8 amino acids: 47 (Threonine -> Isoleucine), 49 (Valine -> Methionine), 56 (Valine -> Isoleucine), 79 (Valine -> Isoleucine), 82 (Leucine -> Isoleucine), 111 (Valine -> Isoleucine), 114 (Leucine -> Proline), 133 (Methionine -> Isoleucine). 
 The sequences for the hemolysin III channel protein gene BHWAl_RS09085 of the strains in this study were equal to that of B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1 or differed by 1 or 2 nucleotides (table 5), strain BVFl differed by 12 nucleotides. For strains 3blll and 4cl the nucleotide differences resulted in an amino acid substitution at position 217 (Arginine -> Isoleucine), and for strain BVFl at position 209 (Isoleucine -> Valine). 
 The low haemolytic strain BVFl showed marked sequence differences in most hemolysis associated genes when compared to all other strains in the study and to B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1. B. hyodysenteriae strain M2 is also moderately hemolytic. However, most amino acid sequences for hemolysis related genes of strain M2 are identical to the strongly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae reference strain WA1. The amino acid sequence for BHWA1_RSO2195 shows five differences compared to WA1. Nevertheless, the amino acid sequence is identical to that of most of the strains used in this study and the amino acid sequence of another B. hyodysenteriae reference strain B204. Not only a difference in amino acid sequence, which can affect the function of a protein, might influence the gradation in hemolytic capacity but there might also occur a more distant variance such as altered activity of promoter regions or altered transcription of genes under specific circumstances in vitro as well as in vivo. Although repeated subculturing can result in phenotypical changes such as loss of hemolysis (Peppier et al., 1982), already during primary isolation of strains BVFl and M2, hemolysis was always weak and moderate respectively.

 4. Fecal excretion of B. hyodysenteriae BVF1 is not correlated with clinical signs of swine dysentery 
 In all experimental trials using strongly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains, signs of dysentery were noted for animals that were excreting B. hyodysenteriae in their feces. In experiment number 1 fecal excretion was first noted after on average 11 days post inoculation and fecal excretion lasted over 25 days (end of trial). In experiment 2 fecal excretion of challenged animals was first noted after 7 days. In this trial animals were euthanized as soon as they developed clinical dysentery, hence duration of excretion was not followed over time. In experiment 3 fecal excretion was first seen 20 days post inoculation and lasted for 21 days (end of trial). 
 In experiment 4 and 5 fecal excretion of strain BVFl could first be noted after 7 or 5 days post inoculation respectively. However, no clinical signs of dysentery were noticeable. The fecal excretion of strain BVFl was limited in time and lasted for 14 days (experiment 4) or 10 days (experiment 5). 
 For the strong hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains used in experimental trial 1, 2 and 3 there is a strong correlation (p <0.001) between fecal excretion of the strain and the occurrence of clinical symptoms. This is shown in figure 2, panel A. As shown in panel B of this figure, there is no correlation between fecal excretion and clinical symptoms for strain BVFl. Fecal excretion of strain BVFl reaches similar concentrations compared to excretion of strongly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strains but fecal scores of animals inoculated with strain BVFl never exceed 1. 
 5. Plasma-encoded genes are present in strain BVFl 
 The three genes positioned around the origin of replication of the plasmid were present in all B. hyodysenteriae strains used in the different in vivo trials. Each strain was positive in PCR's using either one of the available primer pairs for each gene. The four plasmid based virulence associated genes were also present in all the different strains used for in vivo trials. Strain 8dlI gave a positive result in PCR's using either one of the three available primer pairs for each gene, strains BVFl and 49 gave a positive result using the primers: BHWAl_02678aF/BHWAl_02678a-R, BHWAl_02679a-F/BHWAl_02679a-R and BHWAl_02679bF/BHWAl_02679b-R, BHWAl_02680a-F/BHWAl_02680a-R and BHWAl_02680a29 
 WO 2017/118581 
 PCT/EP2016/082386 
 F/BHWAl_02680b-R, BHWAl_02681a-F/BHWAl_02681b-R and BHWAl_02681aF/BHWAl_02681c-R. 
 It is herewith demonstrated that strain BVFl is different from presently known avirulant strains, such as B78 T , SA2206, VS1, Al, B234, R301, B6933, and FM 88.90 (La et al., 2014) lacking all four plasmid based virulence associated genes. 
 6. Vaccinated animals show a significantly lower fecal score after challenge with a virulent B. hyodysenteriae strain. 
 In the group of non-vaccinated animals 5 of 9 animals developed swine dysentery 10 accompanied by the typical lesions on necropsy: fibronecrotic colitis with mucohaemorrhagic colonic content. In the vaccinated group 2 of 11 animals developed swine dysentery. Results are shown in table 7.

 7. Vaccination reduces transmission of swine dysentery and ameliorates fecal consistency 
 In the groups of non-vaccinated animals seeder and receiver animals showed significantly higher fecal scores (= worse fecal consistency) compared to seeder and receiver animals in the vaccinated groups. This was demonstrated by the lower probability of vaccinated animals to obtain high fecal scores compared to non-vaccinated animals (0=-1.67±0.43s.e.). Furthermore it took significantly more time for vaccinated animals to develop higher fecal scores after contact with B. hyodysenteriae challenge strain B204 (0= 0.07±0.02s.e.). 
 Figure 5 shows the cumulative average fecal scores for receiver animals in the vaccinated groups and the non-vaccinated groups. 
 In conclusion, the present invention provides a vaccine strain that is avirulent, capable of transiently colonizing pigs, and easily distinguishable from virulent field strains. It was demonstrated that after vaccination and subsequent challenge with a virulent 
 B. hyodysenteriae strain, colonization and fecal shedding of the virulent strains is reduced, and clinical signs are less severe. Moreover, the vaccine strain reduces symptoms of dysentery without negative effects on growth and feed conversion related to natural infections.
