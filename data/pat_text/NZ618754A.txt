 FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to alfalfa transgenic event KK179—2.  The invention

also provides cells, plant parts, seeds, plants, commodity ts related to the event,

and DNA molecules that are unique to the event and were created by the ion of

transgenic DNA into the genome of an alfalfa plant.  The invention further provides

methods for detecting the presence of said alfalfa event nucleotide sequences in a ,

probes and primers for use in ing nucleotide sequences that are diagnostic for the

ce of said alfalfa event.
 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is the most ated legume worldwide, with the US

being the top alfalfa er.  The methods of biotechnology have been applied to

a for improvement of agronomic traits and the quality of the product.  One such

agronomic trait is lignin content.
 
 Lignin is the second most abundant trial biopolymer and accounts for 30%

of the organic carbon.  Lignin is crucial for ural integrity of the cell wall and it

imparts stiffness and strength to the stem.  Lignin t is inversely correlated with

forage digestibility for diary cattle. A reduction in lignin may be ed in transgenic

plants by the expression of a RNA suppression construct capable of providing such

se while at the same time provide increased alfalfa digestibility. The sion of

foreign genes or suppression molecules in plants is known to be inﬂuenced by many

factors, such as the regulatory elements used, the chromosomal location of the transgene

,  the proximity of any endogenous  regulatory  elements  close  to  the  transgene

insertion site, and environmental factors such as light and temperature. For example, it

has  been  observed  that there may be  ion  in  the  overall level  of transgene

suppression or in the spatial or temporal pattern of transgene suppression between

similarly—produced events.  For this reason, it is often necessary to screen hundreds of

independent ormation events in order to ultimately identify one event useful for

commercial agricultural purposes.  Such an event, once identified as having the desired

suppression phenotype, molecular characteristics and the improved trait, may then be

used for  introgressing the improved trait  into  other genetic backgrounds using plant

breeding methods.  The resulting progeny would contain the transgenic event and would

ore have the same characteristics for that trait of the al transformant.  This

may be used to produce a number of different crop varieties that comprise the improved

trait and are suitably adapted to ic local growing conditions.
 
 It would be advantageous to be able to detect the presence of transgene/genomic

DNA of a particular plant in order to determine whether progeny of a sexual cross

contain the ene/genomic DNA of interest.  In addition, a method for detecting a

particular plant would be helpful when complying with regulations requiring the pre—

market approval and labeling of foods derived from the transgenic crop plants.
 
 The presence or absence of a suppression element may be detected by any well

known c acid detection method such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or

DNA hybridization using nucleic acid probes.  These ion methods generally focus

on frequently used genetic elements, such as promoters, terminators, marker genes, etc.
 
 As a  result,  such methods may not be useful  for discriminating between  different

transformation events, particularly those produced using the same DNA construct unless

the sequence of chromosomal DNA adjacent to the inserted DNA (“ﬂanking DNA”) is

known. An event—specific PCR assay is discussed, for example, by Taverniers et al. (J.
 
 Agric. Food Chem., 53: 3041—3052, 2005) in which an event—specific tracing system for

transgenic  maize  lines  Btll,  Btl76,  and GA21  and  for  canola  event GT73  was

demonstrated. In this study, event—specific primers and probes were designed based upon

the sequences of the genome/transgene junctions for each event.  Transgenic plant event

specific DNA detection methods have also been described in US Patent Nos. 7,632, 985;

7,566,817; 7,368,241; 7,306,909; 7,718,373; 7,189,514, 7,807,357 and 7,820,392.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The following definitions and methods are provided to better define the present

invention and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the ce of the t

invention. Unless otherwise noted, terms are to be understood according to conventional

usage by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.  Definitions of common terms in

molecular biology may also be found in Rieger et al., Glossary of Genetics: Classical

and Molecular, 5th edition, Springer—Verlag: New York, 1991; and Lewin, Genes V,

Oxford University Press: New York, 1994.
 
 The present invention provides transgenic alfalfa event KKl79—2.   The term

“event” as used herein refers to the plants, seeds, progeny, cells, plant parts thereof, and

DNA molecules produced as a result of transgenic DNA integration into a plant’s

genome at a particular on on a chromosome.  Event KKl79—2 refers to the plants,

seeds, progeny, cells, plant parts thereof, and DNA molecules ed as a result of the

insertion of transgenic DNA having a sequence provided herein as SEQ ID NO: 5 into a

particular chromosomal location in the Medicago sativa genome.   A seed sample

containing KKl79—2 has been deposited with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)

under Accession No. PTA—11833.
 
 As used herein, the term “alfalfa” means go sativa and includes all plant

varieties that can be bred with alfalfa, including wild alfalfa species.  Alfalfa is also

called medic, the name of any plant of the genus go Old World herbs with blue or

yellow ﬂowers similar to those of the related clovers.  Unlike corn or soybean, alfalfa

plants  are  autotetraploid;  thus,  each  trait is  determined by  genes  residing  on  four

chromosomes instead of two.  This complicates c research and also adds to the

difficulty of improving alfalfa. Commercial alfalfa seed is often sed of a mixture

of clones that may constitute a synthetic cultivar generated by random interpollination

among the selected clones, followed by one to three generations of ollination in

isolation.   Additionally,  a  composite  cultivar  of alfalfa may  also  be  developed by

blending see of two or more clones or interpollinating clones in isolation. When forming

a composite cultivar, equal quantities of seed from each component clone would be

d to form the initial breeder seed stock.
 
 A transgenic  “event”  is  produced  by  transformation  of  plant  cells  with

heterologous DNA, such as, a nucleic acid construct that comprises the RNA ssion

of a  gene  of st,  regeneration  of a population  of independently  transformed

enic plants resulting from the ion of the transgene cassette into the genome of

the plant, and selection of a particular plant with desirable molecular characteristics, such

as ion of the transgene into a particular genome location. A plant comprising the

event can refer to the original transformant that includes the transgene inserted into the

particular location in the plant’s genome. A plant comprising the event can also refer to

progeny of the original transformant that retain the transgene at the same particular

location in the plant’s . Such progeny may be produced by a sexual outcross

between the transformant, or its progeny, and another plant.  Such another plant may be a

transgenic plant comprising the same or a different transgene; or may be a non—transgenic

plant,  such as one from a ent variety.   Even after repeated rossing to a

recurrent parent, the event DNA from the transformed parent is present in the progeny of

the cross at the same genomic location.
 
 A DNA molecule comprising event KKl79—2 refers to a DNA molecule

sing at least a portion of the inserted transgenic DNA (provided as SEQ ID NO:

) and at least a portion of the ﬂanking genomic DNA immediately adjacent to  the

inserted DNA.  As such, a DNA molecule comprising event KKl79—2 has a nucleotide

ce representing at least a portion of the transgenic DNA insert and at least a

portion of the particular region of the genome of the plant into which the transgenic DNA

was inserted.  The arrangement of the inserted DNA in event KKl79—2 in relation to the

surrounding plant genome is specific and unique to event KKl79—2 and as such the

nucleotide sequence of such a DNA molecule is diagnostic and identifying for event

KKl79—2.  Examples of the sequence of such a DNA molecule are provided herein as

SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, and SEQ ID NO: 6.
 
 Such a DNA molecule is also an integral part of the chromosome of a plant that

comprises event KKl79—2 and may be passed on to progenies of the plant.
 
 As used herein, a “recombinant DNA molecule” is a DNA molecule comprising a

combination of DNA molecules that would not naturally occur together and is the result

of human intervention, for example, a DNA molecule that is comprised of a combination

of at least two DNA molecules heterologous to each other, and/or a DNA molecule that is

artificially synthesized and comprises a cleotide ce that deviates from the

polynucleotide sequence that would normally exist in nature, and/or a DNA molecule that

comprises a transgene artificially incorporated into a host cell’s c DNA and the

associated ﬂanking DNA of the host cell’s genome. An example of a recombinant DNA

molecule is a DNA molecule described herein resulting from the insertion of the

transgene  into  the  Medicago  sativa  genome,  which may  ultimately  result  in  the

ssion of a recombinant RNA and/or protein molecule in that organism.   The

nucleotide sequence or any fragment derived therefrom would also be considered a

inant DNA molecule if the DNA molecule can be ted from cells, or tissues,

or homogenate from a plant or seed or plant tissue; or can be produced as an amplicon

from extracted DNA or RNA from cells, or tissues, or homogenate from a plant or seed

or plant tissue, any of which is d from such materials derived from the event

KKl79—2. For that matter, the junction sequences as set forth at SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ

ID NO: 2, and nucleotide sequences derived from event KKl79—2 that also contain these

on sequences are ered to be inant DNA, whether these sequences are

t within the genome of the cells of event KKl79—2 or present in detectable amounts

in tissues, y, biological samples or commodity products derived from the event

KKl79—2.  As used herein, the term “transgene” refers to a polynucleotide molecule

artificially incorporated into a host cell’s genome.  Such transgene may be heterologous

to  the  host  cell.   The term  “transgenic  plant”  refers  to  a plant comprising  such  a

transgene. A “transgenic plant” includes a plant, plant part, a plant cell or seed whose

genome has been altered by the stable integration of recombinant DNA.  A transgenic

plant includes a plant regenerated from an originally—transformed plant cell and progeny

transgenic plants from later generations or crosses of a transformed plant. As a result of

such genomic alteration, the transgenic plant is distinctly different from the related wild

type plant.  An example of a transgenic plant is a plant described herein as comprising

event KKl79—2.
 
 As used  herein,  the  term  “heterologous”  refers  to  a  ce  which  is  not

normally present in a given host genome in the genetic context in which the sequence is

currently found.  In this respect, the sequence may be native to the host genome, but be

rearranged with respect to other genetic sequences within the host sequence.
 
 The  present  invention  provides DNA  molecules  and  their  corresponding

nucleotide  ces.    As  used  herein,  the  terms “DNA  sequence”,  “nucleotide

ce” and ucleotide sequence” refer to the sequence of nucleotides of a DNA

molecule, usually presented from the 5’ (upstream) end to the 3’ (downstream) end.  The

nomenclature used herein is that required by Title 37 of the United States Code of

l Regulations § 1.822 and set forth in the tables in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998),

Appendix 2, Tables I and 3.  The present invention is disclosed with reference to only

one strand of the two nucleotide sequence strands that are provided in transgenic event

KKl79—2.  Therefore, by implication and derivation, the complementary sequences, also

referred  to  in  the  art  as  the  complete  complement  or  the  reverse  complementary

sequences, are within the scope of the present invention and are therefore also intended to

be within the scope of the subject matter claimed.
 
 The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the complete nucleotide sequence of

the ed enic DNA and substantial segments of the Medicago sativa genomic

DNA ﬂanking either end of the inserted transgenic DNA is provided herein as SEQ ID

NO: 6. A tion of this is the inserted enic DNA provided as SEQ ID NO: 5.
 
 The nucleotide  sequence  of the genomic DNA g  the  5’  end  of the  inserted

enic DNA and a portion of the 5’ end of the inserted DNA is provided herein as

SEQ ID NO: 3. The nucleotide sequence of the genomic DNA ﬂanking the 3’ end of the

inserted transgenic DNA and a portion of the 3’ end of the inserted DNA is provided

herein as SEQ ID NO: 4.  The region spanning the location where the transgenic DNA

connects to and is linked to the genomic DNA is referred to herein as the junction. A

“junction sequence” or “junction region” refers to a DNA sequence and/or corresponding

DNA molecule that spans the inserted transgenic DNA and the nt ﬂanking genomic

DNA. Examples of a junction sequence of event 2 are provided herein as SEQ

ID NO: I and SEQ ID NO: 2.  The identification of one of these junction sequences in a

nucleotide molecule derived from a alfalfa plant or seed is conclusive that the DNA was

obtained from event KKl79—2 and is stic for the presence of DNA from event

KKl79—2. SEQ ID NO: I is a 20 bp tide sequence spanning the junction between

the genomic DNA and the 5’ end of the inserted DNA.  SEQ ID NO: 2 is a 20 bp

nucleotide sequence spanning the junction between the genomic DNA and the 3’ end of

the inserted DNA.  Any segment of DNA derived from transgenic event KKl79—2 that

includes the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: I is within the scope of the present

invention.  Any t of DNA derived from transgenic event KKl79—2 that includes

the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2 is within the scope of the t invention.
 
 In on, any polynucleotide molecule sing a sequence complementary to any

of the sequences described within this paragraph is within the scope of the present

invention.  Figure l is an illustration of the transgenic DNA insert in the genome of

alfalfa event KKl79—2, and the relative positions of SEQ ID NOs: l—6 arranged 5’to 3’.
 
 The present invention further provides exemplary DNA molecules that can be

used either as primers or probes for diagnosing the presence of DNA d from event

KKl79—2 in a sample.  Such primers or probes are specific for a target nucleic acid

sequence and as such are useful for the identification of event KKl79—2 nucleic acid

sequence by the s of the invention described herein.
 
 A " is an isolated nucleic acid to which is attached a detectable label or

reporter molecule, for example, a radioactive isotope, ligand, chemiluminescent agent, or

enzyme.  Such a probe is complementary to a strand of a target nucleic acid, in the case

of the present invention, to a strand of genomic DNA from alfalfa event KKl79—2

r from a alfalfa plant or from a sample that comprises DNA from the event.
 
 Probes  ing  to  the  t  invention  include  not  only ibonucleic  or

ribonucleic acids but also polyamides and other probe materials that bind specifically to a

target  DNA   sequence   and  the   detection   of  such  binding   can   be  used  to

diagnose/determine/confirm the presence of that target DNA sequence in a particular

sample.
 
 A "primer" is typically an isolated polynucleotide that is designed for use in

specific ing or hybridization methods to hybridize to a complementary target DNA

strand to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand, and then extended

along the target DNA strand by a polymerase, for example, a DNA polymerase. A pair of

primers may be used with template DNA, such as a sample of Medicago sativa c

DNA, in a thermal or isothermal amplification, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR),

or other nucleic acid amplification methods, to produce an amplicon, where the amplicon

produced from such reaction would have a DNA sequence corresponding to sequence of

the te DNA located between the two sites where the primers hybridized to the

template. As used herein, an “amplicon” is a piece or fragment of DNA that has been

synthesized using amplification techniques, such as the t of an ication

reaction.  In one embodiment of the invention, an amplicon diagnostic for event KKl79—

2 comprises a sequence not naturally found in the Medicago sativa genome.  Primer

pairs, as used in the t invention, are intended to refer to use of two primers binding

te strands of a double stranded nucleotide segment for the purpose of amplifying

linearly the polynucleotide segment between the positions targeted for binding by the

individual members of the primer pair, typically in a thermal or isothermal amplification

reaction or other nucleic acid amplification methods.  Exemplary DNA molecules useful

as primers are provided as SEQ ID NOs:  7—9, may be used as a first DNA molecule and

a second DNA molecule that is different from the first DNA molecule, and both

molecules are each of sufficient length of consecutive nucleotides of either SEQ ID NO:

4, SEQ ID NO: 5, or SEQ ID NO: 6 or the complements thereof to function as DNA

primers so that, when used er in an ication on with template DNA

derived from event KKl79—2, an amplicon that is specific and unique to transgenic event

KKl79—2 would be produced. The use of the term “amplicon” specifically excludes

primer—dimers that may be formed in the DNA amplification reaction.
 
 Probes and primers according to the present invention may have complete

sequence identity to the target sequence, although primers and probes differing from the

target ce that retain the ability to hybridize preferentially to target sequences may

be designed by conventional methods.  In order for a nucleic acid molecule to serve as a

primer or probe it needs only be sufficiently mentary in sequence to be able to

form  a  stable  double—stranded  structure  under  the  particular  t  and  salt

concentrations employed. Any nucleic acid hybridization or amplification method can be

used to identify the presence of transgenic DNA from event KK179—2 in a sample.
 
 Probes  and primers are generally at least about  11  nucleotides, at least about  18

nucleotides, at least about 24 nucleotides, and at least about 30 nucleotides or more in

.  Such probes and primers ize specifically to a target sequence under high

stringency hybridization conditions.

Applications, Academic Press: San Diego, 1990.  imer pairs can be derived from

a known sequence, for example, by using computer programs intended for that purpose

such as Primer (Version 0.5, © 1991, Whitehead Institute for ical Research,

Cambridge, MA).
 
 Primers and probes based on the ﬂanking DNA and insert sequences sed

herein can be used to confirm the disclosed sequences by known methods, for example,

by ning and sequencing such sequences.
 
 The nucleic acid probes and primers of the present invention hybridize under

ent conditions to a target DNA sequence.  Any nucleic acid ization or

amplification method can be used to identify the presence of DNA from a transgenic

event  in  a  sample.  Nucleic  acid  molecules  or  fragments  thereof are  capable  of

specifically hybridizing to other nucleic acid molecules under certain circumstances.  As

used herein, two nucleic acid molecules are said to be capable of specifically hybridizing

to one another if the two les are capable of forming an anti—parallel, double—

stranded nucleic acid structure. A nucleic acid molecule is said to be the “complement”

of another nucleic acid molecule if they t complete complementarity.  As used

herein, molecules are said to exhibit “complete complementarity” when every nucleotide

of one of the les is complementary to a nucleotide of the other.  Two molecules

are said to be “minimally complementary” if they can hybridize to one another with

sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed to one another under at least "low—

stringency" conditions.  Similarly, the molecules are said to be “complementary” if they

can ize to one another with sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed

to one r under "high—stringency" conditions.  Stringency conditions are described

by ok et al., 1989, and by Haymes et al., In: Nucleic Acid Hybridization, A

Practical Approach, IRL Press, Washington, DC (1985).  Departures from complete

complementarity are therefore permissible, as long as such departures do not completely

preclude the capacity of the molecules to form a double—stranded structure.  In order for a

nucleic  acid molecule  to  serve  as  a primer or probe  it need only be  sufficiently

complementary in sequence to be able to form a stable double—stranded structure under

the particular solvent and salt concentrations ed.
 
 As used , a substantially homologous sequence is a nucleic acid sequence

that will specifically hybridize to the complement of the nucleic acid sequence to which

it  is  being  compared  under  high  stringency  conditions.    Appropriate  stringency

conditions that e DNA hybridization, for example, 6.0 X sodium chloride/sodium

citrate (SSC) at about 45°C, ed by a wash of 2.0 X SSC at 50°C, are known to

those skilled in the art or can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John

Wiley & Sons, NY. (1989), 6.3.6.  For example, the salt concentration in the wash

step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2.0 X SSC at 50°C to a high

stringency of about 0.2 X SSC at 50°C.  In addition, the temperature in the wash step can

be increased from low stringency conditions at room temperature, about 22°C, to high

stringency conditions at about 65°C.  Both temperature and salt may be varied, or either

the temperature or the salt concentration may be held constant while the other variable is

changed.  In one embodiment, a nucleic acid of the t ion will specifically

ize to one or more of the nucleic acid molecules set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, and

SEQ ID NO: 2,or complements or fragments f under high stringency conditions.
 
 The hybridization of the probe to the target DNA molecule can be detected by any

number of methods known to those skilled in the art.  These can include, but are not

limited to, ﬂuorescent tags, radioactive tags, antibody based tags, and chemiluminescent

tags.
 
 Regarding the amplification of a target nucleic acid sequence (for e, by

PCR) using a particular amplification primer pair, "stringent conditions" are conditions

that permit the primer pair to ize only to the target c acid sequence to which

a primer having the corresponding ype sequence (or its complement) would bind

and preferably to produce a unique amplification t, the amplicon, in a DNA

amplification  reaction.  Examples  of DNA  amplification  s  include  PCR,

Recombinase  Polymerase  Amplification  (RPA)  (see  for  example  U.S.  Pat  No.

7,485,428), Strand cement Amplification (SDA) (see for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.

,455,166  and  5,470,723),  Transcription—Mediated  Amplification  (TMA)  (see  for

example, Guatelli et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  USA 87:1874—1878 ), Rolling

Circle Amplification (RCA) (see for example, Fire and Xu, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA

92:4641—4645 (1995); Lui, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 87—1594 (1996); Lizardi, et

al., Nature  Genetics  19:225—232 (1998), U.S. Pat.  Nos.  5,714,320 and 6,235,502)),

Helicase Dependant Amplification (HDA)  (see for example Vincent et al., EMBO

Reports 5(8): 795—800 (2004); U.S. Pat. No. 7,282,328), and Multiple Displacement

Amplification (MDA) (see for example Dean et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 99:5261—

5266 (2002)).
 
 The term  fic  for  (a  target  ce)"  indicates  that a probe  or primer

hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions only to the target sequence in a

sample comprising the target sequence.
 
 As used  herein,  the  term  “isolated”  refers  to  at  least  partially  separating  a

molecule from other molecules normally associated with it in its native or natural state.
 
 In one embodiment, the term “isolated” refers to a DNA molecule that is at least partially

separated from the nucleic acids that normally ﬂank the DNA molecule in its native or

natural state.  Thus, DNA molecules fused to regulatory or coding sequences with which

they are not normally associated, for example as the result of recombinant techniques, are

considered isolated herein. Such molecules are considered isolated even when ated

into the chromosome of a host cell or present in a nucleic acid solution with other DNA

molecules.
 
 Any number of methods well known to those skilled in the art can be used to

e and manipulate a DNA molecule, or fragment thereof, disclosed in the present

invention.  For example, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) logy can be used to

amplify a particular starting DNA molecule and/or to produce variants of the original

molecule. DNA molecules, or fragments thereof, can also be obtained by other

techniques such as by directly synthesizing the fragment by chemical means, as is

commonly practiced by using an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer.
 
 The DNA molecules and corresponding nucleotide sequences ed herein are

therefore useful for, among other things, identifying event KKl79—2, selecting plant

varieties or hybrids comprising event KKl79—2, detecting the presence of DNA derived

from event 2 in a sample, and monitoring samples for the presence and/or

absence of event KKl79—2 or plants and plant parts comprising event KKl79—2.
 
 The present ion provides plants, progeny, seeds, plant cells, plant parts such

as pollen, ovule, pod, ﬂower, root or stem tissue, and leaf.  These plants, progeny, seeds,

plant cells,  plant parts,  and commodity products  contain a detectable amount of a

polynucleotide of the t invention, such as a polynucleotide comprising at least one

of the ces provided as the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1, and the

consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2. , progeny, seeds, plant cells, plant parts

and commodity products  of the present invention may  also  contain  one  or more

additional suppression s.
 
 The present invention provides plants, progeny, seeds, plant cells, and plant part

such as pollen, ovule, pod, ﬂower, root or stem tissue, and leaf derived from a transgenic

plant comprising event KKl79—2.  A representative sample of seed comprising event

KKl79—2 has been ted according to the st Treaty for the purpose of

ng the present invention.  The tory selected for receiving the deposit is the

American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) having an address at  10801  University

ard, Manassas, Virginia USA, Zip Code 20110.   The ATCC repository has

assigned the accession No. PTA—11833 to event KKl79—2 seed.
 
 The present ion provides a microorganism comprising a DNA molecule

having a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of the consecutive

nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1, the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2.  An

e of such a microorganism is a transgenic plant cell.  Microorganisms, such as a

plant cell of the present ion, are useful in many industrial applications, including

but not limited to: (i) use as research tool for scientific inquiry or industrial research; (ii)

use in culture for producing endogenous or recombinant carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid,

enzymes or protein products or small molecules that may be used for subsequent

scientific research or as industrial products; and (iii) use with modern plant tissue culture

ques to produce transgenic plants or plant tissue cultures that may then be used for

agricultural research or production.  The production and use of microorganisms such as

transgenic plant cells utilizes modern iological techniques and human intervention

to produce a man—made, unique microorganism.  In this process, recombinant DNA is

inserted into a plant cell’s genome to create a transgenic plant cell that is separate and

unique from naturally ing plant cells.   This transgenic plant cell can then be

cultured much like bacteria and yeast cells using modern microbiology ques and

may  exist  in  an  undifferentiated,  unicellular  state.  The  new  plant  cell’s  genetic

composition and phenotype is a technical effect created by the integration of the

heterologous DNA into the genome of the cell. Another aspect of the present ion is

a method of using a microorganism of the present invention.   Methods of using

microorganisms of the present invention, such as transgenic plant cells, include (i)

methods of producing transgenic cells by integrating recombinant DNA into genome of

the  cell  and  then  using  this  cell  to  derive  additional  cells  possessing  the  same

heterologous DNA; (ii) methods of culturing cells that n recombinant DNA using

modern microbiology techniques; (iii)  methods of producing and purifying endogenous

or recombinant carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, enzymes or protein products from

cultured cells; and (iv) s of using modern plant tissue culture techniques with

transgenic plant cells to produce transgenic plants or transgenic plant tissue cultures.
 
 As used herein, “progeny” includes any plant, seed, plant cell, and/or regenerable

plant  part  sing  the  event DNA  derived  from  an  ancestor  plant  and/or  a

polynucleotide  having  at  least  one  of the  sequences  provided  as  the  consecutive

nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1 or the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2. Plants,

progeny, and seeds may heterozygous for the presence of the transgenic sequence.

y may be grown from seeds produced by a plant comprising event KKl79—2

and/or from seeds produced by a plant fertilized with pollen from a plant comprising

event KKl79—2.
 
 Progeny plants may be outcrossed, for e, bred with r plant, to

produce a varietal or a hybrid seed or plant.   The other plant may be transgenic  or

nsgenic. A varietal or hybrid seed or plant of the t invention may thus be

derived by crossing a first parent that lacks the specific and unique DNA of event

KKl79—2 with a second parent comprising event KKl79—2, resulting in a hybrid

comprising the specific and unique DNA of event KKl79—2. Each parent can be a hybrid

or an inbred/variety, so long as the cross or ng results in a plant or seed of the

present invention, such as, a seed having at least one allele comprising the ic and

unique DNA of event KKl79—2 and/or the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: I or

SEQ ID NO: 2. Back—crossing to a parental plant and out—crossing with a non—transgenic

plant are also contemplated, as is tive propagation.  Descriptions of other breeding

methods that are commonly used for different traits and crops can be found in one of

several references, for example, Fehr, in Breeding s for Cultivar Development,

Wilcox J. ed., American Society of Agronomy, Madison WI (1987).
 
 Sexually ng one plant with another plant, such as, cross—pollinating, may be

accomplished or facilitated by human intervention,  for example:  by human hands

collecting the pollen of one plant and contacting this pollen with the style or stigma of a

second plant; by human hands and/or human actions removing, destroying, or covering

the stamen or anthers of a plant (for e, by manual intervention or by application of

a chemical gametocide) so that natural self—pollination is ted and cross—pollination

would have to take place in order for fertilization to occur; by human placement of

pollinating insects in a position for “directed pollination” (for example, by placing

beehives in orchards or fields or by caging plants with pollinating insects); by human

opening or removing of parts of the ﬂower to allow for placement or t of foreign

pollen on the style or stigma; by ive placement of plants (for example, intentionally

planting plants in pollinating proximity); and/or by application of chemicals to precipitate

ﬂowering or to foster receptivity (of the stigma for ).
 
 In practicing this method, the step of sexually crossing one plant with itself, such

as, self—pollinating or selfing, may be accomplished or facilitated by human intervention,

for e: by human hands collecting the pollen of the plant and contacting this pollen

with the style or stigma of the same plant and then optionally preventing further

fertilization of the plant; by human hands and/or actions removing, destroying, or

covering the stamen or anthers of other nearby plants (for example, by detasseling or by

application of a chemical gametocide) so that natural cross—pollination is prevented and

self—pollination would have to take place in order for fertilization to occur; by human

placement of pollinating insects in a position for “directed ation” (for example, by

caging a plant alone with pollinating insects); by human manipulation of the ﬂower or its

parts  to  allow  for  self—pollination;  by  ive  placement  of plants  (for  example,

intentionally planting plants beyond pollinating proximity);  and/or by application  of

chemicals to precipitate ﬂowering or to foster receptivity (of the stigma for pollen).
 
 The present ion provides a plant part that is derived from a plant comprising

event KKl79—2.  As used herein, a “plant part” refers to any part of a plant that is

comprised of material derived from a plant comprising event KKl79—2.  Plant parts

include but are not limited to pollen, ovule, pod, ﬂower, root or stem tissue, fibers, and

leaf.  Plant parts may be viable, nonviable, regenerable, and/or non—regenerable.
 
 The present invention provides a commodity product that is derived from a plant

comprising event KKl79—2. As used herein, a “commodity product” refers to any

composition or t that is comprised of material derived from a plant, seed, plant

cell,  or plant part comprising event KKl79—2. Commodity products may be  sold  to

consumers and may be viable or nonviable.  ble commodity products include but

are not limited to ble seeds and grains; sed seeds, seed parts, and plant parts;

dehydrated plant tissue, frozen plant tissue, and processed plant tissue; seeds and plant

parts processed for animal feed for terrestrial and/or c animal consumption, oil,

meal,  ﬂour,  ﬂakes,  bran,  fiber,  and  any  other food for human  ption;  and

biomasses and fuel products.  Processed alfalfas are the largest source of forage legume

in the world. A plant comprising event 2 can thus be used to manufacture any

commodity t typically  acquired from  an  alfalfa plant. Any  such commodity

product that is derived from the plants comprising event 2 may contain at least a

detectable amount of the specific and unique DNA corresponding to event KKl79—2, and

specifically may n a detectable amount of a polynucleotide having a nucleotide

sequence  of the  consecutive  nucleotides  of SEQ  ID  NO:  1  and the  consecutive

nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2.  Any standard method of detection for polynucleotide

molecules may be used, including methods of detection disclosed herein. A commodity

product is within the scope of the t invention if there is any detectable amount of

the utive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: I or the utive tides of SEQ ID

NO: 2, in the commodity product.
 
 The plant, progeny, seed, plant cell, plant part (such as pollen, ovule, pod, ﬂower,

root or stem tissue,  and leaf), and commodity products  of the t invention are

therefore useful for, among other things, growing plants for the purpose of producing

seed and/or plant parts comprising event 2 for agricultural purposes, producing

progeny comprising event 2 for plant breeding and research purposes, use with

microbiological  techniques  for  industrial  and  research  applications,  and  sale  to

consumers.
 
 The present invention provides methods for producing plants with d lignin

and plants  comprising event KKl79—2.   Event KKl79—2 plant was produced by an

Agrobacterium mediated transformation method similar to that described in US Patent

,914,451, using an inbred alfalfa line with the construct pFGllS. Construct pFGllS

contains a plant suppression cassette for downregulation of the CCOMT enzyme in

a plant cells.  Transgenic alfalfa cells were regenerated into intact alfalfa plants and

individual  plants  were  selected  from  the  tion  of independently  transformed

transgenic plants that showed desirable molecular characteristics, such as, the integrity of

the transgene cassette, absence of the construct backbone sequence, loss of the unlinked

kanamycin resistance selection cassette.  Furthermore, inverse PCR and DNA ce

analyses were performed to determine the 5’ and 3’ insert—to—plant genome junctions, to

confirm the organization of the elements within the insert (Figure l), and to determine

the complete DNA sequence of the insert in a event KKl79—2 (SEQ ID NO: 5). In

addition, transgenic plants were screened and selected for reduced lignin under field

conditions. An alfalfa plant that contains in its genome the suppression cassette of

pFGl 18 is an aspect of the present invention.
 
 Methods for producing a plant with reduced lignin comprising transgenic event

KKl79—2 are ed.  Transgenic plants used in these methods may be heterozygous

for the transgene.  Progeny plants produced by these methods may be al or hybrid

plants; may be grown from seeds produced by a plant and/or from seed comprising event

KKl79—2 produced by a plant fertilized with pollen from a plant comprising event

KKl79—2; and may be homozygous or heterozygous for the transgene.  Progeny plants

may be uently self—pollinated to generate a true breeding line of plants, such as,

plants homozygous for the transgene, or alternatively may be outcrossed, for example,

bred with another unrelated plant, to produce a varietal or a hybrid seed or plant. As used

herein, the term “zygosity” refers to the similarity of DNA at a specific chromosomal

location (locus) in a plant. In the t invention, the DNA specifically refers to the

transgene insert along with the junction sequence (event DNA). A plant is homozygous if

the ene insert with the junction sequence is present at the same location on each

chromosome of a chromosome pair (4 alleles). A plant is considered heterozygous if the

transgene insert with the junction sequence is present on only one chromosome of a

some pair (1 allele). A ype plant is null for the event DNA.
 
 Progeny plants and seeds encompassed by these methods and produced by using

these methods are distinct from other plants, for example, because the y plants and

seeds are recombinant and as such created by human intervention; contain at least one

allele that consists of the transgenic DNA of the present invention; and/or contain a

detectable amount of a polynucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of

consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1, or consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2.
 
 A seed may be selected from an individual progeny plant, and so long as the seed

comprises SEQ ID NO: 1, or SEQ ID NO: 2, it will be Within the scope of the present

invention.
 
 The plants, progeny, seeds, plant cells, plant parts (such as , ovule, pod,

ﬂower, root or stem , and leaves), and commodity ts of the present invention

may be evaluated for DNA composition, gene expression, and/or protein expression.
 
 Such evaluation may be done by using various methods such as PCR, sequencing,

northern ng, southern analysis, western blotting, immuno—precipitation, and ELISA

or by using the methods of detection and/or the detection kits provided herein.
 
 Methods of detecting the presence of itions specific to event KKl79—2 in a

sample are provided.  One method consists of detecting the presence of DNA specific to

and derived from a cell, a tissue, a seed, a plant or plant parts comprising event KKl79—2.
 
 The method provides for a template DNA sample to be contacted with a primer pair that

is capable of producing an on from event KKl79—2 DNA upon being subjected to

ions appropriate for amplification, particularly an amplicon that comprises SEQ ID

NO: 1, and/or SEQ ID NO: 2, or the complements thereof.  The amplicon is produced

from a template DNA molecule derived from event KKl79—2, so long as the te

DNA molecule incorporates the specific and unique nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:

1, or SEQ ID NO: 2.  The amplicon may be single or double stranded DNA or RNA,

ing on the polymerase selected for use in the production of the amplicon.  The

method provides for detecting the amplicon molecule produced in any such amplification

reaction,  and  ming  within  the  sequence  of the  on  the  presence  of the

nucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1, or SEQ ID NO: 2, or the complements

thereof.  The detection of the nucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1, and/or SEQ

ID NO:  2,  or the  complements  thereof in  the  amplicon  are  determinative  and/or

stic for the presence of event KKl79—2 specific DNA and thus biological material

comprising event KKl79—2 in the sample.
 
 Another method is provided for detecting the presence of a DNA molecule

corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 4 in a sample consisting of material

derived from plant or plant tissue.  The method consists of (i) obtaining a DNA sample

from a plant, or from a group of different plants, (ii) contacting the DNA sample with a

DNA probe molecule comprising the nucleotides as set forth in either SEQ ID NO: I or

SEQ ID NO: 2, (iii) allowing the probe and the DNA sample to hybridize under stringent

hybridization conditions, and then (iv) detecting a hybridization event between the probe

and the target DNA .  Detection of the hybrid composition is diagnostic for the

presence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 4, as the case may be, in the DNA sample.

e of hybridization is alternatively diagnostic of the absence of the transgenic event

in the sample if the appropriate positive controls are run concurrently.  Alternatively,

determining that a particular plant contains either or both of the sequences corresponding

to SEQ ID NO: I or SEQ ID NO: 2, or the complements thereof, is determinative that the

plant contains at least one allele corresponding to event 2.
 
 It is thus possible to detect the presence of a nucleic acid molecule of the present

ion by any well known nucleic acid amplification and detection methods such as

polymerase chain reaction (PCR), recombinase rase amplification (RPA), or DNA

ization using nucleic acid .  An event—specific PCR assay is discussed, for

example, by Taverniers et al. (J. Agric. Food Chem., 53: 3041—3052, 2005) in which an

specific tracing system for transgenic maize lines Btll, Bt176, and GA21 and for

transgenic event RT73 is demonstrated. In this study, event—specific primers and probes

were designed based upon the ces of the genome/transgene junctions for each

event.  Transgenic plant event specific DNA detection methods have also been described

in US Patent Nos. 7,632, 985; 817; 7,368,241; 7,306,909; 7,718,373; 7,189,514,

7,807,357 and 7,820,392.
 
 DNA detection kits are provided.  One type of kit ns at least one DNA

molecule of ient length of contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO:

, or SEQ ID NO: 6 to function as a DNA primer or probe specific for detecting the

presence of DNA derived from transgenic event KK179—2 in a .   The DNA

molecule being detected with the kit comprises contiguous nucleotides of the sequence as

set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1.  Alternatively, the kit may contain at least one DNA le

of sufficient length of contiguous nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, or SEQ

ID NO: 6 to on as a DNA primer or probe specific for detecting the presence of

DNA derived from transgenic event KK179—2 in a sample.  The DNA molecule being

detected with the kit comprises contiguous nucleotides as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.
 
 An alternative kit employs a method in which the target DNA sample is contacted

with a primer pair as described above, then performing a nucleic acid amplification

reaction sufficient to produce an amplicon comprising the consecutive nucleotides of

SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 2.  Detection of the amplicon and determining the

presence of the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 2or the

complements f within the ce of the amplicon is diagnostic for the presence

of event KK179—2 specific DNA in a DNA sample.
 
 A DNA le sufficient for use as a DNA probe is ed that is useful for

determining, detecting, or for diagnosing the presence or even the absence of DNA

specific and unique to event KK179—2 DNA in a sample.  The DNA molecule contains

the consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:  1,  or the complement thereof, and the

consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 2, or the ment thereof.
 
 Nucleic acid amplification can be accomplished by any of the various nucleic

acid  amplification  methods  known  in  the  art,  including  thermal  and  isothermal

amplification  methods.  The  sequence  of  the  heterologous DNA  insert,  junction

sequences, or g sequences from event KK179—2 (with representative seed samples

comprising  event  KK179—2  deposited as ATCC  PTA—11883)  can  be  verified by

amplifying such ces from the event using primers derived from the ces

provided herein followed by standard DNA sequencing of the on or of the cloned

DNA.
 
 The amplicon produced by these methods may be ed by a plurality of

techniques.  One such method is Genetic Bit Analysis orov, et al. Nucleic Acid

Res. 22:4167—4175, 1994) where a DNA oligonucleotide is designed which overlaps both

the adjacent ﬂanking genomic DNA sequence and the inserted DNA sequence.  The

oligonucleotide  is  immobilized in wells  of a microwell plate.   Following  thermal

amplification of the region of interest (using one primer in the inserted sequence and one

in the adjacent ﬂanking genomic sequence), a single—stranded amplicon can be hybridized

to the lized oligonucleotide and serve as a template for a single base extension

reaction using a DNA polymerase and labelled ddNTPs specific for the expected next

base.  Readout may be ﬂuorescent or ELISA—based.  Detection of a ﬂuorescent or other

signal  indicates  the  ce  of  the  insert/ﬂanking  sequence  due  to  successful

ication, hybridization, and single base extension.
 
 Another method is the Pyrosequencing technique as described by Winge (Innov.
 
 Pharma. Tech. 00:18—24, 2000).  In this method an oligonucleotide is designed that

overlaps the adjacent genomic DNA and insert DNA junction.  The oligonucleotide is

ized to a single—stranded amplicon from the region of interest (one primer in the

inserted sequence and one in the ﬂanking genomic ce) and incubated in the

presence of a DNA polymerase, ATP, sulfurylase, luciferase, apyrase, adenosine 5’

phosphosulfate and rin.   ddNTPs are added individually and the incorporation

results in a light signal which is measured. A light signal indicates the presence of the

transgene insert/ﬂanking sequence due to successful amplification, hybridization, and

single or multi—base extension.
 
 Fluorescence Polarization as bed by Chen, et al., (Genome Res. 9:492—498,

1999) is a method that can be used to detect the amplicon. Using this method an

ucleotide is designed which overlaps the genomic ﬂanking and inserted DNA

junction.  The oligonucleotide is hybridized to single—stranded amplicon from the region

of interest (one primer in the inserted DNA and one in the ﬂanking genomic DNA

sequence) and incubated in the presence of a DNA polymerase and a cent—labeled

ddNTP. Single base extension results in incorporation of the ddNTP. oration can

be measured as a change in polarization using a ﬂuorometer. A change in polarization

indicates  the  presence  of the  transgene  insert/ﬂanking  sequence  due  to  successful

amplification, hybridization, and single base extension.
 
 TAQMAN® (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) may also be used to

detect and/or quantifying the presence of a DNA sequence using the instructions provided

by the manufacturer.  , a FRET oligonucleotide probe is designed which overlaps

the genomic ﬂanking and insert DNA junction.  The FRET probe and amplification

primers (one primer in the insert DNA ce and one in the ﬂanking genomic

sequence)  are  cycled  in  the  presence  of a  thermostable  rase  and  dNTPs.
 
 Hybridization of the FRET probe results in cleavage and release of the ﬂuorescent moiety

away from the quenching moiety on the FRET probe. A ﬂuorescent signal indicates the

presence of the ﬂanking/transgene insert sequence due to successful amplification and

hybridization.
 
 Molecular Beacons  have been  described for use  in  sequence detection  as

described in  Tyangi,  et al.  (Nature  Biotech.l4:303—308,  1996).   Brieﬂy,  a FRET

oligonucleotide probe is ed that overlaps the ﬂanking genomic and insert DNA

junction. The unique structure of the FRET probe s in it containing ary

structure that keeps the ﬂuorescent and quenching es in close proximity.  The

FRET probe and amplification primers (one primer in the insert DNA sequence and one

in  the  ﬂanking  genomic  sequence)  are  cycled  in  the  ce  of  a  thermostable

rase and dNTPs.  Following successful amplification, hybridization of the FRET

probe to the target sequence results in the l of the probe secondary structure and

spatial separation of the ﬂuorescent and quenching moieties resulting in the production of

a  ﬂuorescent   .   The   ﬂuorescent   signal   indicates   the  presence   of  the

ﬂanking/transgene insert sequence due to successful amplification and ization.
 
 Other described methods, such as, microﬂuidics (US Patent Publication No.

2006068398, US Patent No. 6,544,734) provide methods and devices to separate and

amplify DNA samples.   Optical dyes are used to detect and measure specific DNA

molecules  (WC/05017181).  Nanotube  devices  (WC/06024023)  that  comprise  an

electronic sensor for the detection of DNA les or nanobeads that bind specific

DNA molecules and can then be ed.
 
 DNA detection kits can be developed using the compositions disclosed herein and

the methods well known in the art of DNA detection.   The kits are useful for the

 EXAMPLES

e 1:  ion of ng Sequences Using Inverse PCR And fication of

Flanking Sequences by Sequencing

This example bes isolation of the alfalfa genomic DNA sequences ﬂanking

the transgenic DNA insert using inverse PCR for event KKl79—2, and identification of

the ﬂanking genomic sequences by sequencing.
 
 Sequences ﬂanking the T—DNA insertion in event KK179—2 were determined

using inverse PCR as described in Ochman et al., 1990 (PCR Protocols: A guide to

Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc.).  Plant genomic DNA was isolated

from both wild—type R2336 and the transgenic line from tissue grown under greenhouse

conditions.  Frozen leaf tissue was ground with a mortar and a pestle in liquid nitrogen or

by mechanical grinding, followed by DNA tion using methods known in the art.
 
 This method can be modified by one skilled in the art to extract DNA from any tissue,

including, but not limited to seed.
 
 An aliquot of DNA from each sample was ed with restriction endonucleases

selected based on restriction analysis of the enic DNA. After self—ligation of the

restriction fragments, PCR amplification was performed using primers designed from the

transgenic sequence that would amplify sequences extending away from the 5’ and 3’

ends of the enic DNA. A variety of Taq polymerases and amplification systems

may be used. Table 2 shows an example of PCR amplification for ﬂanking sequence

isolation using Phusion High Fidelity DNA rase (Cat. No. F5318 or F531L, New

England Biolabs), and lcyclers Applied Biosystems GeneAmp 9700, ABI 9800

Fast l Cycler and MJ Opticon.

PCR products were ted by agarose gel ophoresis and purified using a

QIAGEN gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The subsequent products were

sequenced directly using standard sequencing ols. Using these two methods, the 5’

ﬂanking sequence, which extends into the left border sequence of the integrated DNA

insert including the CCOMT suppression cassette, was identified and is presented as SEQ

ID NO: 3 ([C] of Figure l). The 3’ ﬂanking sequence, which extends into the right border

sequence of the integrated DNA insert including the CCOMT suppression cassette, was

identified and is presented as SEQ ID NO: 4 ([D] of Figure l).  The transgenic DNA

integrated into the R2336 genomic DNA is presented as SEQ ID NO: 5 ([E] of Figure l).
 
 The isolated ces were compared to the T—DNA ce to identify the

ﬂanking sequences and the lated T—DNA fragments.  Confirmation of the presence

of the expression cassette was achieved by PCR with primers designed based upon the

deduced ﬂanking sequence data and the known T—DNA sequence.  The R2336 wild type

sequence corresponding to the same region in which the T—DNA was integrated in the

transformed line was isolated using primers designed from the ﬂanking sequences in

KKl79—2. The ﬂanking sequences in KKl79—2 and the R2336 wild type sequence were

analyzed against le nucleotide and protein ses.  This information was used to

examine the relationship of the transgene to the plant genome and to look at the insertion

site  ity.   The ﬂanking ce and wild type sequences were used to  design

primers for TAQMAN® endpoint assays used to identify the events as described in

Example 2.
 
 Example 2: Event—Specific nt TAQMAN®

This  example  describes  an  event—specific  endpoint TAQMAN®  thermal

amplification method for identification of event KKl79—2 DNA in a sample.
 
 Examples  of conditions  useful  with  the  event  KKl79—2—specific  endpoint

TAQMAN® method are described in Table 2 and Table 3. The DNA primers used in the

endpoint assay are primers SQ20901 (SEQ ID NO: 7) and SQ23728 (SEQ ID NO: 8) and

6—FAMTM labeled oligonucleotide probe PBlOl64 (SEQ ID NO: 9).  6FAMTM is a

cent dye product of d Biosystems (Foster City, CA) attached to the DNA

probe.   For TAQMAN® MGB (Minor Groove Binding) probes, the  5’exonuclease

activity of Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the probe from the , between the

ﬂuorophore and quencher.  When hybridized to the target DNA strand, quencher and

ﬂuorophore are separated enough to produce a ﬂuorescent signal.

s SQ20901 (SEQ ID NO: 7) and SQ23728 (SEQ ID NO: 8) when used as

described with probe PBlOl64 (SEQ ID NO: 9) produce an amplicon of 81 nt that is

diagnostic for event KKl79—2 DNA. The analysis includes a positive control from alfalfa

known to contain event KKl79—2 DNA, a ve control from non—transgenic alfalfa

and a negative control that contains no template DNA.
 
 These assays are optimized for use with Applied Biosystems p PCR

System 9700, ABI 9800 Fast Thermal Cycler and MJ ch DNA Engine FTC—225.
 
 Other methods and apparatus known to those skilled in the art may be used to produce

amplicons that identify the event KKl79—2 DNA.
