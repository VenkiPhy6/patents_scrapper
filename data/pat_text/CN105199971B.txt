Sugared content is less than the wood after EC1118 strain fermentations and receives lattice grape wine；The wood prepared after the fermentation of two kinds of bacterium receives the total acid of lattice grape wine
Content and pH value are suitable, but total alcoholic strength is improved.As it can be seen that saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces
Cerevisiae) JM33 CGMCC NO.10912 are suitable for receiving lattice grape to wood and carry out fermentation and prepare grape wine.EC1118 bacterial strains
For industrial strain more common in the market, thus infer, JM33 has as the characteristic of excellent saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
 (2) results of sensory evaluation 
 A kind of low temperature resistant saccharomyces cerevisiae JM33 of the present invention and its application technology in wood receives lattice brewing grape wine, preparation obtain
Color and luster, fragrance and the flavour of the grape wine obtained all show preferable characteristic. 
 Color and luster：Straw golden, clear is glossy, deposit-free； 
 Fragrance：Fragrance soothes the spirit, the happy heart, grace, the smell of fruits is very sweet, and there is wood to receive the distinctive fruity of lattice grape, aroma of pure, nothing
Other irrelevant fragrance； 
 Flavour：Taste is coordinated, and pleasant, mouthfeel is pure, quiet and tastefully laid out, and sour and sweet palatability, entrance is mellow and full, and vinosity is big and fleshy, wine body
Plentiful, mellow soft, taste is fine and smooth, big and fleshy mellow and full. 
 
 
 Embodiment five:The evaluation of lattice grape wine received to wood using mathematical model 
 Because there are ambiguities for comment result, such as " good and bad ", " have and do not have ", " pure and impure " are without absolute
Clearly boundary is made an appraisal so fuzzy mathematics theory should be used to receive lattice grape wine quality to wood. 
 1. the foundation of mathematical model 
 If factor of evaluation collection is combined into { U 1 , U 2 ..., U n Total n factor.Evaluation approach collection is combined into V { V 1 , V 2 ..., V m , total m
A grade.Wood is received in the evaluation of lattice grape wine quality, takes { color and luster, fragrance, flavour }, V=it is excellent, it is good, in, it is poor }, wherein 86~100
Be divided into it is excellent, 85~85 points to be good, 60~80 points are poor. 
 If R be from U to fuzzy relation set, r ij (i=1,2 ... n, j=l, 2 ..., m) expression from i-th of factor
Eye receives lattice grape wine to wood and makes the possibility degree of jth kind comment.I is fixed, then (r i1 , r i2 ..., r im ) it is exactly one on V
Fuzzy set, expression are had in mind from i-th of factor, for being commented wood to receive the single factor evaluation that lattice grape wine makes, thus configured
Fuzzy evaluating matrix is R=[r ij ] m×n 。 
 Each element u in U, i.e., each assessment item included in factor, receive the influence of lattice grape wine quality quality to wood
Degree is different, there is different weights in explanation between all homoatomics, can be shown as a fuzzy subset, factor U quilts
The weight having in mind is denoted as A (u), can be referred to as in U element u to the degree of membership of A.{A(u i ) (i=1,2 ..., n) be called flexible strategy point
With set, there are A={ A (u 1 ), A (u 2 ) ..., A (u n ), wherein A (u 1 ) >=0, A (u 1 )+A(u 2 )+…A(u n )=1.According to fuzzy
Mathematical theory, the comprehensive evaluation model thus made are：B=AR=(b l , b 2 ..., b m ).Operation relation " AR " indicates A pairs
The synthesis of R, operation b 1 =V (a 1 ^V ij ), wherein " V " is logic add, indicate maximizing operation；" ^ " is logic multiply, indicates to take
Small operation. 
 2. the evaluation of grape wine 
 20 wine experts are invited to carry out sensory quality assessment to grape wine prepared by the application, assessment item includes outer
Sight, mouthfeel, acidity, pleasant impression, the small project of large project 30 of fragrance five, evaluation result are shown in Table 4. 
 Table 4：The sense organ evaluating meter of grape wine 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3 results 
 Appearance U can be obtained by the sense organ evaluating meter of grape wine l Evaluation approach fuzzy matrix be 
 
 
 
 Show the evaluation to a certain factor per column of figure in matrix, evaluation approach distinguish excellent (90-100), good (85-90),
In (80-85), poor (60-80) number proportion. 
 The flexible strategy of appearance Ul factors are assigned as：A(U 1 )=(0.3750.3750.25).To the synthetic evaluation matrix of appearance
B l For 
 
 
 
 Normalization：0.375+0.30+0.20+0.10=0.975,     
 Mouthfeel U can similarly be obtained 2 , the thick and solid U of wine body 3 , acidity U 4 , fragrance U 5 Synthetic evaluation matrix and normalization：B 2 '=
[0.364 0.364 0.182 0.09], B 3 '=[0.238 0.476 0.238 0.048], B 4 '=[0.294 0.294
0.294 0.118], B 5 '=[0.333 0.333 0.334 0] flexible strategy of factor U are assigned as (A u )=[0.08 0.10 0.08
0.24 0.50].It is to obtain the synthetic evaluation matrix of grape wine prepared by the present invention： 
 
 
 
 Normalization, there is B u '=[0.299 0.299 0.299 0.103], it is C=to take the mean vectors of evaluation approach score value
[95 87.5 82.5 70], the comprehensive evaluation value for obtaining the grape wine of the invention prepared are 
   (dividing).
 
 To each factor, such as appearance, mouthfeel, wine body are thick and solid, acidity, fragrance, can also calculate its comprehensive evaluation value.Outside
The comprehensive evaluation value of sight is W 1 =B l C T =85.375 points；Similarly, the comprehensive evaluation value of mouthfeel is W 2 =87.745 points, wine body is thick
Real comprehensive evaluation value is W 3 =87.255 points, the comprehensive evaluation value of acidity is W 4 =86.17 points, the comprehensive evaluation value of fragrance is
W 5 =88.328 points.
