 2nd, description of related art 
 Methionine is one of internal essential amino acid, and has been widely used as animal feed and food additives, with
And the composition and other raw materials of medical product of medical science aqueous solution.Before methionine is as choline (lecithin) and creatine
Body, and also serve as cysteine and taurine into raw material.Additionally, it works as sulphur donor. 
 S- Adenosyl-Methionines come from METHIONINE and are used as internal methyl donor, and many in its participation brain
Plant the synthesis of neurotransmitter.It has also been found that methionine and/or SAMe (SAM) prevention are in liver and artery
Lipid accumulation and effectively treatment depression, inflammation, liver diseases and courbature. 
 Methionine can be by chemistry or biosynthesis, for animal feed, food and medicine. 
 In chemical synthesis, METHIONINE is mainly produced by the hydrolysis of 5- (Beta-methyl mercapto ethyl)-hydantoins.So
And, the methionine of chemical synthesis has the shortcomings that only to be produced as the L-type and D- types of mixed form. 
 Biosynthesis on METHIONINE, U.S. Patent Publication number US2005/0054060A1 is described with lower section
Method：Directly utilize H 2 S or CH 3 SH, without using cysteine, is synthesized by modification for cystathionie synthase prepared by microorganism
Homocysteine or methionine.In the method, the cystathionie synthase being modified is introduced directly into cell, with according to intracellular
Methionine building-up process synthesizes methionine.However, in the presence of following practical problem, wherein because by utilizing intracellular first sulphur ammonia
The inhibitory action that the methionine of acid metabolic approach synthesis causes, the method only produces a small amount of methionine, and H 2 S or CH 3 SH
Also cytotoxicity is caused. 
 In order to solve these problems, L-methionine precursor is transformed into L- present inventors have developed by enzyme reaction
The two-step method (PCT/KR2007/003650) of methionine.The two-step method can solve H 2 S or CH 3 The cytotoxicity of SH and generation
The problem that the metabolic process of METHIONINE suppresses.Additionally, the feature of the method is optionally only to produce METHIONINE, and
Be not mixed form D-Met and METHIONINE it is highly effective. 
 In the two-step method, OSHS and O-acetylhomoserine can be used as methionine precursor.In first
During the conversion reaction of methyllanthionine, for the productivity ratio of precursor and methionine ratio, O-acetylhomoserine is better than O- ambers
Amber acyl homoserine.Specifically, 0.91 mole of methionine can be produced from 1 mole of O-acetylhomoserine, and can be rubbed from 1
Your OSHS produces only 0.67 mole of methionine.Therefore, the production cost of final product methionine
Can be reduced by the way that O-acetylhomoserine is used as into methionine precursor, and the high production rate of O-acetylhomoserine is first
The key factor that methyllanthionine is largely produced. 
 Meanwhile, the use of O-acetylhomoserine or OSHS as methionine precursor is depended on micro-
Biological type.In detail, Escherichia (Escherichia) category, enterobacteria (Enterobacteria) category, Salmonella are belonged to
Bacterium (Salmonella) belong to and bacillus (Bacillus) category microorganism, by L- homoserine O- succinyltransferases from
Homoserine and succinyl-coA production O- succinyls-homoserine (Biochemistry.1999Oct26;38(43):
14416-23), and belong to corynebacteria (Corynebacterium) category, Leptospira (Leptospira) category, unusual coccus
(Deinococcus) microorganism of category, pseudomonad (Pseudomonas) category and mycobacterium (Mycobacterium) category is led to
Cross L- homoserine O- transacetylases from homoserine and acetyl coenzyme A production O-acetylhomoserine (Journal of
Bacteriology,Mar.2002,p.1277-1286)。 
 Therefore, it is biological using in order to test the microorganism with the Escherichia of industrial purpose production recombinant protein
Synthesis O-acetylhomoserine is, it is necessary to pass through to introduce a kind of metX --- foreign gene --- expression O-acetylhomoserine transfers
Enzyme.However, in the presence of the negative attitude for introducing the microorganism for producing food for foreign gene with consumer and proving external source
The problem of the security correlation that gene is introduced. 
 Therefore, the present inventor has been made efforts, and to prepare the bacterial strain of Escherichia, the bacterial strain is produced with regard to productivity ratio
For favourable O-acetylhomoserine, without introducing foreign gene.As a result, they have found to be substituted by using by with glutamic acid
Modified polypeptide prepared by amino acid at the position 111 of the OSHS transferase from Escherichia coli, can be by
Homoserine succinyltransferase activity is transformed into homoserine acetyltransferase activity, thus completes the present invention.
