 [0001] NOVEL STRAINS OF REOVIRUSES AND METHODS OF USES THEREOF 
 CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0002]This application claims priority on U.S. provisional applications no. 60/571 ,499 filed on May 17 2004, and no. 60/574,572 filed on May 27, 2004. All documents above are herein incorporated by reference. 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 [0003]The present invention relates to novel strains of reoviruses and methods of uses thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to a reovirus strain that is hypersensitive to interferon and more dependent of the transformed status of the host cells for its replication. This strain represents a promising alternative to wild type reoviruses for application as oncolytic agents in a clinical setting. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 [0004] In the last few years, it has been realized that viruses are not only foes to fight but can become allies in our fight against diseases. One field where viruses can be used is in the treatment of cancer as "so-called" oncolytic viruses. 
 [0005] Different viruses are presently considered as putative anticancer agent via their so-called "oncolytic" potential, or ability to discriminate between transformed and normal cells, or more importantly between cancer cells and normal tissues in vivo. 

[0006] Classical mammalian Orthoreoviruses, referred to as "reoviruses", are among candidates for such an application in oncolytic therapy against cancer and some of them are presently under clinical studies. These viruses present the advantage of being naturally oncolytic, while most other viruses require the selective inactivation of viral genes in order for them to acquire an adequate therapeutic index (i.e. an ability to replicate in and destroy specifically cancer cells and not (or only to an acceptable lower extent) their normal counterparts). Mammalian reoviruses exhibit low, or are devoid of pathogenic potential in human adults an advantage in any future therapeutic use. 
 [0007] Any oncolytic virus must be able to efficiently destroy cancer cells without causing pathology by indiscriminately also destroying normal untransformed cells counterparts of the targeted cancer cells. The discrimination exhibited by any virus, or viral isolate, may depend on the nature of the alterations found in the cancer cells, the nature of the virus itself and its sensitivity to resistance mechanisms present in untransformed cells. 
 Alterations in the cancer cells 
 [0008] Only recent advances allowed a better understanding of the nature of alterations found in certain cancer cells and that are responsible for preferential reovirus replication. Details are however still lacking on the exact nature of these alterations. It is now known that the interferon-inducible dsRNA- dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a resistance factor to reoviruses in untransformed cells that is inhibited in transformed cells exhibiting an activated Ras-dependent pathway (28). Although PKR is more expressed in the presence of interferon, uninduced (in the absence of interferon) untransformed cells nevertheless display significant basal PKR activity. High levels of biological active PKR is found in normal untransformed cells, such as "flat" mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts exhibiting highly developed contact inhibition of the 

cellular monolayer in cultured cells. PKR inhibits the multiplication of certain reovirus and this inhibition is generally believed to occur via an increased phosphorylation level of the cellular elF-2 translation initiation factor. 
 [0009] The resistance to reovirus multiplication observed in untransformed NIH-3T3 mouse fibrobiasts is apparently due to such a high level of active PKR. Ras transformation of these cells interferes with PKR activity and allows reovirus multiplication and cell lysis, thus producing a potentially "oncolytic" virus. This oncolytic potential allows the virus to selectively destroy tumoral cells in vivo (1 ,5,11 ,12,20,31) and generated much interest in view of their eventual clinical application in humans. 
 [0010] In addition to the discrimination between untransformed and Ras- transformed cells due to PKR activity/inhibition, it has been suggested that differences in early events of the viral replication cycle, namely the removal of the outer viral capsid by cell lysosomal proteases known as cathepsins, could affect the discrimination (10). This is based on the observation that this step in the viral multiplication cycle, referred to as uncoating, is often a limiting step that determines the ability of a given cell type to be infected by reovirus (10,29) 
 Nature of the virus itself 
 [0011] Many viruses have developed mechanisms to counteract PKR, and the existence of these mechanisms underlines the importance of this resistance factor in viral multiplication. In reoviruses, PKR inhibition was shown to rely mostly on the synthesis of the σ3 viral protein that competes with PKR for the dsRNA activator (3,4,15,17,18,24,33). However, the resistance conferred by the protein is certainly incomplete since reoviruses are not protected against high levels of PKR activity. 

[0012] In addition, the σ3 protein forms a heterohexameric structure with the μ1 protein to make the outer capsid of the virion. Binding of σ3 to dsRNA and μ1 appears mutually exclusive (4,13,19,24); the crystallographic structure suggests that the two binding domains largely overlap (16,21) explaining this observation. Interferon and PKR sensitivity of a given virus isolate could thus depend on the relative affinity of σ3 to bind either double-stranded RNA or μ1 , and could also varies depending on the amount and nature of μ1 (4,24). 
 [0013] There remains a need for approaches to further optimizes reovirus oncolytic activity towards specific target cancer cells. 
 [0014] There remains a need for additional viral isolates that could be used in addition to wild type reovirus. 
 [0015] There remains a need for improved reoviruses and for an easy non toxic approach to eliminate the virus post-treatment. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 [0016] The present invention concerns the novel finding that an increased interferon sensitivity of viruses correlates with their increased ability to discriminate between normal and Ras-transformed cells (23). 
 [0017] The present invention concerns isolates of mammalian reovirus 
 (family Reoviridae, genus Orthoreovirus, serotype 3 Dearing, or MRV-3) strains obtained by chemical mutagenesis and biological cloning. These isolates differ in their interferon sensitivity. They are referred to as P4L-12, P4SC1-31 and P4SC1-42 (23). 

[0018] In a specific embodiment, the present invention concerns a reovirus strain having a high sensitivity to interferon, the P4L-12 virus strain, which constitutes an attractive candidate for cancer treatment and for easy elimination by interferon post treatment (23). 
 [0019] The present application is the first to present a reovirus isolate having better ability than wild-type reovirus to discriminate between parental and Ras-transformed cells. 
 [0020] The present application is the first to present a reovirus isolate with apparently better replicative ability in Ras-transformed cells than wild-type reoviruses. 
 [0021] The P4L-12 virus could be easier to eliminate from inoculated individual using interferon treatment, an additional safety measure. 
 [0022] As used herein, the terminology "transformed cells" and "cells expressing an activated Ras pathway", refers to cells expressing characteristics traditionally associated with tumor cells via expression of oncogenic Ras or any other indirect activation of the Ras pathway leading to cellular transformation. 
 [0023] As used herein the terminologies "untransformed cells", "normal cells" and "parental cells" refer to cells that do not express an activated Ras pathway nor characteristics traditionally associated with tumor cells. 
 [0024] As used herein the terminologies "isolate" and "strain" are used interchangeably to refer to biologically-cloned viruses obtained by any known method including but not limited to consecutive limiting dilution and plaque 

purification . 
 Mutations, mutants and variants 
 [0025] As commonly known, a "mutation" is a change in the genetic material of a biological entity which can be transmitted to its descendent. As is well known, a mutation can be, for example, a change in one or more nucleotides. For example, nucleotides can be added, deleted or substituted for another nucleotide. Spontaneous mutations and experimentally induced mutations exist. A mutant polypeptide can be encoded from this mutant nucleic acid molecule. 
 [0026] As used herein, a "mutant" of the novel strains of reoviruses of the present invention namely the P4L-12 isolate deposited in the International Depository Authority of Health Canada in Winnipeg under access no: IDAC 059 on May 20, 2004; the P4SC1-31 isolate, and the P4SC1-42 isolate may or may not have the same identifying biological characteristics of these isolates, as long as the mutant possesses the desirable oncolytic abilities of their parent strains. Illustrative examples of suitable methods for preparing mutants and variants of the inventive strain include, but are not limited to: mutagenesis by irradiation with ultraviolet light or X-rays, or by treatment with a chemical mutagen such as nitrosoguanidine (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- nitrosoguanidine), methylmethanesulfonate, nitrogen mustard and the like. These methods are well known in the art and are described, for example in the case of reoviruses (9,14,22). Hence mutants of reoviruses encompassed within the present invention may comprise a mutation at position 221 of σ3 according to the numbering presented in SEQ ID NO: 1 and at position 315 of μl according to the numbering presented in SEQ ID NO: 4. They may further comprise mutations in σ3 responsible for resistance to E-64 which further 

enhance their ability to discriminate. 
 [0027] Mutated strains derived from the P4L-12 strain using known methods are then preferably selected or screened for improved ability to discriminate between Ras transformed cells and their untransformed counterparts, for their improved virulence towards cancer cells, or for other desirable properties related to their oncolytic potential towards mammal cancer cells and more particularly human cancer cells. In a specific embodiment of the mutagenesis and screening approach to strain improvement of the present invention, mutagenized viruses are selected on the basis of their improved ability to discriminate between transformed cells and their untransformed counterparts, their improved virulence towards cancer cells and/or their larger spectrum of action on various cancer cells.

[0032] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for lysing mammalian cells expressing an activated Ras pathway in vivo comprising applying a cytotoxic amount of an isolate of the present invention to a mammal suspected of having cells expressing an 

activated Ras pathway. In a specific embodiment, the method further comprises a step of eliminating residual isolate from said mammal comprising administration of interferon to said mammal. In an other specific embodiment, the mammal is a human. In an other specific embodiment, the isolate is P4L- 12. 
 [0033] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of identifying an isolate of a mammalian reovirus mutant having an increased ability to discriminate between cells expressing an activated Ras pathway and their normal counterparts comprising comparing the sensitivity to interferon of a candidate reovirus isolate to that of a wild-type reovirus isolate, wherein the candidate reovirus isolate is selected if it is more sensitive to interferon than the wild-type reovirus isolate. In a specific embodiment, the step of comparing the sensitivity to interferon of a candidate reovirus isolate to that of a wild-type reovirus isolate is performed in L929 cells. [0034] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of identifying an isolate of a mammalian reovirus mutant having an increased ability to discriminate between cells expressing an activated Ras pathway and their normal counterparts comprising identifying a reovirus which hybridizes to at least one hybridization probe selected from the group consisting of a first probe, the nucleotide sequence of which consists of SEQ ID NO: 7 and a second probe, the nucleotide sequence of which consists of SEQ ID NO: 8. 
 [0035] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of selecting a reovirus strain for treating a tumor in a patient in need thereof comprising determining whether said tumor comprises cells expressing an activated Ras pathway wherein if said tumor comprises cells expressing an activated Ras pathway, a treatment comprising the administration of a reovirus of the present invention is selected. 

[0036] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a use of a reovirus isolate of the present invention for lysing cells expressing an activated Ras pathway. 
 [0037] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a use of a reovirus isolate of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for lysing cells expressing an activated Ras pathway. 
 [0038] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for lysing mammalian cancer cells comprising applying a cytotoxic amount of an isolate according to the present invention on mammalian cancer cells. In a more specific embodiment of this method, the isolate is P4L-12 and the mammalian cancer cells expresses Ras. In an other more specific embodiment, the method further comprises a step of eliminating residual P4L-12 isolate from the treated individual or animal comprising administration of interferon following treatment or during treatment. [0039] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of identifying an isolate of a mammalian reovirus mutant having an increased ability to discriminate between cancer cells and their normal counterparts comprising comparing the sensitivity to interferon of a candidate reovirus isolate to that of a wild-type reovirus isolate, wherein the candidate reovirus isolate is selected if it is more sensitive to interferon than the wild-type reovirus isolate. 
 [0040] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of identifying an isolate of a mammalian reovirus mutant that preferentially replicates in Ras-transformed cells comprising comparing the sensitivity to interferon of a candidate reovirus isolate to that of a wild-type reovirus isolate, wherein the candidate reovirus isolate is selected if it is more sensitive to interferon than the wild-type reovirus isolate. 
 [0041] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is 

provided a method of identifying a factor influencing the ability of a reovirus isolate to discriminate between normal and Ras-transformed cells comprising identifying genetic alterations in the nucleotide sequence or alteration in the protein expression of a candidate reovirus isolate having a sensitivity to interferon that differs from that of wild-type reovirus isolate by comparing the nucleotide sequence or the protein expression of the candidate reovirus isolate with that of wild-type reovirus isolate. 
 [0042] Since the approaches for manipulation of the reovirus by "reverse genetics" are still under development, classical genetic approaches are the only tools available to modify the viral genome. The present invention therefore also relates to the use of the reovirus isolates of the present invention for determining the nature of the genetic alterations responsible for reovirus sensitivity to interferon and preferential ability to multiply in Ras-transformed cells and its increased virulence as compared to wild-type reoviruses towards these cells. The present invention is especially concerned with the use of P4L- 12 strain for this purpose. 
 [0043] The present invention relates to methods of optimizing reovirus sensitivity to interferon and discrimination between normal and cancer cells by combining different mutations in σ3 encoding and μ1 encoding genes. 
 [0044] In particular, the present invention concerns combining mutations that affect virus uncoating with those mutations in P4L-12 that affect the discrimination between parental and Ras-transformed cells based on the different sensitivity to interferon. The recombinant reovirus could be generated by co-infection of mammalian cells with different subtypes of reoviruses or by screening mutants resistant to E64 from P4L-12. 
 [0045] The present invention also concerns the use of the different viral 

isolates described herein, especially the interferon hypersensitive P4L-12 virus strain to determine their replicative potential in different transformed cells, especially of human origin. Although P4L-12 appears to be the most interesting virus for future clinical applications, it cannot be excluded that viruses with intermediate sensitivity could be appropriate in specific cancer cell types. The present invention therefore also concerns the use of the intermediate sensitivity novel viral isolates to determine their potency in various animals tumor cells, especially urine, models of tumors produced by inoculation of murine or human tumor cells. 
 [0046] As used herein, the term "reovirus" refers to any mammalian or avian reovirus classified in the Orthoreovirus genus, whether naturally occurring, modified or recombinant. In more specific embodiments, mammalian reoviruses are used. 
 [0047] As used herein a "mammal suspected of having a proliferative disorder" is meant to refer to a mammal that may have a proliferative disorder or tumor or has been diagnosed with a proliferative disorder or tumor or has been previously diagnosed with a proliferative disorder or tumor, the tumor or substantially all of the tumor has been surgically removed and the mammal is suspected of harboring some residual tumor cells. 
 [0048] As used herein the term "hypersensitivity to interferon" is defined as a sensitivity to interferon that is higher than that of wild-type H8-2 and than that of original stock of reovirus serotype 3 Dearing obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. 
 [0049] As used herein the term "improved ability to discriminate between Ras transformed cells and their untransformed counterparts" is defined as an 

ability to discriminate such cells that is higher than that of H8-2 or than that of original stock of reovirus serotype 3 Dearing obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC VR824). 
 Pharmaceutical compositions [0050] This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the reoviruses associated with a "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient". In making the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient reovirus is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders. 
 [0051] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy- benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed 

release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art. 
 [0052] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention preferably contain about 10 2  pfus to about 10 13  pfus of the reovirus. The predetermined quantity of reovirus is calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. 
 [0053] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intracranially intranasally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, sublingually, intrathecally, or intradermally. The route of administration can depend on a variety of factors, such as the environment and therapeutic goals. As used herein, mammals generally refer to humans, but also can include domesticated mammals (e.g., dogs, cats, and livestock such as cows, horses, pigs, and sheep) in which prevention, delay or treatment of proliferative diseases such as cancer is desirable. 
 [0054] Of course the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered in conjunction with removal of the tumor. It may also be administered in combination with any other known anticancer therapy including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, interferon treatment, interleukin treatment or any other immunotherapeutic approach. 
 [0055] The term "high stringency conditions" are meant to refer to conditions enabling only sequences with a high homology to bind. Without being so limited, examples of such conditions are listed In the handbook "Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual, second edition of 1989 from Sambrook et al.: 6XSSC or 6XSSPE, Denhardt's reagent or not, 0.5% SDS and the temperature used for obtaining high stringency conditions is most often in 

around 68°C (see pages 9.47 to 9.57 of Sambrook and particularly pages 9.56 and 9.57) oligonucleotides. Although the optimal temperature to be used for a specific nucleic acid probe may be empirically calculated, and although there is room for alternatives in the buffer conditions selected, within these very well known condition ranges, the nucleic acid captured will not vary significantly. Indeed, Sambrook clearly indicates that the "choice depends to a large extent on personal preference" (see page 9.47). Sambrook specifies that the formula to calculate the optimal temperature which varies according to the fraction of guanine and cytosine in the nucleic acid probe and the length of the probe (10 to 20°C lower than T m  wherein T m  = 81.5°C + 16.6(logι 0 [Na + ]) + 0.41 (fraction G+C)-0.63 (% formamide -(600/I)) (see pages 9.50 and 9.51 of Sambrook). 
 [0056] Other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading of the following non- restrictive description of preferred embodiments thereof, given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. 
 [0057] The present invention seeks to meet these needs and other needs.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS 
 [0067]According to the present invention, MRV-3 (mammalian reovirus serotype 3, strain Dearing, genus Orthoreovirus, family Reoviridae) isolates differing in interferon sensitivity were obtained and their ability to replicate and destroy parental or Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells were tested. 
 [0068]According to the present invention, reovirus isolates differing in their interferon sensitivity are presented that were obtained by chemical mutagenesis. Their replicative properties in parental and Ras-transformed mouse NIH-3T3 cells are also presented. It was observed that most isolates can bypass resistance mechanisms of parental cells at high multiplicity of infection and that there is at least a partial correlation between the ability to discriminate between transformed and parental cells and this isolates' interferon sensitivity. Most interestingly, an interferon-hypersensitive mutant virus was more dependent on Ras activation than any other viral isolate. Altogether, this suggests that optimal viral isolates could be selected to attack tumoral cells depending on these cells' level of PKR expression and/or activation as well as that of upstream or downstream factors affecting the ability of PKR to influence reovirus' replication. 
 [0069] According to the present invention, it was observed that primary human peripheral blood monocytes are completely resistant to the P4L-12 isolate while some viral multiplication was observed at high multiplicity of infection for the control wild type isolate H8-2. 

[0070] According to the present invention, it was observed that the P4L- 
 12 isolate is not more resistant than a wild type virus to the effect of an inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsins, indicating that the strict dependence of this virus to an activated Ras pathway could not be due to the virus' better ability to be uncoated. 
 [0071] According to the present invention, two unique amino acids substitutions were found in the S4 and M2 gene of the P4L-12 virus isolate, encoding respectively the σ3 and μ1 viral outer capsid proteins. 
 Cells [0072] Mouse fibrobiasts L929 cells were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were propagated in MEM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. SC1 feral mouse embryo fibrobiasts cells were also obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and propagated in MEM medium supplemented with 1% non- essential amino acids and 5% fetal bovine serum. Parental NIH-3T3 murine fibrobiasts cells and their Harvey-Ras G72,  -transformed counterparts (herein referred to as Ras-transformed) were a generous gift from Dr. Robert Nabi (Departement de Pathologie et biologie cellulaire, Universite de Montreal). These cells were originally obtained from Dr Michael Lisanti (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) and were routinely propagated in DMEM medium supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, vitamins and 10% Calf serum. They were passaged on a regular basis at a cell density of 300 000 cells per 10cm-diameter culture dish to avoid spontaneous transformation. 
 Viruses [0073] Original stock of reovirus serotype 3 (Dearing) was originally obtained 

from the American type culture collection (ATCC). The PI3-1 virus exhibiting a Y354H amino acid substitution in the σ3 protein was obtained from Dr Terence S. Dermody (Vanderbilt University) and was described as exhibiting an increased kinetic of disassembly of its outer capsid protein and resistance to lysosomal proteases inhibitors such as E-64 (2,8,30). All virus stocks were propagated at a multiplicity of infection of one plaque forming unit (PFU)/cell in mouse L929 cells. 
 EXAMPLE 1 Generation of viral isolates [0074] Chemical mutagenesis was used to obtain a panel of viral isolates that differ in their sensitivity to interferon. It was reasoned that these viruses should also differ in their sensitivity to PKR, and therefore in their ability to discriminate between normal and transformed (or cancerous) cells. The classical reovirus serotype 3 Dearing was chosen for mutagenic treatment. 
 [0075] The Dearing strain of mammalian reovirus serotype 3 (MRV-3) was exposed to 0, 5, 20, 50 or 200 μg/ml of Nitrosoguanidine (NTG) (Sigma- Aldrich, Oakville, ON) and then titrated over a 9 days period on L929 cells seeded in 96-wells microplate using the TCID 50  method. 
 [0076] Recovery of infectious virus following treatment at different concentrations of the mutagen was quantitated, as summarized in Table 1 below. Concentration of 200 μg/ml, resulting in less than 0.002% of virus survival, was used thereafter to maximize the chances of obtaining mutants while ensuring recovery of infectious viruses. Viruses treated with 200μg/ml were then passaged 4 times on either L929 cells or SC1 cells. These pools were then used to isolate viral clones.

 EXAMPLE 2 Isolation of viral cloned isolates [0077] All viral isolates were cloned using two consecutive cloning steps. First, viral stocks were diluted and plated in 96-wells microplates seeded with L929 cells such as to obtain less than 50% of visibly infected wells after 7 days. Viruses were then propagated on L929 cells monolayers and recloned by plaque formation on L929 cells monolayers overlaid with agar. Isolated plaques were picked and virus propagated again in L929 cells. Final viral stocks were titered using the TCID 50  method on L929 cells (7). 
 [0078] Three isolates were tested since they differed in their sensitivity to interferon in the classical L929 cells model and in their replicative ability in parental vs Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells. These virus isolates will be referred to as P4L-12, P4SC1-31 and P4SC1-42. H8-2 was used as a plaque-purified cloned viral isolate of classical wild type reovirus serotype 3 Dearing and was the control wild-type strain. The three P4 viruses were recovered following four passages of the mutated virus stock, in L929 cells (P4L-12) or SC1 cells (P4SC1-31 and P4SC1-42). 

 EXAMPLE 3 Viral isolates' sensitivity to interferon measured with viral protein synthesis 
 [0079] In initial comparison of interferon sensitivity between different viral isolates, L929 cells (5 X 10 5  cells seeded in a 60 mm diameter petri dish) were pretreated with a saturating concentration of 500 international units (IU)/ml of mouse β-interferon (Calbiochem, La Jolla CA) for 24 hours before being infected at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell. Infected cells were incubated in MEM containing 2% heat-decomplemented fetal bovine serum and interferon concentration was maintained at the same level. 
 [0080] Medium was replaced with methionine and serum-free medium with 25μCi/ml of Tran 35 S-Label (Perkin Elmer Boston MA, 7Ci/mmol or 259MBQ/mmol) and incubated for 2 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS, scraped from the petri dish and recovered by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (1000 rpm for 2 minutes in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge). Cells were then lyzed in TBS/1% NP40. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (10 000 rpm for 20 minutes) and supernatant recovered for analysis by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide-bis-acrylamide gel) and autoradiography on a Kodak X-omat™ AR film (Amersham, Piscataway NJ). 
 [0081] Sixteen different cloned viral isolates that were examined generated a panel of viruses exhibiting varying degree of sensitivity to interferon in L929 cells, measured by their viral proteins synthesis. 
 [0082] The four isolates (H8-2, P4L-12, P4SC1-31 , P4SC1-42) represented the overall variation in sensitivity observed and were more extensively examined by varying the concentration of interferon at 25, 50 or 
 250 lU/ml. Among these four strains, two appeared only moderately sensitive to 

interferon: H8-2, the cloned isolate of wild-type virus, and P4SC1-42. There was still a significant level of viral proteins synthesized even at 250 lU/ml of interferon with these 2 viruses. In contrast, the other two viral isolates (P4L-12 and P4SC1-31) were notably more sensitive to interferon with an important decrease in synthesis of viral proteins even at low (25 lU/ml) concentrations of interferon. (Data not shown) 
 EXAMPLE 4 Viral isolates' sensitivity to interferon measured by viral titration 
 [0083] Sensitivity to interferon was further examined by quantitation of the decrease in virus titer in interferon-treated L929 compared to that in non treated cells as graphically illustrated in Figure 1. Viral stocks prepared from infected L929 cells were titered by TCID5 0  on L929 cells, as described in Example 3. Treatment with interferon at 500IU/ml was performed 24 hours before titration in 96-wells microplate. Results are presented as the average of three independent experiments with errors bars representing standard deviation of the mean. 
 [0084] As expected, at most a tenfold decrease was observed with wild type virus (H8-2); isolate P4SC1-42 had a similar sensitivity, as previously observed when protein synthesis was examined in Example 3, these two isolates could be considered to have only low, although significant, sensitivity to interferon. The P4SC1-31 virus exhibited an increased sensitivity of up to 40-fold decrease in virus titer. The P4L-12 isolate is a most interesting virus with a more than 1000-fold decrease in virus titer upon interferon treatment, making it the most interferon-sensitive reovirus isolate in this cell system, one that could likely be referred to as a "hypersensitive" virus exhibiting high sensitivity to interferon. 

 EXAMPLE 5 Infection of Ras-transformed cells by the viral isolates measured by viral protein synthesis 
 [0085] Parental and Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 X 10 5  cells per 100 mm diameter petri dish. The four viral isolates were propagated, titered on L929 cells and used to infect parental or 
 Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells at increasing MOI for 48 hours at 37°C. 
 Infected cells were incubated in MEM containing 2% heat-decomplemented fetal bovine serum. 
 [0086] The efficiency of infection and replication in the two cell types was measured by determining the synthesis of viral proteins by immunoblotting. 
 [0087] Proteins were recovered 48 hours post-infection by cell lysis in 
 TBS-NP40 and analysis was achieved by using a rabbit antireovirus ahtiserum followed by a phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (1/3000 Cedarianes Hornby ON). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using NBT-BCIP substrate (InVitrogen life technologies, Burlington ON). 
 [0088] With increasing MOI, the different viral isolates were gradually able to bypass the restriction to synthesis of viral proteins observed in parental NIH-3T3 cells except for the P4L-12. However, the P4SC1-31 isolate, exhibiting an intermediate sensitivity to interferon, still exhibited a good discrimination between parental and transformed cells at an MOI of 100 PFU/cell. The two most interferon sensitive isolates (P4L-12 and P4SC1-31) also appeared to synthesize viral proteins at an increased level in Ras-transformed cells as compared to the level reached by the wild-type viral isolates. Among these two, the P4L-12 isolate which has the highest sensitivity to interferon was also the best to discriminate these cells from parental NIH-3T3 cells (Figure 2). 

 EXAMPLE 6 Infection of Ras-transformed cells by the viral isolates measured by viral titration 
 [0089] To verify that the synthesis of viral proteins also reflects production of infectious virus, parental and Ras-transformed cells were infected with the two viral isolates at high (250 PFU/cell) multiplicity of infection. Total production of infectious virus was measured by viral titration. 
 [0090] Parental and Ras-transformed cells were infected at an MOI of 
 250 PFU/cell of either the wild type isolate H8-2 or the P4L-12 isolate. Following freezing and thawing of cells and medium, infectious virus produced after 4 days was measured by determination of virus titer using the TCID50 method. 
 [0091] Although the production of infectious virus was higher in Ras- transformed cells than in parental cells for both viruses, the restriction observed in parental NIH-3T3 cells was more than 200-fold more stringent for the P4L-12 virus than it was for H8-2 (Fig. 3, panel A). The P4L-12 virus resulted in an approximately 40-fold better discrimination index, which is defined as the ratio of replication in Ras-transformed cells compared to that in parental cells. 
 [0092] Discrimination is possibly even better in P4L-12. The observed fivefold lower infectious titer produced with this virus in Ras-transformed, compared to H8-2 is probably due to earlier cell lysis and virus release, as shown below in Example 7, that may limit infectious virus assembly or reduce virus infectivity by prolonged incubation following release. 
 EXAMPLE 7 Infection of Ras-transformed cells by the viral isolates measured by viral assembly and release 

[0093] Virus release was also examined in infected cells by immunoblotting of cell supernatant of cells infected as in Example 6 (Fig. 3, panel B). A small aliquot of the tissue culture medium infected at either a MOI of 10 or 250 was collected and analyzed by immunoblotting using antireovirus antiserum followed by peroxydase conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. 
 [0094] At 4 days post-infection, cell lysis appeared minimal for parental 
 NIH-3T3 cells, as judged by phase contrast microscopy and trypan blue staining. In Ras-transformed cells, cytopathic effect was only apparent at high multiplicity of infection, trypan blue staining indicated between 30 and 50% of cell death in these conditions. Virus release was seen in Ras-transformed cells for both viruses at high MOI while it was only observed for the P4L-12 virus at low MOI. In parental cells, only the H8-2 virus was detected in the medium at high MOI. 
 [0095] This Example and Example 6 confirm that the P4L-12 isolate is better suited to Ras-transformed cells not only in terms of protein synthesis level but also in terms of virus assembly and release. 
 EXAMPLE 8 Effect of interferon in parental and Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells [0096] The effect of interferon on the wild type H8-2 and the P4L-12 isolate in parental as compared to Ras-transformed cells was also assessed. (Figure 4). 
 [0097] Parental (-) or Ras-transformed (+) NIH-3T3 cells were infected with either the H8-2 or P4L-12 virus isolate at low or high MOI indicated on the 
 Figure. In Panel B, cells were treated 24 hours prior infection and during infection so as to maintain antiviral response with 250 lU/ml of interferon. 

Proteins were analyzed by metabolic radiolabeling at 48 hours post-infection followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 
 [0098] In the absence of interferon, synthesis of viral proteins was detected in both cell types with the H8-2 virus at high but not at low MOI; discrimination between the two cell types was thus observed at high MOI with this virus (compare lane 3 to lane 4 in panel A). As also expected, the P4L-12 virus exhibited a better discrimination between parental and Ras-transformed cells. Synthesis of viral proteins in parental cells was barely detectable even at high MOI (lane 7, panel A); furthermore, synthesis of cellular proteins was strongly inhibited, even at low MOI, in Ras-transformed but not in parental cells (compare lane 6 to lane 5 in panel A). At high MOI, the P4L-12 virus essentially killed the cells under the conditions used, thus explaining reduced detection of even the viral proteins (panel A, lane 8). 
 [0099] Treatment with a high concentration (250 lU/ml) of interferon was protective at low MOI with either H8-2 (compare lane 2 in panel B and A) and P4L-12 (compare lane 6 and panel B and A); at high MOI, there was a significant protection in parental cells only for the H8-2 virus (compare lane 3 in panel B and A), thus favoring the discrimination between parental and Ras- transformed cells (compare lane 4 to lane 3 in panel B). 
 [00100] This experiment confirms the suggestion of previous examples that P4L-12 is not only blocked in parental NIH-3T3 cells but also exhibits better cytolytic ability in Ras-transformed cells. Even though it is highly sensitive to interferon, the P4L-12 virus was still the most efficient in Ras- transformed cells even under interferon treatment (lane 8 in panel B). EXAMPLE 9 

 Infection of human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
 [00101] The P4L-12 virus isolate appears to be more strongly restricted than a wild type isolate to untransformed mouse NIH-3T3 cells. However, P4L-12's ability to discriminate between parental and transformed mouse fibrobiasts cells may not be completely predictive of the situation occurring in human cells. 
 [00102] Systemic inoculation could be a very interesting route of administration to ensure that even sites distal to the tumor are reached by the virus (12). With that route, human blood cells will be the first putative target encountered by the virus. The ability of the virus to infect normal blood cells should thus be minimized in an effort to prevent side effects or uncontrolled viral replication. 
 [00103] Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from Dr 
 Jacques Thibodeau's laboratory (Departement de microbiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal) and originally collected from human volunteers. The cells were seeded in 50ml Falcon tissue culture flasks in 5ml of RPMI medium at a concentration of 10 6  viable cells per ml and infected the next day with either H8-2 or P4L-12. 
 [00104] As shown In Figure 5, Panel A, cells were infected at a MOI of 40 and recovered 48 hours later for analysis by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-σ3 antibody (4F2, obtained from Dr. Kevin M. Coombs) followed by a phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed with NBT/BCIP substrate. The control was a small aliquot of purified reovirus serotype 3, showing the position of the σ3 protein. Cells were similarly infected at different multiplicities of infection or left 

uninfected (MOI of 0) (Panel B). Metabolic radiolabeling was performed 48 hours post-infection. 
 [00105] It was observed that the wild type H8-2 virus used at high multiplicity of infection could infect at low level PBMCs in culture while P4L-12 did not detectably infect PBMCs under the same conditions (Figure 5, panel A). 
 [00106] Metabolic radiolabeling was performed on PBMCs infected at different multiplicity of infection to rule out the possibility that residual cell- bound virus was detected. Again, only the H8-2 was able to produce a detectable band of σ3 protein (Figure 5, panel B). EXAMPLE 10 Effect of cathepsin inhibitor E-64 on infection by wild type and P4L-12 reovirus 
 [00107] In addition to restriction to the synthesis of viral proteins due to PKR activity, some cell types are refractory to reovirus infection due to a limited ability to uncoat the virus. This block can be overcome by reovirus mutants exhibiting a single amino acids substitution in their outer capsid protein σ3 which increases their sensitivity to cellular lysosomal proteases known as cathepsins (2,8). 
 [00108] The increased sensitivity to lysosomal proteases of some viral strains can be evidenced by showing the cells' resistance to this virus when it is treated with E-64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, prior to viral infection. 
 [00109] L929 cells were thus seeded at 2,5 X 10 5  cells per 60 mm- diameter petri dish and treated the next day for two hours with 100 μM of E-64 (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario) before being infected at a multiplicity of 

infection of 40 with either the H8-2 or P4L-12 viral isolates or the control PI3-1 virus known to exhibit relative resistance to E-64. Following viral adsorption for one hour at 4 °C, cells were fed with medium containing E-64 and incubated for 22 hours at 37°C before being analyzed for virus infection. Synthesis of viral proteins was detected by metabolic radio labeling. Results are shown on Figure 6 where the position of the σ3 outer capsid protein is indicated. Non-infected cells were similarly treated as a control. 
 [00110] When cells were treated with E-64, viral replication of both the wild type H8-2 virus isolate and the P4L-12 mutant virus isolate were blocked. In contrast, the control PI3-1 virus mutant was resistant to this effect (Figure 6). 
 [00111] This experiment indicates that the molecular determinants of σ3 that could increase sensitivity to lysosomal cathepsins (i.e. need a lesser amount of cathepsin for uncoating in order to display resistance against E64), such as in PI3-1 are not altered in the P4L-12 viral isolate compared to a wild type virus. 
 EXAMPLE 11 Determination of nucleotide sequence of gene S4 and M2 
 [00112] It was then determined whether changes in interferon and/or PKR sensitivity were due to amino acids substitution in either σ3 and/or μ1 viral proteins of P4L-12. 
 [00113] L929 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for approximately 20 hours and recovered by scraping. Virions were extracted by Freon using standard procedures (27). Double-stranded genomic RNA was obtained by SDS-phenol-chloroform extraction of these semipurified virions and 

was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Oligonucleotides corresponding to untranslated 5' and 3' regions of the genomic RNA fragments of either S4 or M2 (encoding respectively σ3 and μ1) were used in a standard reverse transcriptase reaction with Moloney-MuLV reverse transcriptase. Overlapping fragments were then obtained by PCR reactions using oligonucleotides located at various positions along the sequence of each gene. Resulting PCR fragments were then sequenced at the sequencing center of Universite Laval. 
 [00114] The strategy of RT-PCR approach for sequencing limited the possibility that a variant would be sequenced if the DNA was cloned and ensured that the sequence obtained was representative of the viral population. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the DNA product. 
 [00115] A consensus sequence for σ3 amino acids sequence was obtained by aligning the 31 sequences from mammalian reoviral isolates of all 4 serotypes from different laboratories and published in the PubMed™ database (Accession numbers: AF332135; AF332137; AF368037; DQ004470 DQ004471 ; DQ004472; DQ004473; DQ004474; DQ004475; K02739; M13139 NC004265; U15072; U15073; U15074; U15075; U15076; U15077; U15078 U15079; U15080; U15081 ; U15082; U15083; U63303; U63304; U63305 U63306; U63307; X60066; X61586); the H8-2 wild type sequence as well as the previously reported sequence of the ts453 strain (6,25) are also included in the consensus. The 100% consensus was prepared in such a way that, whenever there was variation at a particular position between the 31 sequences compared, a X appears in the consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3). The 31 reoviral isolates include 24 serotype 3, 5 serotype 1, one serotype 2 and one serotype 4. This consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3) was compared with that of the wild type H8-2 isolate (SEQ ID NO: 2) and of the P4L-12 virus mutant (SEQ ID NO: 1) (Figure 7). 

[00116] Five positions were found more variable in the 365 amino acids long sequence, in three cases (amino acids 108, 180 and 347), the amino acid in H8-2 and P4L-12 were the same, indicating the P4L-12 phenotype does not depend of these positions. Furthermore, these three positions varied extensively among the reported sequences. The amino acids found at these positions in our two viral clones are present in approximately one-third of sequence viruses in the database. 
 [00117] At amino acid position 198, the P4L-12 isolate has a glutamic acid while H8-2 has a glycine. Eighteen of the 31 sequences used to derive the consensus along with the original stock used to produce P4L-12 through chemical mutagenesis have a glutamic acid at this position and do not display the particular properties of P4L-12 discussed herein. This indicates that this position is not involved in P4L-12's advantageous phenotype. 
 [00118] The only unique amino acid substitution in the σ3 protein of P4L- 12 virus was found at position 221 where a methionine is substituted for an isoleucine. This substitution is not found in any known σ3 sequences : it is absent from all sequences used to derive the consensus and from that of the original virus stock used for mutagenesis. 
 [00119] In Figure 7, the 5 variable amino acids position are boxed while the unique amino acid substitution at position 221 in P4L-12 is circled. 
 [00120] Similarly, a consensus sequence for μ1 amino acids sequence was obtained by aligning 8 sequences from reoviral isolates of different laboratories obtained from the PubMed™ database (Accession numbers: AF490617; AF368034; J02323; M19345; M19408; M20161 ; NC004270; NC004278) along with the H8-2 sequence. The 8 reoviral isolates include 3 

serotype 3, 3 serotype 1 , one serotype 2 and one serotype 4. This consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6) was compared with that of the wild type H8-2 isolate (SEQ ID NO: 5) and of the P4L-12 virus mutant (SEQ ID NO: 4). In Figure 8, the 11 variable amino acids position are boxed while the unique amino acid substitution at position 315 in P4L-12 is circled. 
 [00121] Eleven positions were found to be more variable in the 708 amino acids long sequence. In 9 of these cases, namely amino acids at positions 51 , 96,109, 128, 327, 340 and 670, the amino acids were the same in H8-2 and P4L-12, indicating that the advantageous P4L-12 phenotype does not depend of these positions. Furthermore, these nine positions varied extensively among the reported sequences. 
 [00122] The two sequences also varied at amino acid position 398. It is unlikely that this position is involved in the observed difference in phenotype between H8-2 and P4L-12 since P4L-12's amino acid at this position was identical to that of all sequences from which the consensus was derived. 
 [00123] The only unique amino acid substitution in the μ1 protein of P4L- 12 virus was found at position 315 where a proline is substituted for a serine. This substitution is absent from the μ1 sequences of all known reoviruses including that of H8-2. 
 [00124] In Figure 8, the 11 variable amino acids position are boxed while the unique amino acid substitution at position 315 in P4L-12 is circled. 
 [00125] Without being so limited, it is hypothesized that the amino acids substitution that affect σ3 and its ability to inhibit PKR needs to be 

compensated by a substitution in μ1 to maintain a normal interaction between the two proteins and that mutants that are hypersensitive to interferon such as P4L-12 could be relatively rare, due to the presence of mutations in two genes. 
 EXAMPLE 12 Molecular probes for mutations found in P4L-12 
 [00126] The nucleotide sequence around mutations found in both S4 and M2 gene of P4L-12 is strictly conserved for at least 12 nucleotides on both side of the mutation in serotype 3 viruses. 
 [00127] A 25 nucleotide-long oligonucleotide with sequence ATGGGGTGTGATCGTTTATGATTAC (SEQ ID NO: 7), where bold-underlined C in P4L-12 replaces a G in the wild type sequence, is thus specific to the S4 gene of P4L-12 and could be developed as a specific probe for wild type vs P4L-12 mutant of serotype 3 viruses. 
 [00128] Similarly sequence GTGTTTGCCATAJCACCTAAACCAG (SEQ ID NO: 8) is specific to M2 gene where bold-underlined T replaces a C in the wild type sequence. 
 [00129] Adequate hybridization conditions using either wild type or mutant oligonucleotides could be used to probe for the presence of mutations at the same position in different viral stocks or isolates. 
 [00130] These probes could be used to rule out the presence of revertant viruses in P4L-12 stocks. 
 [00131] Techniques such as hybridization, RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR 

or SSCP can be used to differentiate wild type sequence from P4L-12 sequence 
 EXAMPLE 13 Selection of viral uncoating mutants [00132] As previously mentioned, uncoating of reovirus virions by lysosomal proteases is often a limiting factor that determines the ability of a given cell line, or cell type, to be efficiently infected by reovirus. 
 [00133] It has been proposed that certain transformed cell types could be more efficiently infected if the uncoating step was bypassed by infection using in vitro uncoated virions known as Infectious Subviral Particles (ISVPs) (10). Uncoating of virions can also be rendered more efficient by certain amino acid substitution in σ3, such as the Y354H substitution (2,8,30,32). 
 [00134] The amino acid substitution found in P4L-12's σ3 is distinct from those known to affect uncoating. It could thus be possible to use P4L-12 as an initial virus isolate to further select viruses that possess additional mutations that favor viral uncoating and thus virus infectivity in addition to P4L-12 advantageous replicative properties. 
 [00135] The P4L-12 virus will be serially passaged in L929 cells in the presence of E-64 protease inhibitor. This procedure is known to put a selective pressure to select viruses harboring mutations that favor viral uncoating (8). 
 [00136] Alternatively, such viruses are selected by ammonium chloride selective pressure (that affects the endosomai pH and thus lysosomal proteases' activity) or by establishing persistently infected cells (that also put a pressure to favor viral uncoating), such as in PI3-1 (2,30). 

[00137] Viruses are cloned, and their replication examined in L929 cells in the presence of interferon, E-64 or both. Their replication in untransformed and Ras-transformed cells are then be examined for those viruses presenting an interferon-hypersensitive/E-64-resistant phenotype. 
 [00138] The presence of P4L-12 mutation in μ1 is confirmed by sequencing and the complete sequence of σ3 is determined to confirm the presence of P4L-12 mutations and to detect mutations affecting viral uncoating. 
 [00139] While P4L-12 may be considered a « second generation » of oncolytic reovirus, viruses combining P4L-12 mutations (and replicative phenotype) with easier uncoating (and thus potentially increased infectivity in transformed/cancer cells) would be considered « third generation ». 
 EXAMPLE 14 Viral infection and replication in human cancer cell lines [00140] In addition to murine Ras-transformed cells, the viral isolates are further characterized in human tumoral (cancer) cell lines. 
 [00141] A classical collection of human cancer cell lines, the NCI 60 collection (26), is examined. Cell lines from different human tumor cell types are infected with H8-2, P4L-12, and future third-generation viral isolates. 
 [00142] In addition to complete virions, « infectious subviral particles », prepared by in vitro pre-treatment with proteolytic enzymes, are used to infect. Such particles are known to bypass restriction at the level of viral uncoating, as previously mentioned. 

[00143] Viral replication are examined as in previous examples by looking at synthesis of viral proteins, viral release, and virus titer. 
 [00144] This will allow to determine which cancer cell types are most likely to be adequate target for reovirus, and in which cancer cell types our novel viral isolates will be most advantageous compared to wild type reovirus. 
 EXAMPLE 15 Determination of maximum tolerated dose for P4L-12 in mouse models 
 [00145] Compared to a wild type virus isolate (such as H8-2) the novel 
 P4L-12 mutant virus presents a greater restriction to replication in untransformed mouse cells and human PBMCs, rendering this virus potentially safer. 
 [00146] The increase in virus maximum tolerated dose, via different route of inoculation is established in murine models. As used herein, maximum tolerated dose is defined by the maximum dose that does not kill any animals in a group of at least 10 animals up to 4 weeks post-inoculation. In addition to the increase in virus dose that can be safely administered, virus growth in various tissues is examined by virus titration in a few animals. 
 [00147] Viruses prepared for inoculation is recovered by extraction from infected L929 cells in suspension culture and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a sterile cesium chloride cushion at a density of 1.32 g/ml. 
 [00148] Suckling mice are more susceptible to the reovirus-induced disease, although adult mice can support viral replication to a certain extent. Both models are thus studied. 

[00149] Intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracranial and intranasal routes of inoculation are examined. These different routes represent a large spectrum of possibility for treatment of primary tumors (such as gliomas) and metastatic tumors and are also classical routes of inoculation to demonstrate reovirus pathogenic potential. 
 [00150] In addition, nude mice as a model of immunodeficient animal is inoculated solely via the intravenous route. 
 [00151] Wild type virus is used at the known maximum tolerated dose for each route and P4L-12 is used at the same dose, and at 10-fold increment up to 100-fold. 
 [00152] Groups of approximately 10-12 animals from at least two different litters are inoculated for each virus, inoculation route and virus dose. These inoculated animals are examined daily for obvious signs of disease and cumulative deaths (and development of disease) are measured. 
 [00153] The effect of pre or post-inoculation administration of interferon is also examined. 
 [00154] In addition, 1 or 2 animals from each litter (depending on litter size) are sacrificed 48 hours post-inoculation. Organs are recovered (blood, spleen, lungs, liver, brain, heart, kidney, intestine) and viruses are titered in cell-free lysates from these organs. 
 EXAMPLE 16 Oncolytic activity of P4L-12 in mouse models 

[00155] Following determination of the spectrum and preferred target of 
 P4L-12 in cultured human tumor cells (Example 14) and that of maximum tolerated dose in animals (Example 15) the oncolytic activity in some established mouse models is examined. 
 [00156] Two different approaches, already well established in the study of oncolytic reoviruses, are used in order to examine the oncolytic effect in the context of immunocompetent animals using histocompatible murine tumor cells or immunodeficient animals against human tumoral cells. 
 [00157] In a first set of experiments, systemic reovirus therapy in immunocompetent mice is examined (12). Histocompatible Ras-transformed fibrobiasts are injected via the tail vein to form lung metastases. Reovirus isolates are injected via the same route either at early stages of the disease (5 days post inoculation of tumoral cells) or at later stages (14 days). The virus is injected at the same dose, corresponding to the maximum tolerated dose of H8-2, and P4L-12 at its own maximum tolerated dose. 
 [00158] In a second set of experiments, human tumoral cells forming solid tumors (colon, breast or ovarian cancers) are implanted as xenografts in the hind flank of nude mice (11). Again, maximum tolerated dose of the different viruses are inoculated via the tail vein in order to assess the ability of these viruses to kill tumor cells via systemic inoculation. 
 [00159] In all cases, survival of animal is followed over time for a period of at least 6 weeks. Groups of at least 10-12 animals from at least two different litters will be used in each group. 
 [00160] Statistical significance in survival between control animals 

(inoculated with tumor cells but left untreated) are established by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
