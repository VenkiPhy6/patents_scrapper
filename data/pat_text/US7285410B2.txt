 This is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/338,471 filed Jan. 24, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,562, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/431,965, filed May 8, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,198,926. 
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention relates to a biocatalytic, regioselective method for preparing (E)- and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acids (2M2BA) in high yields and two new microbial catalyst compositions useful in the method. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 (E)-2-methyl-2-buteneoic acid ((E)-2M2BA) (commonly known as tiglic acid) and (Z)-2-methyl-2-buteneoic acid ((Z)-2M2BA) (commonly known as angelic acid) are useful starting materials for preparing flavors and fragrances, and for preparing pharmaceutical intermediates. 
 (Z)-2M2BA has been prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding (Z)-alcohol with manganese dioxide, followed by the oxidation of the resulting aldehyde with sodium chlorite in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydrogen phosphate (M. Zaidlewicz, Z. Walasek, PL 169502 B1 (1996)). R. E. Buckles and G. V. Mock reported the preparation of (E)-2M2BA in 53% yield by the action of 100% sulfuric acid on 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyronitrile, followed by hydrolysis of the resulting (E)-2-methyl-2-butenamide ( J. Org. Chem.,  15:680-684 (1950)). The (E)-2M2BA produced by the Buckles-Mock process was further converted to (Z)-2M2BA in 33% yield by bromination of (E)-2M2BA to 2,3-dibromo-2-methylbutyric acid, debromination to (Z)-2-bromo-2-methylbutenoic acid using methanolic potassium hydroxide, followed by reduction of the bromo-acid using sodium amalgam. 
 (E)-2M2BA has been prepared in 89% yield by the carbonylation of 2-chloro-2-butene using catalytic quantities of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and nickel cyanide (H. Alper et al.,  Tetrahedron Lett.,  30:2615-2616 (1989)). Similarly, treatment of (E)- or (Z)-2-bromo-2-butene with carbon monoxide and octacarbonyldicolbalt in the presence of methyl iodide and calcium hydroxide in dioxane-water gave only (E)-2M2BA in 87-88% yield (M. Masahiro et al.,  J. Chem. Soc.,  Perkin Transactions 1 (1):73-76 (1989)). (E)-2M2BA has also been produced in 3% yield by UV irradiation of (Z)-2M2BA for 43 days, followed by separation of the (E)- and (Z)-isomers by a combination of fractional crystallizations and extractions (S. W. Pelletier and W. L. McLeish,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  74:6292-6293 (1952)). 
 Nitriles are readily converted to the corresponding carboxylic acids by a variety of chemical processes, but these processes typically require strongly acidic or basic reaction conditions, high reaction temperatures, and produce unwanted byproducts and/or large amounts of inorganic salts as unwanted waste. These chemical processes for nitrile hydrolysis are not known to result in the regioselective hydrolysis of mixtures of geometric isomers of nitriles. U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,646 describes a process where (E,Z)-2M2BN is reacted with sulfuric acid at elevated temperatures, followed by distillation of the product mixture to produce a mixture of 80.5% (Z)-2M2BA and 19.5% (E)-2M2BA; pure (Z)-2M2BA was prepared by fractional crystallization of the (E,Z)-2M2BA mixture. 2-Methyl-3-butenenitrile (2M3BN), a commercially-available by-product produced during the manufacture of adiponitrile by hydrocyanation of butadiene, is readily isomerized to a mixture of (E)-2M2BN and (Z)-2M2BN, but separating this mixture by distillation is difficult and expensive due to the similar boiling points and chemical properties of the geometric isomers. 
 The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitrile-containing substrates to the corresponding carboxylic acids is often preferred to chemical methods because the reactions are often run at ambient temperature, do not require the use of strongly acidic or basic reaction conditions, and produce the desired product with high selectivity at high conversion. 
 A nitrilase enzyme directly converts a nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid ammonium salt in aqueous solution without the intermediate formation of an amide. Nitrilases have been identified in a variety of microorganisms. For example, Kobayashi et al. ( Tetrahedron  46:5587-5590 (1990);  J. Bacteriology,  172:4807-4815 (1990)) have described an aliphatic nitrilase isolated from  Rhodococcus rhodochrous  K22 that catalyzed the hydrolysis of aliphatic nitriles to their corresponding carboxylic acid ammonium salts. A nitrilase from  Rhodococcus rhodochrous  NCIMB 40757 or NCIMB 40833 has been used to convert acrylonitrile to ammonium acrylate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,180). A nitrilase from  Comamonas testosteroni  has been isolated that can convert a range of aliphatic α,ω-dinitriles to either the corresponding ω-cyanocarboxylic acid ammonium salt or dicarboxylic acid diammonium salt (CA 2,103,616; S. Lévy-Schil et al.,  Gene,  161:15-20 (1995)). The regioselective hydrolysis of aliphatic α,ω-dinitriles to the corresponding ω-cyanocarboxylic acid ammonium salts by the nitrilase activity of  Acidovorax facilis  72W has also been reported (Gavagan et al.,  J. Org. Chem.,  63:4792-4801 (1998)). The nitrilase gene from  Arthrobacter  sp. NSSC104 has been cloned (WO 0314355), and a variety of bacterial nitrilases exhibiting stereoselectivity have been identified (WO 0300840). 
 A combination of two enzymes, nitrile hydratase and amidase, can also be used to convert aliphatic nitrites to the corresponding carboxylic acid ammonium salts in aqueous solution. Here the aliphatic nitrile is initially converted to an amide by the nitrile hydratase and then the amide is subsequently converted by the amidase to the corresponding carboxylic acid ammonium salt. Bacterial genera (including  Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Bacteridium, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium,  and  Micrococcus ) are known to possess a broad spectrum of various nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. Cowan et al. ( Extremophiles,  2:207-216 (1998)) and Martinkova and Kren ( Biocatalysis and Biotransformation,  20:73-93 (2002)) have reviewed the nitrilase and nitrile hydratase/amidase enzyme systems of nitrile-degrading microorganisms. 
 Effenberger and Osswald ( Tetrahedron,  12:2581-2587 (2001)) have reported the (E)-selective hydrolysis of (E,Z)-α,β-unsaturated nitrites by the recombinant nitrilase AtNIT1 from  Arabidopsis thaliana,  where the (E)-isomer of the (E,Z)-3-substituted-acrylonitrile mixtures was exclusively hydrolyzed in the presence of the corresponding (Z)-isomer; no 2,3-disubstituted acrylonitriles were examined as substrate for this nitrilase. When (E,Z)-3-heptenenitrile was used as substrate with this same nitrilase, enrichment of one isomer was not observed for either nitrile or acid. Almatawah et al. ( Extremophiles,  3:283-291 (1999)) have reported that the nitrilase of  Bacillus pallidus  Dac521 showed no activity for hydrolysis of cis-2-pentenenitrile, but was capable of hydrolyzing acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, or crotononitrile; no 2,3-disubstituted acrylonitriles were examined as substrate for this nitrilase. Zhao and Wang ( Chinese J. Chem.,  20:1291-1299 (2002)) demonstrated that the combined nitrile hydratase and amidase activities of  Rhodococcus  sp. AJ270 could be used for the enantioselective biotransformation of racemic β-substituted-α-methylenepropionitriles. Where the amidase was shown by Zhao and Wang supra to discriminate between the two amide hydration products produced by the nitrile hydratase, no 2,3-disubstituted acrylonitriles were examined as substrate for this combination of nitrile hydratase/amidase enzymes. 
 The problem to be solved, therefore, is the lack of a process for the facile preparation of (E)- and (Z)-2M2BA from a mixture of (E,Z)-2M2BN using an enzyme catalyst having either nitrilase activity or a combination of nitrile hydratase and amidase activities, where the enzyme catalyst is regioselective for the hydrolysis or hydration of one of the two geometric isomers of (E,Z)-2M2BN. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 A process is disclosed for preparing (E)- and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acids (2M2BA) in high yield and purity from a mixture of (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitriles (2M2BN) by the regioselective hydrolysis of (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (2M2BA), without significant conversion of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. The invention has the steps of (a) contacting (E,Z)-2M2BN in an aqueous reaction mixture with an enzyme catalyst expressing a regioselective nitrilase activity; (b) separating the (E)-2M2BA produced in step (a) from unreacted (Z)-2M2BN, and (c) converting (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. More particularly, (E)-2M2BN is converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid (as the ammonium salt) with high regioselectivity at 100% conversion, using a regioselective nitrilase as catalyst. The regioselective hydrolysis of (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA (as the ammonium salt) makes possible the facile separation of (E)-2M2BA from (Z)-2M2BN, and for the subsequent conversion of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA in high yield and purity. 
 Microorganisms characterized by a nitrilase activity and useful in the process are  Acidovorax facilis  72-PF-15 (ATCC 55747) and  Acidovorax facilis  72-PF-1 7 (ATCC 55745). Additionally, transformed microbial cells containing  A. facilis  72W nitrilase activity are included in this invention.  Escherichia coli  SS1001 (ATCC PTA-1177) and  Escherichia coli  SW91 (ATCC PTA-1175) are examples of such a transformed microbial cell catalyst. 
 A further embodiment of the invention is the use of the  A. facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) strain that expresses (1) regioselective and chemoselective nitrilase activity and (2) a non-regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activity, as an enzyme catalyst for regioselective hydrolysis of (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA. Prior to use as catalyst, whole  A. facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) microbial cells are heated to a temperature of about 35° C. to 70° C. for between 10 and 120 minutes, whereby the non-regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activity is destroyed and the regioselective nitrilase activity is preserved. Where the transformed whole microbial cell expresses regioselective and chemoselective nitrilase activity and lacks the non-regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities, no heat-treatment step is needed.  Escherichia coli  SS1001 (ATCC PTA-1177) and  Escherichia coli  SW91 (ATCC PTA-1175) are examples of a transformed microbial cell catalyst that lack non-regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. 
 A further embodiment of the invention uses a catalyst having a combination of a regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. The invention has the steps of (a) contacting (E,Z)-2M2BN in an aqueous reaction mixture with an enzyme catalyst expressing a combination of regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities; (b) separating the (E)-2M2BA produced in step (a) from unreacted (Z)-2M2BN and/or (Z)-2M2BAm, and (c) conversion of (Z)-2M2BN and/or (Z)-2M2BAm to (Z)-2M2BA. More particularly, (E)-2M2BN is converted to the corresponding carboxylic acid (as the ammonium salt) with high regioselectivity at 100% conversion, by a combination of regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities derived from the group of microbial catalysts consisting of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM4D,  Comamonas testosteroni  S2B-1 (ATCC PTA-5135), and  Comamonas testosteroni  S5C(ATCC PTA-5134). The regioselective hydrolysis of (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA makes possible the facile separation of (E)-2M2BA from unreacted (Z)-2M2BN and/or (Z)-2M2BAm), and for the subsequent conversion of (Z)-2M2BN and/or (Z)-2M2BAm to (Z)-2M2BA. 
 Further embodiments of the invention use an enzyme catalyst in the form of intact microbial cells, permeabilized microbial cells, one or more cell components of a microbial cell extract, and partially-purified enzyme(s), or purified enzyme(s). These different forms of enzyme catalyst can be immobilized on or in a soluble or insoluble support using techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 Applicants have solved the stated problem by providing a process to prepare (E)- and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acids (2M2BA) in high yield and at high concentration in the reaction mixture starting from a mixture of (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitriles (2M2BN) and using a catalyst having either a nitrilase activity or a combination of nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. Applicants have isolated and characterized two new microbial catalysts,  C. testosteroni  S2B-1 (ATCC PTA-5135) and  C. testosteroni  S5C (ATCC PTA-5134), which have a combination of regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities useful for converting the (E)-2M2BN component of (E,Z)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA, without concomitant hydrolysis of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. 
 The method regioselectively hydrolyzes (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (2M2BA). The method provides high yields without significant conversion of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. The regioselective hydrolysis of (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA makes possible the facile separation of (E)-2M2BA (as the ammonium salt) from (Z)-2M2BN or (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenamide (2M2BAm), and for the subsequent conversion of (Z)-2M2BN or (Z)-2M2BAm to (Z)2M2BA. 
 (E)- and (Z)-2M2BA are useful for preparing flavor and fragrance ingredients, as well as in for preparing pharmaceutical intermediates. The process has the added industrial advantages of low temperature and energy requirements and low waste or byproduct production relative to previously known chemical methods. 
 Microbial catalysts can hydrolyze a nitrile directly to the corresponding carboxylic acids using 1) a nitrilase (EC 3.5.5.7) enzyme without intermediate production of the corresponding amide (Equation 1), or 2) a combination of nitrile hydratase (EC 4.2.1.84) and amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) enzymes, in which case a nitrile hydratase (NHase) initially converts a nitrile to an amide, and then the amide is subsequently converted by the amidase to the corresponding carboxylic acid (Equation 2): 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 In the present invention, microbial catalysts having nitrilase activity, or a combination of nitrile hydratase and amidase activities, have been identified which can convert the (E)-2M2BN component of a mixture of (E,Z)-2M2BN with high regiospecificity to the corresponding carboxylic acid at high concentration and at complete conversion of the nitrile. The process gives no significant conversion of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. The identified catalysts of the present invention eliminate the need for close monitoring over the course of the reaction to maintain a low concentration of nitrile, and do not require the reaction be run at a low temperature (5-10° C.) to maintain the stability of the enzyme catalyst. Instead, the process uses either a thermally-stable nitrilase or a combination of thermostable nitrile hydratase and amidase enzymes as catalysts for the desired conversions. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,736 describes using the nitrilase activity of a microbe,  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746), as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of aliphatic α,ω-dinitriles to the corresponding ω-cyanocarboxylic acids and ammonia in an aqueous reaction mixture. The nitrilase catalyzed the hydrolysis of an α-alkyl-α,ω-dinitrile to the ω-cyanocarboxylic acid resulting from hydrolysis of the ω-cyano group with at least 98% regioselectivity at 100% conversion. U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,508 describes a process whereby heating a suspension of  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) in a suitable buffer at 50° C. for a short period of time deactivates an undesirable nitrile hydratase and amidase activity of the whole-cell catalyst, without producing a significant decrease in the desired nitrilase activity. 
 The complete regioselectivity of the nitrilase catalysts of the present invention for hydrolysis of only (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, with no detectable hydrolysis of (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile under the same reaction conditions, was unexpected and could not have been predicted. U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,736 describes the use of the nitrilase catalysts of the present invention for the hydrolysis of 2-methylglutaronitrile and 2-methyleneglutaronitrile to the corresponding ω-cyanocarboxylic acids; for the hydrolysis of 2-methylglutaronitrile, no 2-methyl4-cyanobutanoic acid was produced, and 2-methylglutaric acid was produced at <2% total yield at complete conversion of 2-methylglutaronitrile, whereas for hydrolysis of 2-methylenegluraronitrile, 4-cyano-4-pentenoic acid was the only hydrolysis product, and there was no hydrolysis of the cyano group vicinal to the α-methylene substituent. 
 In contrast, the accompanying examples demonstrate that the nitrilase catalysts described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,736 are capable of catalyzing the complete conversion of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile, (cis)-2-pentenenitrile, and (trans)-2-pentenenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Neither the presence or absence of a methyl or methylene substituent at the a-position relative to a cyano group, nor the presence or absence of α,β-unsaturation relative to the position of a cyano group, could be used to predict if an α-alkyl substituted nitrile is a substrate for the nitrilase catalysts of the present invention. Similarly, it could not have been predicted whether or not the nitrile hydratase and amidase catalysts of the present invention would exhibit regioselectivity towards hydrolysis of geometric isomers of 2,3-disubstituted acrylonitriles such as (E)- and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile. 
 It was also not previously known nor predicted before Applicants' invention that the regioselective nitrilase biocatalysts derived from  Acidovorax facilis  72W would be stable to the high concentrations of (E,Z)-α,β-unsaturated nitrile and (E)-α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid present over the course of a single reaction, or over the course of a series of reactions when the catalyst was recycled to produce (E)-2M2BA at high concentration. In particular, the nitrilase enzyme of the present invention relies on the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine in the active site of the enzyme for its catalytic activity (WO 0175077 A2), and α,β-unsaturated nitrites, amides and carboxylic acids are known to be highly reactive towards sulfhydryl groups, where a sulfhydryl group may react at the β-position of these compounds and thereby irreversibly inactivate the enzyme. 
 U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,736 also describes the use of a combination of a regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities of  C. testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D (ATCC 55744), as catalyst for the hydrolysis of aliphatic α,ω-dinitriles to the corresponding ω-cyanocarboxylic acids in an aqueous reaction mixture. This microbe exhibits both non-regioselective and regioselective nitrile hydratase activities, but heating a suspension of  C. testosteroni  5-MGAM4D in a suitable buffer at 50° C. for a short period of time deactivates the undesirable non-regioselective nitrile hydratase of the microbial cell catalyst, without producing a significant decrease in the desired regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. In the present application, no heat-treatment of  C. testosteroni  5-MGAM4D is required for regioselective hydrolysis of (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA, where there is no concomitant hydrolysis of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. 
 Microbial Catalysts 
 Applicants have isolated and characterized two new microbial catalysts,  C. testosteroni  S2B-1 (ATCC PTA-5135) and  C. testosteroni  S5C (ATCC PTA-5134), which have a combination of regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase activities useful for converting the (E)-2M2BN component of (E,Z)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA, without concomitant hydrolysis of (Z)-2M2BN to (Z)-2M2BA. 
 In the present invention, the  C. testosteroni  catalysts utilize two enzyme activities to convert (E)-2M2BN to (E)-2M2BA. It was not previously known (and could not have been predicted) that both the regioselective nitrile hydratase and amidase enzymes would be stable to the high concentrations of α,β-unsaturated nitriles, amides, and carboxylic acids present over the course of a single reaction or over the course of a series of reactions when the catalyst was recycled to produce (E)-2M2BA at high concentration. All known amidase enzymes, including those of the present invention, rely on the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine in the active site of the enzyme for their catalytic activity, and α,β-unsaturated nitrites, amides, and carboxylic acids are known to be highly reactive towards sulfhydryl groups, where a sulfhydryl group may react at the β-position of the compounds and thereby irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.

 The inoculum from the shake flask was transferred aseptically to a pre-sterilized Braun Biostat C fermentor containing Fermentor Medium listed below. Growth occurred under the following conditions: 32° C., pH 6.8-7.0, dissolved oxygen at 25% of saturation. At inoculation the fermentor contained 8.5 L of Fermentor Medium plus 218 g of Nutrient Feed solution, giving a starting concentration of approximately 7 g/L glycerol. The Nutrient Feed solution includes the following components that were sterilized separately and combined after cooling: potassium phosphate, monobasic, 19.6 g in 0.25 L deionized water; magnesium sulfate, heptahydrate, 3.3 g, plus sulfuric acid, 4 mL, in 0.15 L deionized water; Trace Metal solution, 67 mL, plus 400 g glycerol in 0.80 L deionized water. At 18 h post inoculation, feeding of Nutrient Feed solution began. Initially, the Nutrient Feed solution was added at a rate of 0.4 g feed/minute (0.15 g glycerol/min). The culture OD 550 was approximately 8-9. At 26 h, the feed rate was increased to 0.9 g feed/minute (0.3 g glycerol/min). The OD 550 was approximately 16-18. A final increase in feed rate to 1.8 g feed/minute (0.6 g glycerol/min) was made at 34 h. This rate was maintained to the end of run (about 42 h). The final OD 550 was approximately 65-75.

 Cells, as wet cell paste, were recovered by centrifugation and stored frozen until use. Dry cell weight of wet cell paste, obtained by lyophilization, was typically 24% of wet cell weight.  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) cells were heated to 50° C. for 1 h in 0.35 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to inactivate nitrile hydratase activity before use as a catalyst 
 Two mutants of the  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) strain have been prepared (U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,736, incorporated by reference) which produce only very low levels of the nitrile hydratase activity of the parent strain. These nitrile hydratase-deficient mutant strains derived from  A. facilis  72W ( Acidovorax facilis  72-PF-15 (ATCC 55747) and  Acidovorax facilis  72-PF-17 (ATCC 55745)), do not require heat-treatment of the cells prior to use as an enzyme catalyst for the hydrolysis of (E,Z)-2M2BN to a mixture of (E)-2M2BA and (Z)-2M2BN. 
 Preparation of Cell Extract and Purification of Nitrilase Protein 
 All steps in this procedure were performed at 5° C. and at pH 7.5 unless otherwise stated. 
 A 25 wt % suspension of  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) wet cell paste was prepared in 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 2.0 mM dithiothreitol. 
 An extract of this suspension was prepared by passage through a French press (American Instrument Co., Silver Springs, Md., USA) according to methods known to the art. Following a centrifugation at 27,500×g for 30 min to remove cell debris, a 20-55% ammonium sulfate fractionation of the extract was prepared and then concentrated by overnight precipitation following the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 65% of saturation. The concentrated protein precipitate was reconstituted using a minimum volume of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (Buffer A) and desalted over a PD10 column containing Sephadex G-25 resin (Pharmacia, Milwaukee, Wis.). Following desalting, the concentrated protein extract was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography using a column containing 50 mL of Q-Sparse fast flow (Pharmacia). After loading the column with the concentrated protein extract, the column was washed with three column volumes of Buffer A at a flow rate of 2 mL/min to remove un-adsorbed protein. Adsorbed protein was eluted from the column using a 0-0.5 M NaCl gradient prepared in Buffer A. Elution of protein from the column was monitored at 280 nm. 
 Nitrilase activity was monitored throughout purification using an assay measuring the hydrolysis of benzonitrile to produce benzoic acid (Gavagan et al.,  Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,  52:654-659 (1999)). Nitrilase activity eluted at 0.4 M NaCl. Protein components in the 0.4 M NaCl protein fraction were separated by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) performed under reducing conditions (5% β-mercaptoethanol) on a 10-15% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Greater than 50% of the 0.4 M NaCl protein fraction consisted of a protein with subunit molecular weight of 39.7 kd. Using methods known in the art, the native molecular weight of the nitrilase was determined to be 570 kd following gel filtration chromatography in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7 using a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) that had been calibrated using gel filtration MW standards (Pharmacia #17-0442-01). Following gel filtration, the nitrilase protein was >90% pure. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was determined to be 35 IU/mg protein using 2-methylglutaronitrile as substrate at 25° C. 
 Preparation of  Escherichia coli  SS1001 (ATCC PTA-1177) and  Escherichia coli  SW91 (ATCC PTA-1175) 
 The nitrilase gene (SEQ ID NO 1) of  Acidovorax facilis  72W was cloned and sequenced, and over-expressed in  Escherichia coli  to produce two  E. coli  transformants,  E. coli  SS1001 (ATCC PTA-1177) and  E. coli  SW91 (ATCC PTA-1175). These procedures have been described in WO 0175077 A2 (equivalent to US PAT APP 2001/823373, which is incorporated by reference). 
 The nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) and deduced amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:4) for the nitrilase expressed in  E. coli  SS1001 contains two minor nucleotide substitutions in comparison to wild type  Acidovorax facilis  72W nitrilase sequence. First, the start codon is ATG instead of GTG to facilitate expression in  E. coli.  Second, a single nucleotide substitution at position 1098 was introduced during the cloning process, resulting in a corresponding amino acid change of proline (CCA) to serine (TCA) near the C-terminal end of the polypeptide (SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4).

 Isolation, Growth, and Nitrile Hydrolysis Activity of  Comamonas testosteroni  S2B-1 (ATCC PTA-5135) and  Comamonas testosteroni  S5C (ATCC PTA-5134) 
   Comamonas testosteroni  S2B-1 and  Comamonas testosteroni  S5C were isolated from extracts of soil collected in Orange, Tex., U.S.A., using standard enrichment procedures using S12-N medium. S12-N medium contains the following: Na 2 SO 4 , 10 mM; potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mM; MgCl 2 , 2 mM; CaCl 2 , 0.7 mM; MnCl 2 , 50 μM; FeCl 3 , 1 μM; ZnCl 3 , 1 μM; CuSO 4 , 1.72 μM; CoCl 2 , 2.53 μM; Na 2 MoO 2 , 2.42 μM; FeSO 4 , 0.0001%; yeast extract, 0.001%; and thiamine hydrochloride, 2 μM. The enrichment culture was established by inoculating 10 μL of soil extract into 10 mL of S12-N medium in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The enrichment culture was supplemented with 100 ppm 3-hydroxyvaleronitrile (3-HVN) added directly to the culture medium and was incubated at 30° C. with reciprocal shaking. The enrichment culture was maintained by adding 100 ppm of 3-HVN every 2-3 days. The culture was diluted every 4-6 days by replacing 9 mL of the culture with the same volume of S12-N medium. Bacteria that utilize 3-HVN as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy or as a nitrogen source were isolated by spreading samples of the enrichment culture onto S12-N agar (S12-N medium with 1.5% Difco Noble Agar). 3-HVN (10 μL) was placed on the interior of each Petri dish lid. The Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated upside down at 28° C. Representative bacterial colonies were then single colony passaged several times on S12-N agar with 3-HVN supplied on the interior of each Petri dish lid.  Comamonas testosteroni  S2B-1 and  Comamonas testosteroni  S5C were among the strains isolated using this procedure. 
   Comamonas testosteroni  S5C was grown in shake flask culture using E2 medium w/3-HVN as sole carbon and nitrogen source. The culture was incubated at 30° C. for 20 h with agitation set to 200 rpm. 
   Comamonas testosteroni  S2B-1 was grown aerobically for 29 h in a10 L fermentation. An inoculum was prepared by growth of a stock culture of either strain at 32° C. for 15 h in a 2.0 L unbaffled shake flask containing 500 mL of the medium described below in an incubator shaker set at an agitation rate of 300 rpm. At inoculation, the fermentor contained 8.5 L of Fermentor Medium. Dissolved oxygen was held at 25% of saturation, at 32° C., and pH at 6.8-7.0.

 Harvested cells were frozen at −65 to −70° C. until used for nitrile transformation. The 10 L fermentation method described above was also used for the growth of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM4D. 
 Whole cells of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM4D,  Comamonas testosteroni  S2B-1, and  Comamonas testosteroni  S5C, respectively, were tested for nitrile hydratase and amidase activity using either 3-hydroxyvaleronitrile or 3-hydroxyvaleramide as substrate at a concentration of 0.5 M. A 50 mg (dry cell weight)/mL cell suspension was prepared in 0.10 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Into a 20-mL glass scintillation vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar was added 3.0 mL of an aqueous solution of either 0.667 M 3-HVA or 0.667 3-HVAm at 25° C. With stirring, 1.0 mL of the cell suspension at 25° C. was added. At 5, 10, and 15 min after the addition of the cell suspension, a 100 μL aliquot was removed from the reaction mixture, mixed with 20 μL of 6.0 N HCl, 100 μL of deionized water, and 200 μL of 0.20 M sodium butyrate (HPLC external standard). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC for the rate of production of either 3-HVAm from 3-HVA or 3-HVA from 3-HVAm. 
 A unit of nitrile hydratase or amidase activity (IU) is equivalent to production of 1 micromole 3-HVAm or 3-HVA/min, respectively. The activity level is reported as units per gram of dry cell weight and is reported in the following table (Table 1).

Use of Nitrilase or Nitrile Hydratase/Amidase Biocatalysts for the Regioselective Hydrolysis of (E)-2-Methyl-2-butenenitrile to (E)-2-Methyl-2-butenoic acid in a mixture of (E,Z)-2-Methyl-2-butenenitriles
 
 Intact microbial cells having nitrilase or nitrile hydratase/amidase activities can be used as catalyst without any pretreatment, or the microbial cells may be permeabilized by methods familiar to those skilled in the art, e.g., treatment with toluene, detergents, or freeze thawing, to improve the rate of diffusion of materials into and out of the cells (H. Felix,  Anal. Biochem.,  120:211-234 (1982)). 
 The microbial cell catalyst can be immobilized in a polymer matrix, including but not limited to alginate, carrageenan, polyvinyl alcohol, or polyacrylamide gel, or on a soluble or insoluble support, including but not limited to celite, ion exchange resins, and polymethylmethacrylate, to facilitate recovery and reuse of the catalyst. The enzyme activity or activities can also be isolated from the microbial cells and used directly as catalyst, or the enzyme activity or activities can be immobilized in a polymer matrix or on a soluble or insoluble support. Methods to immobilize cells in a polymer matrix or on a soluble or insoluble support have been widely reported, as have methods for the immobilization of partially-purified or purified enzymes, and are well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example,  Methods in Biotechnology,  Vol. 1 : Immobilization of Enzymes and Cells;  Gordon F. Bickerstaff, Editor; Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., USA; 1997). 
 Examples of specific enzymes useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the  Acidovorax facilis  72W nitrilase (ATCC 55746; SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2) and transformants, such as  Escherichia coli  SS1001, expressing a modified version of the 72W nitrilase (SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4). Additionally, a combination of nitrile hydratase and amidase activity is also useful in the present invention. 
 The concentration of enzyme catalyst in the reaction mixture depends on the catalyst's specific activity and is chosen to obtain the desired rate of reaction. When using unimmobilized intact or permeabilized microbial cells as enzyme catalyst, the wet cell weight (wcw) of the microbial cell catalyst in a reaction mixture typically ranges from 0.001 g to 0.200 g of wet cells per mL of total reaction volume, preferably from 0.002 g to 0.050 g of wet cells per mL. When using immobilized intact or permeabilized microbial cells as enzyme catalyst, the amount of the immobilized cell catalyst in a reaction mixture typically ranges from 0.001 g to 0.400 g of catalyst per mL of total reaction volume, preferably from 0.050 g to 0.250 g of immobilized cell catalyst per mL. Soluble or immobilized enzymes are employed as enzyme catalysts in amounts which vary with the specific activity of the enzyme catalyst, but are typically in the ranges of 0.001 g to 0.050 g of soluble enzyme per mL of total reaction volume, and 0.010 g to 0.200 g of immobilized enzyme per mL of total reaction volume (but not limited to these ranges). The specific activity of a nitrilase catalyst (IU/gram catalyst) is determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, and the specific activity of a nitrile hydratase/amidase catalyst is determined by measuring the rate of hydration of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the corresponding amide (for nitrile hydratase specific activity) and the rate of hydrolysis of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenamide to the corresponding carboxylic acid (for amidase specific activity) of a 0.14 M solution of the appropriate substrate at 25° C., using a known weight of the catalyst. An IU of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme activity required to convert one micromole of substrate to product per minute. 
 The method of the present invention is useful for converting (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid. The method of the present invention is also useful for converting (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile in a mixture of (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, thereby allowing for the facile recovery of the carboxylic acid (as the ammonium salt) from the product mixture which additionally contains unreacted (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile (when a nitrilase catalyst is used) or unreacted (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenamide (when a nitrile hydratase/amidase catalyst is used). 
 For the biocatalytic conversion of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, an aqueous reaction mixture containing the nitrile is prepared by mixing (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, or (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, with an aqueous suspension of the enzyme catalyst. (E)-2-Methyl-2-butenenitrile, (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile and (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile are only moderately water soluble, ca 1.1 wt % (0.14 M) in the reaction mixture at 22° C. Their solubility also depends on the temperature of the solution and the salt concentration in the aqueous phase; the optional inclusion of a buffer, or the production of the ammonium salt of a carboxylic acid are two possible sources of salt in a reaction mixture. 
 In the present application, producing a reaction product at a concentration greater than the solubility limit of the starting nitrile is accomplished using a reaction mixture that is initially composed of two phases: an aqueous phase (containing the enzyme catalyst and dissolved aliphatic or aromatic nitrile) and an organic phase (the undissolved nitrile, optionally dissolved in an organic solvent not miscible with the aqueous phase). As the reaction progresses, the nitrile dissolves into the aqueous phase, eventually yielding a product mixture which may be a single phase, depending on the solubility of the products (and remaining starting material, if any) in water, and on the presence or absence of an optional organic solvent not miscible with water. Examples of optional organic solvents added to a reaction mixture include, but are not limited to, toluene, methyl-t-butyl ether, dichloromethane, and methyl isobutyl ketone. 
 The amount of water present in the reaction mixture containing (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile or (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile and an enzyme catalyst may be, at a minimum, only as much water as is sufficient to result in a) complete conversion of the nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, and b) maintenance of the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme catalyst. The reaction may also be run by adding (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile or (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to the reaction mixture at a rate approximately equal to the enzymatic reaction rate, thereby maintaining a single-phase aqueous reaction mixture, thereby avoiding the potential problem of substrate inhibition of the enzyme at high starting material concentrations. 
 The concentration of carboxylic acid product in the reaction mixture (as the ammonium salt) may range from 1 mM to 7 M, preferably between 100 mM and 4 M, and most preferably between 1 M and 3 M. The (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile or (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile may be added to a suitable reaction mixture in one portion, or may be added continuously as the nitrile is hydrolyzed to maintain a low concentration of the nitrile over the course of the reaction, thus limiting any potential inhibitory affects of the starting material or products on the enzyme catalyst activity. 
 The temperature of the reaction is chosen to optimize both the reaction rate and the stability of the enzyme catalyst activity. The temperature of the reaction may range from just above the freezing point of the reaction mixture (ca. 0° C.) to 70° C., with a preferred range of reaction temperature of from 5° C. to 45° C. Reactions using the enzyme catalyst may be run unbuffered in water, or in an aqueous reaction mixture containing a buffer (e.g., sodium or potassium phosphate), where the initial pH of the reaction is between 5.0 and 10.0, and preferably between 6.0 and 8.0. As the reaction proceeds, the pH of the reaction mixture may change due to the formation of an ammonium salt of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid by the hydrolysis of the nitrile functionality of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile. The reaction can be run to complete conversion of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile with no pH control, or in the presence of added buffer to control pH, or a suitable acid or base can be added over the course of the reaction to maintain the desired pH. 
 The (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid obtained by reaction of a mixture of (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile with a nitrilase catalyst may be readily isolated by first separating any insoluble solid matter (including the enzyme catalyst) from the reaction mixture. (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile present in the resulting product mixture as a separate organic phase (if any) is separated from the aqueous phase containing (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (as the ammonium salt) and soluble (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile. The (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile present in the aqueous phase is then extracted with a suitable solvent selected from the group consisting of (but not limited to) toluene, heptane, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane or methyl-t-butyl ether; the ammonium salt of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid has negligible solubility in the chosen extraction solvent. The (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid product is then isolated from the aqueous phase by procedures well known to those of ordinary skill. Such procedures include but are not limited to concentration, ion exchange, distillation, electrodialysis, extraction, and crystallization. The product may be isolated as the ammonium salt or (after acidification) as the corresponding carboxylic acid. The recovered (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, free from any significant concentration of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, is then converted to (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid by procedures well known to those skilled in the art, including those methods for the conversion of nitrites to carboxylic acids disclosed in the present application. 
 Similarly, the (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid obtained by reaction of a mixture of (E,Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile with a nitrile hydratase/amidase catalyst may be readily isolated by first separating any insoluble solid matter (including the enzyme catalyst) from the reaction mixture. (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile (present in the resulting product mixture as a separate organic phase, if any) is separated from the aqueous phase containing (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (as the ammonium salt), (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenamide (to the extent there is conversion of (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, see the accompanying examples) and soluble (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile. The (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenamide present in the aqueous phase are then extracted with a suitable solvent selected from the group consisting of (but not limited to) toluene, heptane, methyl isobutyl ketone, dichloromethane or methyl-t-butyl ether; the ammonium salt of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid has negligible solubility in the chosen extraction solvent. The (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid product is then isolated from the aqueous phase by procedures well known to those of ordinary skill. Such procedures include but are not limited to concentration, ion exchange, distillation, electrodialysis, extraction, and crystallization. The product may be isolated as the ammonium salt or (after acidification) as the corresponding carboxylic acid. The recovered (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenamide (if any), free from any significant concentration of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, is then converted to (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid by procedures well known to those skilled in the art, including those methods for the conversion of nitrites or amides to carboxylic acids disclosed in the present application.

 Preparation of (E)- and (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic Acids by Enzymatic Hydrolysis of a 72:28 Mixture of (E)- and (Z)-2-Methyl-2-Butenenitriles 
 A product mixture produced according to the method described in Example 10, containing ca. 1.44 M (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid and ca. 0.56 M (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, is decanted from the immobilized cell catalyst. The resulting product mixture is comprised of an aqueous layer containing the ammonium salt of (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid and ca. 1.1 wt % (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, and a second organic layer which is solely (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile. The (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile is separated from the aqueous phase, and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with an equivalent volume of methyl-t-butyl ether to remove the remaining (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile. The pH of the aqueous phase is then adjusted to 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid extracted from the resulting aqueous mixture with methyl-t-butyl ether. The organic extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the methyl-t-butyl ether removed from the filtrate by distillation under reduced pressure to give (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid in high yield and purity; the (E)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid is further purified (if desired) by crystallization from ethyl acetate/hexanes. 
 The unreacted (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile recovered from the product mixture is mixed at 10 wt % with 6.0 N sulfuric acid and heated to 100° C. with stirring until complete conversion of (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile to (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid is achieved. The (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid is extracted from the resulting aqueous mixture with methyl-t-butyl ether. The organic extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the methyl-t-butyl ether is removed from the filtrate by distillation under reduced pressure to give (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid in high yield and purity. The (Z)-2-methyl-2-butenoic acid is further purified (if desired) by crystallization from ethyl acetate/hexanes.
