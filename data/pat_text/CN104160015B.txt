 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to the recombinant microorganism of production quinolinic acid and the method using the micro-organisms quinolinic acid. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Quinolinic acid (quinolinic acid) is also referred to as 2,3- pyridines-dicarboxylic acids, many in medicine, agricultural chemicals, dyestuff etc.
It is used for the precursor of synthetics in field. 
 Above-mentioned quinolinic acid can be prepared by chemistry or biological synthesis method.Chemical synthesis process by from oil can not
Regeneration (non-renewable) material uses as raw material, thus can by environmental problem and oil price or oil extraction unit into
This influence. 
 As the representational example of biological synthesis method, the production quinoline in following Escherichia coli (E.coli) is disclosed
The method of acid：In the Escherichia coli for eliminating quinolinic acid phosphoryl glycosyltransferase activity, there is coding L- days by clone
The plasmid of the different copy numbers of the gene of winter amino acid oxidase (NadB) and quinoline acid enzyme (NadA), makes above two gene
Expression strengthened (Eur.J.Biochem.175,221-228 (1988), DE3826041).Now, caused quinolinic acid
Concentration is 500mg/L or following extremely low level.First reason for generating the quinolinic acid of such low concentration is NadR
Transcription inhibition, it is the nadB of coding L-Aspartic acid oxidizing ferment and encodes the related to NAD of the nadA of quinoline acid enzyme
Transcription inhibition.Second reason is L-Aspartic acid oxidizing ferment caused by NAD --- the feedback inhibition of NadB protein.3rd
Individual reason is to be died down in Escherichia coli by the biosynthesis pathway of carbon source to L-Aspartic acid. 
 In order to solve first reason, in Korean patent publication No. 10-2012-008267, microbial bacteria has been used
Strain is by the output increased of quinolinic acid to 5.5g/L, wherein the quinolinic acid biosynthesis gene L- that will be suppressed in transcription stage
The promoter region of aspartate oxidase (NadB) and quinoline acid enzyme (NadA) replaces with constitutive promoter
(constitutive promoter), and enhance L-Aspartic acid Biosynthetic pathway. 
 For example following reaction scheme institute of biosynthesis pathway by biological synthesis method by L-Aspartic acid synthesis of quinoline acid
Show.

Matter, have in the cell by natural desamination reaction, be converted into characteristic (the THE JOURNAL OF of methyl-oxalacetic ester
BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,Vol.257,No.2,Issue of January 25.pp.626-632,1982).Generally,
When unstable mesostate is used as matrix, if the collision frequency between above-mentioned matrix and enzyme is not high, can give birth to
Into substantial amounts of accessory substance.But also carried out so far without to solve the above mentioned problem related to the production of quinolinic acid
Attempt. 
 On the other hand, heterologous enzyme or protein are connected by Amino acid linker, them is expressed as protein
Fusion protein technology, it is used for various purposes, such as the protein connection more than the protein and expression quantity that expression quantity is lacked, so as to
Increase above-mentioned protein expression amount, or be prepared into the fusion protein being connected with mark (Tag), so as to improve the pure of protein
Rate etc.. 
 The design of known joint is important for preparing fusion protein.Generally, it is to use the spiral shell with α-helixstructure more
Revolving has the flexible joint of flexible (flexibility) in shape joint or structure, and for example, fusion egg according to desired realization
White characteristic, can be by combining above two joint design and use various terminal (Cancer Res 2005；65:(16)
.August 15,2005)。 
 It is open 
 Technical problem 
 The present inventor attempts the fusion by expressing the NadB and NadA that are formed by connecting by different types of Amino acid linker
Albumen, reduce, and found compared with existing biological production method to solve to react as caused by unstable metabolite,
Can be to produce quinolinic acid in high yield, so as to complete the present invention by expressing the fusion protein. 
 Technical scheme
