 Although the ω that use methods described herein, table 2 are listed-3/ ω-6 PUFA most probable gathers in the oily fraction of saccharomyces olei, it is restrictive or completely that this tabulation should not be construed as. 
 All esterified fatty acids of " TL fraction " phalangeal cell of this paper term cell.The separable different subfractions that go out in the TL fraction comprise triacylglycerol [" oil "] fraction, phosphatidylcholine fraction and phosphatidylethanolamine fraction, but this do not comprise all subfractions. 
 Term " triacylglycerol " [" TAG "] and " oil " are interchangeable, and they refer to three neutral lipids that the fatty acyl residue forms by the acidylate glycerol molecule.TAG can comprise long-chain PUFA, and short saturated and undersaturated lipid acid and than the saturated fatty acid of long-chain.The TAG fraction of cell is also referred to as " oily fraction ", and " biosynthesizing of oil " refers generally to synthetic TAG in cell.Oil or TAG fraction are the subfractions of TL fraction, although it also is the major portion that consists of total lipid content, total lipid content represents with the per-cent that the total fatty acids weight in the oil-containing biomass cells accounts for stem cell weight [vide infra].Fatty acid composition in oil [" TAG "] fraction and the fatty acid composition of TL fraction generally are similar.Therefore, the raising of the PUFA concentration in the TL fraction or reduction will be corresponding to rising or the reductions of the PUFA concentration in oil [" TAG "] fraction, and vice versa. 
 Term " total fatty acids " [" TFA "] this paper refers to the total amount of all cells lipid acid, described lipid acid can change into fatty acid methyl ester [" FAME "] by alkali ester exchange method (methods known in the art) is derived in given example, for example it can be TL fraction or oily fraction.Therefore; total fatty acids comprises the lipid acid from neutral and polar lipid fraction; comprise phosphatidylcholine fraction, phosphatidylethanolamine fraction (phosphatidyletanolamine fraction) and DG, monoacylglycerol and triacylglycerol [" TAG or oil "] fraction, but do not comprise free fatty acids. 
 " total lipid content " of term cell is measuring of TFA, represents with the form of stem cell weight [" DCW "] per-cent.Therefore, total lipid content [" TFA%DCW "] is equal to for example total fatty acids milligram number of per 100 milligrams of DCW. 
 Fatty acid concentration this paper generally is expressed as the weight percent [" %TFA "] of TFA, for example the given lipid acid milligram number of per 100 milligrams of TFA.Unless specify in addition in this paper disclosure, given lipid acid is equal to the fatty acid concentration that represents with %TFA with respect to the per-cent of TL, and for example the %DHA of TL is equal to DHA%TFA. 
 In some cases, can use given lipid acid in the cell to account for the content of per-cent [" %DCW "] the given lipid acid of formal representation of stem cell weight.Therefore for example docosahexenoic acid %DCW will measure according to following formula: (docosahexenoic acid %TFA) * (TFA%DCW)]/100. 
 Term " lipid profile " and " lipid composition " are interchangeable, and the single amount of planting lipid acid that refers to comprise in specific lipid fraction (for example in TL fraction or oil [" TAG "] fraction), and wherein said amount represents with TFA per-cent form.The total amount of the various lipid acid that exist in the mixture should be 100. 
 Pathways metabolism or biosynthetic pathway can be thought to betide in the cell by enzymatic series of chemical on Biochemical Significance, with the formation of realization cell meta-bolites to be used or to be stored, or start the pathways metabolism that another is called " flow generation step ".A lot of these classpaths are all very meticulous, and relate to the product of progressively modifying to make it to form the precise chemical structure structure with expectation to initial substance. 
 Term " PUFA biosynthetic pathway " refers to oleic acid is changed into ω-6 lipid acid such as LA, EDA, GLA, DGLA, ARA, DRA, DTA and DPAn-6 and the metabolic process of the omega-fatty acid such as ALA, STA, ETrA, ETA, EPA, DPA and DHA.Describe this process in the document in detail.Referring to for example international application published WO2006/052870.In brief, this process relates to by adding carbon atom and prolongs carbochain and make the molecule desaturation by adding two keys, and this is by being present in a series of specificity desaturases in the endoplasmic reticulum and extending enzyme (being called " PUFA biosynthetic pathway enzyme ") and carry out.More particularly, " PUFA biosynthetic pathway enzyme " refers to the following any enzyme (and gene of encode this enzyme) relevant with the PUFA biosynthesizing, comprising: Δ 9 extends enzyme, C
         14/16 Extend enzyme, C
         16/18 Extend enzyme, C
         18/20 Extend enzyme, C

 When term " ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway " refers under conditions suitable to express coding catalysis ω-3 and ω-6 lipid acid the two one of or one group of gene of both enzymes of producing.Usually, participate in the genes encoding PUFA biosynthetic pathway enzyme of ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.Fig. 1 shows a representative approach, and the conversion from the multiple intermediate product of tetradecanoic acid process to DHA is provided, and having demonstrated ω-3 and ω-6 lipid acid is how can produce from common source.This approach is divided into two portions naturally, and another part only generates ω-6 lipid acid so that a part only generates omega-fatty acid.The part that only produces omega-fatty acid will be called the omega-3 fatty acid biological route of synthesis in this article, and the part that only produces ω-6 lipid acid is called ω-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in this article. 
 As used about ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway herein, term " functional " refers to some (or all) the activity of gene expression enzymes in this approach, causes catalysis or substrate conversion in the body.Be to be understood that, " ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway " or " functional ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway " also do not mean that all genes of listing in the top paragraph all are essential, because many fatty acids products will only need to express the subgroup gene in this approach. 
 Term "  ω  6 desaturases/ ω  6 extends enzymatic pathway " will refer to that minimum level comprises at least a  ω  6 desaturases and at least a C
         18/20 Extend the PUFA biosynthetic pathway of enzyme, thereby so that can respectively from LA and ALA, come biosynthesizing DGLA and/or ETA with GLA and/or STA as the lipid acid intermediate product.When expressing other desaturases and extending enzyme, also can synthesize ARA, DTA, DPAn-6, EPA, DPA and DHA.
       
 Term " Δ 9 extends enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach " refers to that minimum level comprises that at least a Δ 9 extends the PUFA biosynthetic pathway of enzyme and at least a Δ 8 desaturases, thereby so that can respectively from LA and ALA, come biosynthesizing DGLA and/or ETA with EDA and/or ETrA as the lipid acid intermediate product.When expressing other desaturases and extending enzyme, also can synthesize ARA, DTA, DPAn-6, EPA, DPA and DHA. 
 The term " fatty acid " intermediate product " refer to any lipid acid of in the fatty acid metabolism approach, producing, it can further transform by the effect of other pathways metabolism enzymes the purpose fatty acids products of cost approach.For example, when utilizing Δ 9 to extend enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach generation EPA, these lipid acid can produce EDA, ETrA, DGLA, ETA and ARA and be considered to " lipid acid intermediate product ", because can further change into EPA by the effect of other pathways metabolism enzymes. 
 Term " desaturase " refers to polypeptide, thereby it can remove by from adjoining carbons hydrogen atom and import two keys between the carbon atom with the adjoining carbons desaturation in lipid acid.Desaturation has produced lipid acid or concerned precursor.Although in whole specification sheets, refer to specific lipid acid with the ω-system of referring to, count to represent the active more convenient of desaturase with Δ-system from the carboxyl terminal of substrate.What this paper especially paid close attention to is Δ 4 desaturases, and its catalytic substrate lipid acid DPA changes into DHA and/or catalytic substrate lipid acid DTA changes into DPAn-6.Other desaturases comprise: 1) Δ 17 desaturases, it is being numbered desaturation lipid acid between the 17th and the 18th the carbon atom from the molecule C-terminal, and it for example catalytic substrate lipid acid ARA changes into EPA and/or catalytic substrate lipid acid DGLA changes into ETA; 2) Δ 6 desaturases, its catalysis lipid acid substrate LA change into GLA and/or catalysis lipid acid substrate A LA changes into STA; 3) Δ 12 desaturases, its catalytic substrate lipid acid oleic acid changes into LA; 4) Δ 15 desaturases, its catalysis lipid acid substrate LA change into ALA and/or catalysis lipid acid substrate GLA changes into STA; 5) Δ 5 desaturases, its catalysis lipid acid substrate DGLA change into ARA and/or catalysis lipid acid substrate ETA changes into EPA; 6) Δ 8 desaturases, its catalysis lipid acid substrate EDA change into DGLA and/or catalysis lipid acid substrate ETrA changes into ETA; With 7) Δ 9 desaturases, its catalytic substrate lipid acid palmitinic acid changes into Zoomeric acid (16:1) and/or catalytic substrate lipid acid stearic acid changes into oleic acid.In the art, based on Δ 15 and D17 desaturase ω-6 lipid acid is changed into the ability (as respectively LA being changed into ALA and ARA being changed into EPA) of their ω-3 counterpart, also they are called once in a while " ω-3 desaturase ", " ω-3 desaturase " and/or " ω-3 desaturase ".Desired is to transform appropriate host and measure it to the effect of this host's fatty acid distribution by the gene with fatty acid desaturase, thereby measures the specificity of special fatty acid desaturase empirically. 
 Term " E1594D4 " refers to  Δ  4 desaturases (SEQ ID NO:2), and it belongs to cf_gymnastica CCMP1594 from small-sized green alga and separates and to obtain, by the SEQ ID NO:1 coding of this paper.Similarly, term " E1594D4S " refers to  synthetic Δ  4 desaturases, and this enzyme source belongs to cf_gymnastica CCMP1594 in small-sized green alga, its through the codon optimization in Yarrowia lipolytica, to express (being SEQ ID NO:3 and 4). 
 Term " transformation efficiency " refers to that with " substrate conversion per-cent " certain enzyme (such as desaturase) can become substrate conversion the efficient of product.Transformation efficiency is measured according to following formula: ([product]/[substrate+product]) * 100, wherein ' product ' comprises all products that derive from it in intermediate product and this approach.

 Summary: the microorganism biological of lipid acid and triacylglycerol is synthetic 
 
 Usually, the accumulation of lipid of oil-containing microorganism is that response is present in the total carbon-nitrogen ratio in the growth medium and triggers.This process (de novo synthesis that causes in the oil-containing microorganism free palmitinic acid (16:0)) is at United States Patent (USP) 7,238, has a detailed description in 482.Palmitinic acid be long-chain saturated with precursor unsaturated fatty acid derivative, these derivative of fatty acid form (Fig. 1) by the effect of extending enzyme and desaturase. 
 TAG (the main storage unit of lipid acid) forms by the series reaction that relates to following reaction: acyl-CoA and the glycerol-3-phosphate of (1) a part generate Ultrapole L by the acyltransferase esterification; (2) dimolecular acyl-CoAs generate 1 by the acyltransferase esterification, 2-DG phosphoric acid (being commonly referred to phosphatidic acid); 3) remove phosphoric acid to generate 1,2-DG [" DAG "] by phosphatidic acid phosphatase; With 4) effect by acyltransferase adds tri-fatty to form TAG.The lipid acid of wide spectrum can be integrated among the TAG, comprises saturated and lipid acid undersaturated lipid acid and short chain and long-chain. 
 
 The biosynthesizing of omega-3 fatty acid 
 
 Wherein the oleic acid metabolic process that changes into ω-3/ ω-6 lipid acid comprises by adding carbon atom and carbochain is prolonged and makes the molecule desaturation by adding two keys.This need to be present in a series of special desaturase in the endoplasmic reticulum and extend enzyme.Yet, as in Fig. 1, see with as described below, usually have a plurality of alternative route for generation of specific ω-3/ ω-6 lipid acid. 
 Specifically, Fig. 1 has described approach hereinafter described.All approach all need by Δ 12 desaturases oleic acid to be changed into linolic acid [" LA "] (the first ω-6 lipid acid) at first.Then, utilize " Δ 9 extends enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach " and LA is used as the following formation long-chain omega-6 of substrate and omega-fatty acid: 1) extend enzymes by Δ 9 LA is changed into eicosadienoic acid [" EDA "]; 2) by Δ 8 desaturases EDA is changed into dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid [" DGLA "]; 3) by Δ 5 desaturases DGLA is changed into arachidonic acid [" ARA "]; 4) pass through C
         20/22 Extend enzyme ARA is changed into docosatetratenoic acid [" DTA "]; With 5) by Δ 4 desaturases DTA is changed into clupanodonic acid [" DPAn-6 "].Alternatively, " Δ 9 extends enzyme/Δ 8 desaturase approach " can make substrate production long-chain omega-fatty acid by following use alpha-linolenic acid [" ALA "]: 1) by Δ 15 desaturases LA is changed into ALA (first omega-fatty acid); 2) extend enzyme by Δ 9 ALA is changed into eicosatrienoic acid [" ETrA "]; 3) by Δ 8 desaturases ETrA is changed into eicosatetraenoic acid [" ETA "]; 4) by Δ 5 desaturases ETA is changed into timnodonic acid [" EPA "]; 5) pass through C
         20/22 Extend enzyme EPA is changed into clupanodonic acid [" DPA "]; With 6) by Δ 4 desaturases DPA is changed into docosahexenoic acid [" DHA "].Randomly, ω-6 lipid acid can change into omega-fatty acid; For example, ETA and EPA generate from DGLA and ARA respectively by Δ 17 desaturase activity.
       
 The biosynthesizing alternative route of ω-3/ ω-6 lipid acid is utilized  Δ  6 desaturases and C
         18/20 Extend enzyme, that is, and "  Δ  6 desaturases/ Δ  6 extends enzymatic pathway ".More particularly, LA and ALA can be changed into respectively gamma-linolenic acid [" GLA "] and therapic acid [" STA "] by  Δ  6 desaturases.Then, C
         18/20 Extending enzyme changes into GLA DGLA and/or STA is changed into ETA.Form as mentioned above subsequently downstream PUFA.
       
 Expection need to be expressed in the specific host biology in order to the specific function that produces ω-3/ ω-6 lipid acid will depend on host cell (and natural PFUA overview and/or desaturase/extension enzyme overview), the utilizability of substrate and required end product.Those skilled in the art can identify the candidate gene of every kind of enzyme that Multi-encoding ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid biological is synthetic required.Available desaturase and extend enzyme sequence and can be derived from any source for example, separates from natural origin such as bacterium, algae, fungi, oomycetes, yeast, primary phycomycete, plant, animal etc., produces or de novo synthesis via semi-synthetic approach.Although it is not crucial importing host's desaturase and the concrete source of elongase gene, the consideration item that selection has the specific polypeptide of desaturase or elongase activity comprises: 1) substrate specificity of polypeptide and activity; 2) whether polypeptide or its assembly are rate-limiting enzyme; 3) whether the synthetic PUFA that expects is necessary for desaturase or extension enzyme; 4) the required cofactor of polypeptide; And/or 5) whether polypeptide is modified after it produces, and for example, modifies by kinases or prenyltransferase.The polypeptide of expressing preferably has the parameter with the biochemical environmentally compatible of its position in host cell.Referring to United States Patent (USP) 7,238,482. 
 The transformation efficiency of considering every kind of specific desaturase and/or extension enzyme also can be useful.More particularly, because every kind of enzyme seldom can become product with substrate conversion with 100% efficient, the mixture of the multiple PUFA that the final lipid profile of the unpurified oil that produces in the host cell normally is comprised of ω-3/ ω-6 lipid acid and the multiple upstream PUFA intermediate product of expectation.Therefore, when the biosynthesizing optimization of the lipid acid that makes expectation, the transformation efficiency of every kind of enzyme also is the variable that will consider. 
 Consider above-mentioned each consideration item, have suitable desaturase and elongase activity (such as  Δ  6 desaturases, C

 Expression system, expression cassette and carrier 
 
 Gene described herein and gene product can be at the heterologous host cells.Expression in recombinant host can be used for producing multiple PUFA approach intermediate product, perhaps can be used for regulating the PUFA approach that has existed among the host, in order to the synthetic new product that can not synthesize with this host up to now. 
 The expression system and the expression vector that contain the regulating and controlling sequence of guiding extraneous protein high level expression are known.Any of these expression systems and expression vector all can be used for making up the mosaic gene for generation of any gene product of sequence of the present invention.Then can be with these mosaic genes by transform importing in the appropriate host cell to provide the high level expression of coded enzyme. 
 The carrier (such as construct, plasmid) and the DNA expression cassette that can be used for transforming the appropriate host cell are to know.The character of required expression product (the same), host cell and the means with respect to no transformed cells separation transformant of proposition are depended in the concrete selection that is present in the sequence in the construct.Yet carrier contains the sequence of at least one expression cassette, selective marker and permission self-replicating or chromosomal integration usually.Suitable expression cassette comprises that the  dna fragmentation  3 that 5 of Gene Handling transcription initiation ' district is promotor, gene coded sequence and control Transcription Termination ' district is terminator.Most preferably, these two control regions all derive from the gene from the host cell that transforms, and needn't be derived from the natural gene that is elected to be the specific species of producing the host although should understand this control region. 
 Transcripting controling area or be used for to drive promotor that Δ 4 desaturase ORF express at the expectation host cell and have multiplely and is known.These control regions can comprise promotor, enhanser, the son of mourning in silence, intron sequences, 3 ' UTR and/or 5 ' UTR zone and albumen and/or RNA stable element.The length of this class component can be different with specificity.Any promotor (being natural, synthetic or chimeric promotor) that in fact can guide these genes to express in selected host cell all is suitable for, but is particularly useful from the district that transcribes and translate of host species.Expression in host cell can occur in the mode of induction type or composing type.Inducible expression occurs by the activity of inducing the regulation type promotor that may be operably coupled to the gene of paying close attention to, and constitutive expression occurs by the constitutive promoter that utilization may be operably coupled to the gene of paying close attention to. 
 When host cell is for example during yeast, functional the transcribing with translational domain in the yeast cell especially provides from host's bacterial classification.The preferred transcription initiation regulatory region that is used for using at Yarrowia lipolytica is referring to international application published WO 2006/052870.Can use any one of many regulating and controlling sequences, this depends on, and the expectation composing type is transcribed or induction type is transcribed, the efficient of promotor in expressing the ORF that pays close attention to, the easiness of structure etc. 
 3 ' non-coding sequence of encoding transcription termination signal must be provided in recombinant precursor, that is, " terminator ", this sequence can be from the gene that therefrom obtains original area or heterogeneic 3 ' zone.A large amount of terminators is known and when the genus that is used for being derived from from them genus identical and different with species and species, its function of bringing into play in multiple host is satisfactory.The selection of terminator is usually mostly to be for convenient rather than because any special character.Stop the control region and also can come from the natural several genes of preferred host.3 '-district also can synthesize because those skilled in the art can utilize obtainable information to design and synthesize be used as 3 of transcription terminator '-region sequence.The terminator can be nonessential, but is highly preferred. 
 Only a gene such as delta 8 desaturase genes insertion cloning vector are not guaranteed the expression such as its speed with expectation, concentration, amount.According to the needs to the high expression level rate, many controls are transcribed by operating, rna stability, translation, protein stability and position, oxygen restriction and different genetic elements from secretory host cell, have set up the expression vector of many special uses.Some are handled feature and comprise: the character of associated retroviral promotor and terminator sequence, the copy number of clone gene (wherein can by increasing plasmid copy number or clone gene repeatedly being incorporated in the copy importing host cell that the copy that will add in the genome clone in single expression construct and/or will add), gene is that plasmid infects or is incorporated in the host cell gene group, the final cell position of synthetic foreign protein, the translation efficiency of albumen in host living beings and correct folding, the mRNA of clone gene and the albumen internal stability in host cell, and the codon in clone gene use so that its frequency near the preferred codon usage frequency in the host cell.In these features each can be used for method as herein described and host cell with the expression of  further optimization Δ  4 desaturases.
