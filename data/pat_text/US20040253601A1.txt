     This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Section 119 to Korean Patent Applications 2003-0037511, filed Jun. 11, 2003; and 2003-0041051, filed Jun. 24, 2003.  [0001]    
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0002]
     The present invention is directed to recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (rhMBL), vectors and transformants for the production of recombinant MBL (rhMBL), use of rhMBL for prophylaxis and treatment of infection and/or immunedeficiency.  [0002]    
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0003]
     MBL is a serum protein involved in innate immunity. The molecular weight is 32 KD, consisting of carboxy-terminal carbohydrate binding domain (CRD), collagen domain, and amino-terminal cysteine-rich region. The collagen domains of three MBL molecules form a triple helix resulting in a formation of a trimer, and then up to six units of the trimers form a giant molecule by inter molecular disulfide bonding using amino-terminal cysteines.  [0003]    
     
    
    [0004]
     The MBL is associated with other proteins such as MBL associated serine proteases ( [0004]    MASP  1,  MASP  2, or MASP 3) or MBL associated protein (Map19). Therefore, the overall molecular shape of MBL is similar to the first component of complement system (C1q). The function of activated MBL is also similar to C1q, but unlike C1q it activates complement system by cleaving C4 and C2. Activation of MBL requires binding of microorganisms with unique glycosylation pattern on their surface proteins. In this process the MBL associated serine protease is activated, and C4 and C2 are cleaved in a similar way that C1q associated serine proteases (C1r and C1s) triggers activation of complement system by cleaving C3. MBL binding to microorganism also prepares the microorganism for efficient phagocytosis, as if it is an opsonins.  
     
    
    [0005]
     Previously MBL gene has been expressed in various cell lines, including CHO cell (Katsuki Ohtani et al, J. of Inmunol. Methods 222, 135-144, 1999) or HLF hepatoma cell line or HEK 293 EBNA cell (T. Vorup-Jensen et al, International Immunopharmacology 1, 677-687, 2001).  [0005]    
     
    
    [0006]
     High yield expression was possible in a CHO cell, but the MBL recovered was mainly monomers and dimers without significant amount of oligomers. Expression of MBL gene in transformed human cell lines produced significantly more oligomers, but the over all production yield was less than 1 ug/mL culture media.  [0006]    
     
    
    [0007]
     It is well known that only high molecular weight form of MBL complex is capable of activating complement system. Activation of complement system is very important in defense against microbial infection. It not only prepares for invading microorganism for efficient phagocytosis and direct lysis, but also it helps efficient induction of adaptive immunity.  [0007]    
     
    
    [0008]
     Serum level of MBL varies widely in different individuals, ranging from 50 ng/mL or lower to over 3 ug/mL serum mainly due to genetic variation. Genetic variation includes point mutations on exons and mutations on promoter regions. Generally individuals with low level of MBL are susceptible from microbial infection. Specially, those newborn children with low level of MBL are dangerously susceptible from infections. According to one survey (Y. Hakozaki et al, Liver, 22, 29-34, 2002), the mortality of patients going through hepatic failure due to Hepatitis B virus infection depended on the serum level of MBL. Patients with high level of MBL (3 ug/mL) did not die, whereas 80% of the patients with low MBL level died. Therefore those individuals with low MBL level might benefit from MBL supplement.  [0008]    
     
    
    [0009]
     Therapeutic use of recombinant MBL requires not only high level expression of MBL for industrial quantity production but also high molecular oligomeric form of MBL.  [0009]    
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0010]
     We have successfully established recombinant CHO cell line that produces not only high amount of MBL (100 ug/mL culture media) but also significant amount of oligomeric form of MBL. This invention provides a recombinant CHO cell line producing high molecular weight, oligomeric form of rhMBL for a large scale production to be used for industrial product development.  [0010]    
     
    
    [0011]
     Further, this invention provides a new method for purification of rhMBL from the CHO cell culture media by using recombinant pre S protein as an affinity ligand. Further, this invention provides a convenient new method for determination of MBL activity by using recombinant pre S.  [0011]    
     
    
    [0012]
     Further, this invention provides new formulations of MBL and methods of using them as triggers for complement activation. These formulations and methods provided are for treatment of acute patients with systemic infection by microorganisms. [0012]

    [0028]
     The present invention involves the discovery of a new oligomeric form of rhMBL, which, in a therapeutic context, is intended to trigger the complement system for the treatment of systemic infection with virus, bacteria, or fungus. For this purpose recombinant MBL has been produced from a uniquely constructed recombinant CHO cell line and formulated to fulfill the therapeutic purpose. General techniques for recombinant protein production can be found in Mammalian Cell Biotechnology in Protein Production, eds. Hansjorg Hauser et al, 1997, Walter de Gruyter, Inc.  [0028]    
     
    
    [0029]
     As described below in detail, in this invention the MBL gene-transformed cell line was a host cell transformed with pMSG-MBL. pMSG-MBL was constructed from pMGS (Korean patent, KCCM 10202, hereby incorporated by reference), having a DNA sequence consisting of nuclear matrix attachment region element of beta-globin gene sequence, SV40 poly A, and transcription termination sequence of gastrin gene and MBL cDNA. The MBL cDNA was prepared from a human liver cDNA library by PCR method. The host cell line is an animal cell, preferably Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell, human hepatocytes, and/or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell. Other host animal cell lines are familiar to those of skill in the art, and find use in this invention  [0029]    
     
    
    [0030]
     In this invention as a non-limiting example, CHO cell was transformed with pMSG-MBL, and high expression clones were selected in the presence of increasing amount of methotrexate (MTX). The selected best clone was named CHO MBL/D1-3.  [0030]    
     
    
    [0031]
     MBL produced from the CHO cell line showed high molecular weight multimeric forms, resembling natural MBL purified from human serum. This invention presents ways to produce high molecular weight, multimeric form of MBL. Further the CHO cell line produced a large quantity of functional MBL, making it possible to use the clone for industrial quantity of MBL production.  [0031]    
     
    
    [0032]
     This invention presents a convenient method for purification of MBL from CHO MBL/D1-3 culture media, using recombinant pre S as an affinity ligand. For example, first pre S was immobilized on an appropriate column matrix, next packed onto a column, after this the column was equilibrated with an appropriate buffer. Finally, the culture media with MBL was loaded on to the column in the presence of calcium ion, eluting out MBL with a buffer containing EDTA or EGTA.  [0032]    
     
    
    [0033]
     The column matrix can be any such matrix as sepharose.  [0033]    
     
    
    [0034]
     In other work, we constructed a recombinant yeast cell line that produced pre S portion of Hepatitis B virus envelope protein (International Publication No. WO 02/094866, herein incorporated by reference.)  [0034]    
     
    
    [0035]
     Purified recombinant pre S from this cell is highly glycosylated, and bound with MBL, and activated MBL for complement activation in the presence of MBL free serum as a source of MASPs. Consequently pre S was a very useful tool for convenient assay of MBL for functional activity. Further, the pre S can be used as a mean for purification of MBL from serum as well as from other sources such as recombinant MBL production.  [0035]    
     
    
    [0036]
     Recombinant pre S was also used in a specific formulation of MBL for a direct trigger for complement activation. We prepared a PLGA [Poly(D,L lactic-co-glycolic acid)]-particle coated with pre S, which bound with MBL and activated complement in the presence of MBL free serum. According to our finding pre S in a solution made neither stable complex with MBL, nor did it activate MBL for complement activation.  [0036]    
     
    
    [0037]
     Equilibration of the column was accomplished by using a buffer that afforded best binding of MBL to pre S. This buffer contained calcium ion in the range of 2 mM to 20 mM. The source of MBL to be purified can be human serum or any other material containing MBL such as culture media of CHO MBL/D1-3.  [0037]    
     
    
    [0038]
     Elution of MBL from the column can be done with any solution containing EDTA or EGTA in the concentration range of 5 mM to 10 mM. If necessary this affinity column step can be repeated.  [0038]    
     
    
    [0039]
     This purified MBL finds use in formulation of therapeutic agents. Methods for formulating MBL in a pharmaceutical delivery vehicle for administration to subjects for prophylaxis and treatment of infection are known (NatImmune A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). This can be a formulation for individuals with no or low level serum MBL to strengthen defensive measure against microbial infection. Further MBL can be used as a formulation of active therapeutic agent for patients with systemic infection, by administering a much higher dose of MBL than normal serum level of MBL. This formulation can be MBL so formulated as a direct trigger for complement activation to treat patients with systemic infection of microorganism.  [0039]    
     
    
    [0040]
     Pharmaceutical delivery vehicle formulations can include water, buffer solution, and/or stabilizers. Stabilizers include glycerol, glucose, sucrose, sorbitol, trehalose, maltose, albumin, and amino acids such as lysine or glycine. The amount of one or combination of these can be 3% to 30%.

    [0041]
     Formulation of MBL can include MBL associated proteins such as  [0041]    MASP  1,  MASP  2,  MASP  3, and/or Map19. These MBL associated proteins can be from natural sources or recombinant proteins.  
     
    
    [0042]
     Formulation of an effective amount of MBL can be in the form of oil suspension, solution, or solid. In case of solid it can be dissolved in a solution mentioned above before administration.  [0042]    
     
    
    [0043]
     The route of administration of MBL can be ip, sc, im or iv injection or a combination.  [0043]    
     
    
    [0044]
     This invention provides method of making MBL for use as a composition which comprises a pharmaceutical delivery vehicle which is administered to a human subject in need of it as a trigger for complement activation. An embodiment of the invention is a preparation which uses pre S coated on the surface of liposome or PLGA nano-particle.  [0044]    
     
    
    [0045]
     The term nanoparticles includes particles which are hollow as well as filled particles. Methods for making nanoparticles (5 to 500 mn), either uniform in size or having a predefined complex size distribution, from biocompatible, biodegradable polymers are well known. The sphere-shaped particles can be formed from a variety of materials, including FDA-approved, biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyanhydrides.

    [0046]
     The size of nanoparticle ranges from 5 nm to 500 nm. The pre S can be replaced with any glycosylated protein or peptide or glycosyl moeity, e.g. mannose, that binds with MBL. Examples of glycosyl moieties include, but are not restricted to of mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine-rich oligosaccharides present on a wide range of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, glucans, and lipophosphoglycans and glycoinositol-phospholipids with mannose, glucose, fucose, or N-acetylglucosamine as N-terminal hexoses. Glycoproteins useful in the invention pre S glycosylated viral envelope protein, glycosylated bacterial protein, glycosylated fungal protein, i.e. and any artificially glycosylated protein which binds with MBL.  [0046]    
     
    
    [0047]
     Free monomeric ligand such as pre S in solution does not activate MASPs. Whereas, pre S molecules immobilized onto solid surface make stable complex with MBL and activate MBL and complement system. Therefore our finding indicates that MBL complex activation is similar to C1 activation in that the activation of C1 complex requires engagement of multiple IgGs bound to cell surface antigens, but not with monomeric IgG molecule. Pre S conjugated onto the surface of PLGA nano-particle serves as an efficient activator of MBL complex.  [0047]    
     
    
    [0048]
     This unique formulation of MBL as a trigger for complement activation can be broadly utilized for the treatment of patients with systemic infection by microorganism such as virus, bacteria, and/or fungus.  [0048]

     MBL cDNA was prepared by PCR method using a human liver cDNA library, and it was cloned into pEZ vector (RNA, Inc. Suwon, Korea), pEZ-MBL2-5. The nucleotide sequence was verified from sequence stored in Gene Bank (Gene Bank NM [0050]    — 000242). Using this pEZ-MBL2-5 DNA as a template, 750 bp MBL cDNA for MBL expression was prepared by PCR method with  primer  1 and primer2 (see the sequence listing). These primers include Kozak Sequence and restriction endonuclease sites for cloning. This cDNA was cloned into pMSG vector (PanGen Biotech Inc., Suwon, Korea; Korean Patent, KCCM 10202) to make pMSG-MBL. The MBL sequence was verified again with Gene Bank sequence.

     A mixture containing 2 ug of pMSG-MBL DNA, 5.3 uL Dosper™, and 16 ng pDCHIP (Plasmid with DHFR gene, Venolia et al, 1987, Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 13, 491-501) was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Then the mixture was added to the host cell and incubated 6 hr. at 37 degree centigrade. After the incubation, media was removed and added 3 mL of fresh alpha-MEM containing cFBS. Then after 2-3 days when the transformed cells expanded enough, cells were harvested by trypsin treatment and 4×10 [0057]    5  cell/well was grown in 2 mL of alpha-MEM without nucleosides containing 10% dialyzed FBS. Transformed cells were grown for about 10 days with media changes every 2-3 days.

     1.3 Selection of MBL-producing Cell and Amplification of MBL Gene  [0058]    
     
    
    [0059]
     Transduced MBL gene in the transformed cell was amplified by adding gradually increasing amount of MTX in the culture media. For this, cell number was adjusted to 4×10 [0059]    5 /well and cultured in the presence of 10 nM MTX until the cells reached confluent state. By a similar method, the concentration of MTX was increased to 1 uM. In each step the level of MBL expression was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-MBL. The level of MBL was increased as the concentration of MTX was increased, and a single clone was selected from the cell adapted to 1 uM MTX.

     1.4 Selection of a Single Best Cell (Cloning)  [0060]    
     
    
    [0061]
     For single cell cloning, 1 uM MTX adapted cells were distributed into a 96-well plate at 0.5 cell/well. This plate was cultured in alpha-MEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 1 uM MTX. About two weeks later when a single cell colony was formed, the cells were transferred to 24-well plate. When cells were expanded enough, cells were frozen after analyzing the expression level. One of the cell lines selected was CHO MBL/D1-3. FIG. 1 shows the pattern of Western blot analysis of MBL produced from the recombinant cell line after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions.

     1.5 Estimation of MBL Expression Level  [0062]    
     
    
    [0063]
     Using CHO MBL/D1-3 cell line, the level of MBL expression was estimated by comparing to a known amount of purified MBL from human serum. 5×10 [0063]    5  cells were grown in a T25 flask with alpha-MEM without nucleosides containing 10% dialyzed FBS. When cell density reached 90% confluency, the media was replaced with 3 mL of the same media containing 5% dialyzed FBS. After 4 days the culture media was diluted 10 fold and the amount of MBL in the media was estimated to be 50 ug/10 6  cells/day.

     2.1 Preparation of Pre S-Sepharose Column  [0064]    
     
    
    [0065]
     One gram of CNBr activated Sepharose 4B was suspended in 1 mM HCl solution and washed several times with the same solution. To this washed Sepharose 6.4 mg pre S (recombinant pre S from Yeast, patent; PCT/KR02/00820, hereby incorporated by reference) was mixed in a coupling buffer pH 8.3 containing 0.2 M NaHCO3 and 0.5 M NaCl to make final concentration of pre S to be 0.5-10 mg/mL. After incubating 2 hr at room temperature, blocking buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M tris was added and left in the room temperature for 2 hr. Then pre S-Sepharose was washed with the blocking buffer and the amount of immobilized pre S was estimated by Western blot analysis.  [0065]

     2.2 Purification of MBL by Using Pre S-Sepharose Column  [0066]    
     
    
    [0067]
     We have established a purification method by exploiting the nature of pre S binding to MBL. Pre S can be produced in large quantity from our recombinant yeast, which produces a large quantity of pre S in culture media. Pre S-Sepharose was packed into a column and equilibrated with MBL binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.05 [0067]    % Tween  20. The column was loaded with MBL in the CHO cell culture media or in serum and washed extensively with the loading buffer. Then the MBL was eluted from the column with elution buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.05 % Tween  20. In this manner, just one step yielded 99.9% pure MBL. See FIG. 1.

 Verification of Function of rhMBL  
   
    
    [0068]
     Biological activity of rhMBL was determined for two different functions; 1) specific binding of rhMBL to glycosylated protein in calcium dependent manner and 2) activation of complement (C4 cleavage) in the presence of glycosylated protein and MASPs.  [0068]

     3.1.1 Mannan Binding  [0070]    
     
    
    [0071]
     So as to coat the plate with mannan, mannan solution in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer was added to each well to make 1 ug/well on a Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplate and incubated overnight at 4 degrees centigrade. It was washed 4 times with washing buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween-20 and treated with 0.2% BSA for 1 hr. After washing the  [0071]    plate  3 times with the washing buffer, 1 ug MBL/well was added in 100 uL of binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 1M NaCl, 10 mM CaC12, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20. After 2 hr incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed 6 times with the washing buffer and color was developed. First the plate was incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-human MBL (Dobeel, MBL8F6, 1:100 dilution) for 2 hr at room temperature. Next added was anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:1500 dilution) and incubated 1 hr at room temperature. Finally color was developed by OPD (Sigma, USA). The color development was stopped by adding 3M HCl and the color was measured at 492 nm using an automatic ELISA plate reader. Mannan binding activity of rhMBL was compared with native MBL (FIG. 2). This experiment showed rhMBL was functionally similar to native MBL purified from human serum.

     3.2.1 Complement Activation with Mannan Coated Plate  [0075]    
     
    
    [0076]
     Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplate wells were coated with 1 ug/well mannan as described in 3.1.1, and this plate was incubated 2 hr at room temperature with rhMBL or serum MBL. When rhMBL was used the MBL free serum was added as a source of MASPs. After 2 hr incubation, the plate was washed 6 times with the wash buffer and incubated 2 hr at room temperature with 500 ng/well C4. Then it was incubated 1 hr at room temperature with anti C4 antibody-HRP and color was developed by adding 150 uL OPD. After 20 min. the color reaction was stopped by adding 50 uL/well 3M HCl and OD was determined at 492 nm. This experiment showed that rhMBL had comparable activity in terms of C4 cleavage to serum MBL (Data not presented).  [0076]

     3.2.2 Complement Activation with Pre S Coated Plate  [0077]    
     
    
    [0078]
     Similarly to 3.2.1 with pre S coated (1 ug/well) plate, MBL activity for complement activation was determined. The result showed that pre S was better than mannan in the activation of MBL associated serine protease (FIG. 4).  [0078]

     Poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) [PLGA], molecular weight ranging from 1,000 to 100,000, was dissolved in an organic solvent such as methanol or methylene chloride. It was then dispersed on a solution of SDS or Tween and kept overnight with violent stirring. Nanoparticles were recovered from this.  [0081]

    [0083]
     Poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG] with heterofunctional reaction groups (X-PEG-Y) was used. In an organic solvent or in water solution, the reaction group X was activated and then conjugated to reaction groups (—OH, —COOH) on the nanoparticle. Linkers (X—) used in this conjugation can be as shown in the following:  [0083]

    [0086]
     Conjugation of pre S can be accomplished through  [0086]    -amine on lysine and arginine or N-terminal amine. Alternatively C-terminal or -carboxylic acid can be used to make conjugation of pre S to PEG conjugated to the nanoparticle. In these free Y reaction group on PEG can be conjugated to the carboxylic acid or amine on the pre S. In this the linker (Y—) can be as following:

Pharmaceutics, 203, 193-202, 2000. The number of pre S conjugated to one PLGA particle is 100,000-300,000 pre S molecules/particle.  [0088]

     4.2 PLGA-pre S as a Functional Molecule for MBL Activation  [0089]    
     
    
    [0090]
     Binding of rhMBL to PLGA-pre S and activation of complement by rhMBL-pre S-PLGA complex were carried out by the same methods employed in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, respectively. The results are shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6. We found that MBL coated plate could not be used for complement activation presumably due to blocking the association of MASPs to immobilized MBL on to a solid surface. Therefore, we also carried out complement activation assay in a solution phase, including PLGA-pre S, MBL, MASPs, and C4. From this experiment we learned that monomeric pre S, unlike the PLGA-pre S, does not make stable complex with MBL, nor does it activate MBL-associated MASPs for complement activation (Data not presented).

 Neutralization of SARS-CoV by rhMBL  
   
    
    [0091]
     Infection of SARS-CoV on fetal rhesus kidney cell (FRhk-4) was carried out in the presence of various amount of rhMBL in the culture media. As shown in the histogram of FIG. 7 and microscopic pictures (FIGS. 8), 2.5 ug/mL rhMBL blocked the virus infection, reducing the level of virus infection to less than 15% compare to the cells without MBL. The microscopic picture showed healthy cells in the presence of 2.5 ug rhMBL/mL culture media, whereas cells infected with the virus without MBL showed dead cells and swollen cells only. Considering that the normal MBL level in human serum is about 2.5 ug/ml, MBL was blocking the SARS-CoV in the presence of physiological concentration. Methods for growing SARS-CoV and detection of the virus by RT-PCR are described in Ksiazek T. G. et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348, 20: 1953-66 and Peiris J. S. et al, Lancet 2003; 361, 9366: 1319-25.  [0091]
