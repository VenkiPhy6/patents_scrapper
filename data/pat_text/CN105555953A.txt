 Technical field 
 Present disclosure relates to ornithine decarboxylase albumen and its purposes of novel modification. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Putrescine (or Putriscine) is for the production of comprising nylon-4, the polymeric amide-4 of 6, the important source material of 6, and mainly through the hydrogenation of sym-dicyanoethane with industrial-scale production, described sym-dicyanoethane is produced from vinyl cyanide by the addition of prussic acid.Relative high temperature and pressure and use expensive catalyst system during the chemosynthesis of this compound needs non-renewable petroleum chemicals to design with multiple reactor with multi-step as raw material.In addition, because these raw materials are high toxicities and inflammable, so known chemical synthesis process is unfavorable for environment.Therefore, as the alternative of chemical production processes, need the method for producing putrescine from the carbon source being derived from reproducible biomass.Recently, a lot of concern has been subjected to by the biochemical method of eco-friendly microorganisms producing putrescine.Putrescine is at the polyamine species found in the organism of the wide spectrum of animal and plant scope from bacterium.In intestinal bacteria, the concentration of putrescine is known as extremely high, nearly about 2.8g/L.Similarly, microorganism has the potential good resistance to high density polyamines, and thus they can grow and survive under the existence of its high density.Such as, reported that corynebacterium glutamicum even can grow under the existence of cadaverine being greater than 30g/L.Therefore, carried out constantly studying can use microorganism in the production of the industrial high density polyamines obtained.But, can industrial application to using the research of microorganisms producing polyamines also enough not advanced.Therefore, need to develop bacterial strain (QianZG etc., BiotechnolBioeng, 104:651-662,2009 that can produce polyamines with high yield; SchneiderJ etc., ApplMicrobiolBiotechnol, 88:859-868,2010). 
 Meanwhile, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the enzyme found in most of microbe, and ornithine is converted into putrescine by it.ODC in intestinal bacteria forms homodimer usually, and forms avtive spot at dimer interface (dimerinterface) place.The reaction mechanism of ODC needs pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as cofactor, and PLP forms schiff bases at the lysine residue place of the avtive spot of enzyme, and it is replaced by the substrate ornithine of experience decarboxylation subsequently.When producing putrescine, ODC forms schiff bases with PLP again. 
 When ODC is introduced into product putrescine bacterial strain---corynebacterium---, it is by the protein of intestinal bacteria speC genes encoding, and its activity is reported as very low.Therefore, in order to develop the bacterial strain producing putrescine with high yield, ODC, the improvement of---it is the enzyme of the final step participating in putrescine biosynthetic pathway---is very important.So far, only mutation research has been carried out to the structure of ODC albumen or reaction mechanism, and not about its active report increased.
