Synthetic short-chain peptides are increasingly used in pharmacology and in parenteral feeding. Kyotorphin (L-Tyr 10 L-Arg), which promotes the release of enkephalins, that is to say endogenous substances which have an analgesic and tranquillizing action in the brain (Hughes, 1975), may be mentioned as an example of a pharmacologically active dipeptide. 15 The enzymatic preparation of di- or oligopeptides is already known and generally makes use of protective group technology. The use of a formyl protective group is thus described in US-A-571,037, that of an acetyl protective 20 group in JP 62074296, that of a benzyl protective group in US-A-4,935,355 or that of a phenacetyl protective group in Tetrahedron 1992, 48, 1115. These variants have the disadvantage that the protective groups in some cases are not inexpensive (benzyl, phenacetyl), can be split off 25 again only with difficulty (acetyl, formyl) or can be removed (benzyl) only under quite specific conditions (hydrogenolysis). The object of the invention was therefore to develop a 30 process for the synthesis of peptides which is particularly simple and inexpensive, allows simple and gentle removal of the protective group by splitting off, and allows simple working up and separating-off of the enzyme.

 WO 97/03091 PCT/EP96/02782 5 The term "alkyl groups" is to be understood as meaning both "straight-chain" and "branched" alkyl groups. The term "straight-chain alkyl group" is to be understood 5 as meaning, for example, radicals such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, and the term "branched alkyl group" is to be understood as meaning radicals such as, for example, isopropyl or tert.-butyl. 10 The term halogen represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The term "alkoxy group" represents radicals such as, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, isopropoxy, isobutoxy or pentoxy. 15 Dipeptides, such as, for example, aspartam, can preferably be prepared by this process. Another advantage of the process is that the peptide coupling can be carried out in a highly dense suspension, 20 it being possible for the substrate and product to be present in partial [sic] solid form. The novel process for the synthesis of peptides using, as the intermediate product, the carbamoyl-protected peptides 25 described comprises three reaction steps. A) Preparation of the N-carbamoyl-amino acid or of the N carbamoyl-amino acid derivative 30 B) Linking of the peptide bond between the carbamoyl protected electrophile and the nucleophile C) Removal of the carbamoyl protective group by splitting off WO 97/03091 PCT/EP96/02782 6 The preparation of the N-carbamoyl-amino acid or of the N carbamoyl-amino acid derivative can be carried out in a manner known per se from the literature. Preferably, the reaction of the amino acid or of the amino acid derivative 5 with an isocyanate of the general structure VI,  
 R 
 1 -NCO VI wherein Ri has the meaning given above, in a two-phase 10 system of H 2 0/organic solvent, it being possible for the organic solvent to be, for example, toluene, chlorobenzene or tert.butyl methyl ether, is carried out. The reaction is carried out at temperatures between 0 0C and 120 *C, preferably between 20 0C and 70 0C. If appropriate, an 15 inorganic base, such as, for example, NaOH, KOH, K 2 
 CO 
 3 , Na 2 
 CO 
 3 , potassium bicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate, or an organic base, such as, for example, triethylamine or tributylamine, can be added to the reaction mixture. The phenyl isocyanate of the structure III is advantageously 20 used in a slight excess. Reactions to give the N-carbamoyl-protected amino acids or amino acid derivatives with a cyanate of the structure VII, 25 Me eOCN VII wherein M@ represents Na , K , Ag , Pb (OCN) or ammonium ions, such as, for example, tetraethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium or benzyltriethylammonium, are 30 particularly preferred. The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se in aqueous solution at temperatures between 0 0C - 120 0C, preferably between 60 0C - 100 0C, and if appropriate with Wo 9//Uiu9i PCT/EP96/02782 7 the addition of an inorganic base, such as, for example, NaOH, KOH, K 2 
 CO 
 3 or Na 2 
 CO 
 3 . It has proved favourable if the reaction is carried out in the presence of slight excesses of 1.01 - 2 equivalents, preferably 1.1 - 1.2 equivalents, 5 of cyanate. The linking of the peptide bond is carried out in a manner known per se with the aid of a hydrolase (Jakubke, Kuhl and Kannecke; Angew. Chem. 1985, vol. 97, p.p. 79 - 87). It is 10 irrelevant for the reaction conditions here whether the peptide linking proceeds under kinetic or thermodynamic control. The process according to the invention can be applied to both process variants. The term "salt form" of the compound type IV is to be understood generally as 15 meaning ionic structures. Thus, a possible cation, such as, for example, Na , Ke, Ag , Pb2e or an ammonium ion, such as, for example, tetraethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium or benzyltriethylammonium, can neutralize a negative charge on the compound type IV. The 20 negative charge here can be distributed over the molecule (compound type IV) or localized on a nitrogen atom or the carboxyl group in the form of a carboxylate group. Suprisingly, this reaction with the carbamoyl group, which 25 is novel for this reaction sequence, as the protective group proceeds in good space/time yields and allows easy isolation of the products. The broad applicability of the reaction is also surprising. 30 An acid addition salt of V is to be understood as meaning, for example, an HCl salt, HBr salt or an H 2 
 SO 
 4 salt. The carbamoyl protective group is split off, for example, under mild reaction conditions with the aid of a WO 9//u3u91 PCT/EP96/02782 8 carbamoylase. This type of removal of carbamoyl groups from peptides by splitting off is novel. It is particularly advantageous because, in addition to the enzyme, it requires only water as a substance used for the 5 cleavage and because, in addition to the peptide, only carbon dioxide and ammonia are formed as cleavage products, from which the peptide can be separated off very easily. The carbamoylase can be employed for this reaction optionally in the partly purified, purified, isolated or 10 immobilized state. The reaction is irreversible, and up to 100 % conversion are [sic] observed. The reaction is carried out in aqueous solution at temperatures between 10 - 50 'C, preferably 20 - 35 *C, especially preferably 25 30 *C, and pH values between 5 and 11, preferably 6.5 15 8.5, and especially preferably between 7 - 8. Carbon dioxide and ammonia, which optionally escape from the reaction mixture by gassing out, are formed during the hydrolysis with carbamoylase. 20 From the peptide solution treated with carbamoylase, the now unprotected peptide can be precipitated out and isolated by crystallization by means of evaporation, cooling or, if appropriate, addition of organic solvents. 25 Carbamoylases which are deposited at the Deutsche Sammlung f r Mikroorganismen [German Collection of Microorganisms] under the following numbers have proved suitable: DSM 7329, DSM 7330, DSM 9771. However, the novel process does not 30 exclude microorganisms other than those mentioned above. The removal of the carbamoyl protective group by splitting off can also be carried out analogously to that described above in the presence of an additional enzyme (in addition WO 9//Udu9i PCT/EP96/02782 9 to the carbamoylases mentioned), such as, for example, thermolysin. The carbamoyl protective group can also be split off 5 chemically. This type of removal of carbamoyl groups from peptides by splitting off is likewise novel. The removal by splitting off can in principle be carried out with any NOe donor. NaNO 2 or NO(BF 4 E are particularly suitable. The reaction is optionally carried out in an aqueous medium 10 and/or an inert organic solvent, such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as, for example, toluene or chlorobenzene, in an aliphatic hydrocarbon, a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as, for example, methylene chloride, or an ether, such as, for example, methyl tert.butyl ether or 15 tetrahydrofuran. Depending on the NO@ donor, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid, such as, for example, HCl or H 2 
 SO 
 4 . Particularly suitable reaction temperatures are temperatures between +120 0C and -30 *C, particularly preferably +60 0C and -20 0C, especially 20 preferably +25 0C and 0 0C. If an acid is added, the pH should be between -0.5 and 5, preferably 0 and 2. The reaction is advantageous since, in addition to nitrogen, C02 and, where appropriate, a salt, it produces no other by-products at all and the conversion proceeds with high 25 yields and the desired formation of product without cleavage products. Another advantage of the reaction is the easy working up. The novel process is explained in more detail with the aid 30 of the following embodiment examples, but is not limited to these.

The mixture is allowed to after-react for approx. 1 h, before the reaction mixture is neutralized with 50 wt.% sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction mixture is left overnight at RT, before the precipitate 15 which has separated out is separated off and discarded. The mother liquor is then concentrated until aspartam precipitates out. The aspartam thus obtained is dried to constant weight in vacuo at 60 0C. The reaction proceeds quantitatively.
