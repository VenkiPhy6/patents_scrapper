 In order to determine, in the effect for the other bacterial strains for belonging to corynebacterium glutamicum, to prepare bacterial strain and be named as
KCCM11347P::GntR1 (R102C), gntR1, which makes a variation, in the bacterial strain is introduced into corynebacterium glutamicum KCCM11347P (these
International Depository Authority that microorganism is disclosed as under KFCC10750 and again preservation to budapest treaty simultaneously distributes accession number
KCCM11347P, Korean patent registration No. 10-0073610).Using method in the same manner as in Example 5, the bacterium of preparation is cultivated
Strain, and compare lysine production ability and residual sugar [table 4]. 
 [table 4] 
 
 
 
 As a result, it is in the same manner as in Example 5, it is thus identified that compared with contrast groups, in terms of glucose and raw sugar, all glucose
Wear rate increase.Further, the result at the time point being all consumed as determination glucose and raw sugar, at 72 hours and 69
Small contrast groups at present consume sugar completely, and generate 38.6g/L and 41.3g/L 1B, and gntR1 variations are 61
Hour and the 58 small 1Bs for generating 38.7g/L and 41.4g/L at present.That is, the bacterial strain of gntR1 variations is introduced wherein
In the case of, be confirmed to be in terms of glucose and raw sugar according to the productivity of time 1B increases by 18% and 19% respectively

 Embodiment 7：Prepare bacterial strain and compare productivity, gntR1, which makes a variation, in the bacterial strain is introduced into 1B production bacterium
Strain CJ3P 
 In order to confirm the effect in other bacterial strains of corynebacterium glutamicum are belonged to, prepare bacterial strain and be named as
CJ3P::GntR1 (R102C), gntR1 makes a variation and is introduced into corynebacterium glutamicum CJ3P (Binder et in the bacterial strain
al.Genome Biology 2012,13:R40).CJ3P bacterial strains are the corynebacterium glutamicum bacterium with production 1B ability
Strain, wherein the variation (pyc (Pro458Ser), hom (Val59Ala), lysC (Thr311Ile)) of 3 types is based on disclosed
Technology is introduced into wild-type strain.The bacterial strain prepared using method in the same manner as in Example 5 is prepared, and measures culture solution
In each lysine production ability of time and the concentration [table 6] of residual sugar. 
 [table 6] 
 
 
 
 As a result, it is similar with embodiment 5 and 6, it is thus identified that compared with control group, the sugar consumption in gntR1 variation insertion bacterial strains
Speed increase.Further, the result at the time point being all consumed as confirmation glucose and raw sugar is small 48 in control group
When and 42 small glucose at present and raw sugar be consumed completely, and respectively produce 8.2g/L and 8.8g/L 1B, and
GntR1 (R102C) inserts bacterial strain respectively in the small lysine for generating 8.4g/L and 9.0g/L at present in 42 hours and 38.That is, exist
In the case of the bacterial strain for wherein introducing gntR1 variations, it is thus identified that increase by 17% respectively according to the generation speed of time 1B
With 13% [table 7].

 Therefore, from result above, when in the Strains for Lysine Production that gntR1 variations are introduced into corynebacterium,
Confirm because the increase in terms of sugar consumption rate, lysine throughput rate are effectively strengthened. 
 From above, those skilled in the art in the invention will be appreciated from not changing the technical concept or base of the present invention
