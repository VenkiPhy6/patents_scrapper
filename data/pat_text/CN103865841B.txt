 Invention field 
 The present invention relates to microorganism and fermentation industry field.Specifically, the present invention relates to a kind of sudden change bacterial classification that utilizes adopts solid state fermentation to brewage apricot skin slag vinegar technical field. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 At present, in fruit vinegar brewing process China mainly use have two kinds of acetic bacterias.A kind of to be the bacterial classification used in fruit vinegar liquid state fermentation be muddy mutation of Asl.41 (A.rancensL.) stench bacillus aceticus, another kind is that 1.01 bacillus aceticuss (A.lovanienseL.) Luo Wang bacillus aceticus is made in Shanghai, is that Shanghai brewing science institute makes from Dandong speed the bacterial classification be separated vinegar with Shanghai vinegar factory.These two kinds of acetic bacterias are for Vinegar Fermentation industry at first, not only acid producing ability and alcohol-tolerant ability all have much room for improvement, and the local flavor that fermentation fruit vinegar is formed is not good yet, in fruit vinegar fermenting process, there is the problem that the fragrant ability of acid producing ability, alcohol-tolerant ability and product is undesirable. 
 Known through retrieval prior art, Li Xiangli, Ran Xu adopt spectrophotometer method to have studied the clarification of chitosan to golden-silk jujube vinegar and grape vinegar respectively.Result shows: chitosan can improve the clarity of golden-silk jujube vinegar, grape vinegar.Week, poplar used polygalacturonase, Mierocrystalline cellulose and hemicellulose prozyme clarification pawpaw vinegar fermented liquid, and effect is better.History plan and control have studied the non-biological back mixing solving fruit vinegar with gelatin solution.Zhang Shanbao, Zhao Xinyu adopt diatomite to be studied red date fruit vinegar and the clarification of Jinghong apple fruit vinegar respectively.Li Hualan adopts ultra-filtration technique to be studied mulberry fruit vinegar clarification.Ma Yongkun is studied different year zhenjiang vinegar aroma component and formation mechenism thereof, takes solid-phase microextraction to extract aroma component, obtains 52 kinds of flavour substancess altogether; Separate East China to study Qishan Chinese sorghum vinegar aging period aroma component, acid is main flavor; Lu Zhoumin adopts different fermentations mode to study Persimmon fruit vinegar aroma component, altogether separating volatile components 63 kinds; Cui Tao have studied the aroma component of Chinese pear and fruit vinegar thereof, obtains 15 kinds of fruit vinegar aroma components altogether; Wang Yongling is studied sea-buckthorn fruit vinegar aroma component, is divided into from 82 kinds of aroma components. 
 Apricot skin slag is the byproduct produced after being processed into apricot pulp, apricot fruit juices and drinks.According to made, often produce 1 ton of apricot thickened pulp and about need 2.7 tons of raw material apricots, produce apricot skin slag 0.225 ton simultaneously.Along with a large amount of accumulation of apricot skin slag, most of apricot skin slag is as feed or fertilizer application, and apricot skin slag is not fully used, and added value is low, causes the serious wasting of resources.China mainly concentrates on Xinjiang to the research that apricot skin slag for comprehensive utilizes, the technological condition brewageing apricot skin slag brandy alcohol fermentation stage that it is raw material that He Wei have studied with apricot skin slag.Pan Yang, Wang Huan etc. have studied the technique extracting pigment from apricot slag.Guo Jinxi have studied and extract insoluble dietary fibre from apricot slag; Dou Qin, Li Fang etc. take ethyl acetate as extraction solvent, from apricot slag, extract carotenoid.The technique that it is raw material production fruit vinegar beverage that Li Wenhui, Xu Lin etc. have studied with apricot skin slag. 
 China's production technology of vinegar is prevailing is traditional solid state fermentation and liquid level standing for fermentation method, 6% of deep fermentation Fa Zhan China vinegar ultimate production.Utilize the research of solid state fermentation and half mushy stage fermentation process production fruit vinegar less.Be suitable for the acetic bacteria that solid state fermentation brewages apricot skin slag vinegar and still belong to blank.The research and development of apricot skin slag vinegar and vinegar beverage thereof are one of effective ways utilizing apricot skin slag.Preferably be suitable for the special acetic bacteria of brew apricot skin slag vinegar, research and innovation apricot skin slag vinegar fermentation technique are current urgent problems.The exploitation of apricot skin slag vinegar, for the added value improving apricot skin slag, promotes that the development of apricot industry has great importance.

 (1) extraction of aroma component: adopt Simultaneous distillation, measure the 500ml round-bottomed flask that the former vinegar 200ml of apricot skin slag is placed in SDE method one end, heat with electric mantle; Separately getting 50ml methylene dichloride puts in the 250ml round-bottomed flask of people's device the other end, be placed in 45 DEG C of thermostat water baths to heat, simultaneously after distillation extraction 2h, merge receiving liquid and methylene dichloride, be placed in separating funnel be separated and collect methylene dichloride in rotary evaporation bottle, 45 DEG C are concentrated into 3ml, with anhydrous sodium sulfate dehydration, treat that GC-MS analyzes. 
 (2) GC-MS analysis condition: 
 Chromatographic condition: chromatographic column is HP-5MS capillary column (30.0m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm); Temperature programming: initial temperature 40 DEG C, keep 0.5min, 80 DEG C are risen to the speed of 2 DEG C/min, keep 0min, 110 DEG C are risen to the speed of 4 DEG C/min, rise to 225 DEG C with the speed of 6 DEG C/min after rising to 190 DEG C with the speed of 10 DEG C/min again, finally rise to 240 DEG C with the speed of 5 DEG C/min, keep 5min; Injector temperature 250 DEG C; Carrier gas is He gas, flow 1ml/min; Input mode: splitting ratio 1: 30, postpones 2min, sample size 5 μ L.Mass Spectrometry Conditions; Ion source temperature is 220 DEG C; Electron energy is 70eV; Ionization mode is EI; Mass scan range is 33-500amu. 
 (3) amino acid whose mensuration adopts GB/T5009.124-2003. 
 Utilize in mutant strain bacillus aceticus AcetobacterpomorumAcF1CCTCCNo:M2013554 solid brewing apricot skin slag vinegar aroma volatile, kind and the relative content of Ester are the highest, identify 32 kinds altogether, and its relative content reaches 63.80%; Alcohols material 21 kinds, accounts for 3.47% of general volatile composition; Aldehyde material 9 kinds, accounts for 4.14% of general volatile composition; Acid 12 kinds, its relative content reaches 11.81%; The relative content of alkene class material is only 0.04%; Other materials identify 17 kinds altogether, and relative content is 1.99%, see accompanying drawing 4.17 seed amino acids detected altogether through identifying, aspartic acid content is the highest, and total amino acid content is 0.54%. 
 Above-described embodiment is only for example of the present invention is clearly described, and the restriction not to embodiment.For those of ordinary skill in the field, can also make other changes in different forms on the basis of the above description.Here exhaustive without the need to also giving all embodiments.And thus the apparent change of amplifying out or variation be still among protection scope of the present invention.
