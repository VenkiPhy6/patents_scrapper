 Technical field 
 It relates to for producing the microorganism of diamines and the method using microorganism generation diamines. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Alkamines (BAs) is nitrogen-containing compound, and it is mainly by the decarboxylating of amino acid or by aldehyde and ketone
Amination and transamination and produce.These alkamineses are for low molecular weight compound and in microorganism, plant and animal
Metabolism in synthesize, and therefore alkamines is referred to as the component that is frequently found in these cells.Especially, alkamines is
Polyamines, such as spermidine, spermine, putrescine or Putriscine and cadaverine. 
 In general, putrescine is for producing polyamines nylon -4, and 6 important source material, polyamines nylon -4,6 by making putrescine
React with adipic acid and produce.Putrescine is generally produced by being related to convert propylene to the chemical synthesis of acrylonitrile and succinonitrile
It is raw. 
 As the production method of the putrescine using microorganism, report by Escherichia coli (E.coli) and corynebacteria
(Corynebacterium) method (International Patent Publication the WO06/005603rd of the putrescine for producing high concentration that is converted；
International Patent Publication the WO09/125924th；Qian ZD et al., Biotechnol.Bioeng.104：4,651-662,2009；
Schneider et al., Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol.88：4,859-868,2010；Schneider et al.,
Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol.95,169-178.,2012).Additionally, energetically to Escherichia coli, yeast, plant
Putrescine carrier in thing and zooblast is studied (K Igarashi, Plant Physiol.Biochem.48：506-
512,2010)。 
 Meanwhile, cadaverine hydrolyzes the diamine compound of the foul smell for producing by protein during being animal tissue's corruption.Corpse
Amine has chemical formula NH 2 (CH 2 ) 5 NH 2 , its chemical formula similar to putrescine. 
 Cadaverine is used as the component of polymer such as polyamide or polyurethanes, chelating agent or other additives.Especially
Ground, it is known that the polyamide with 3,500,000 tons of annual world market is prepared by the polycondensation of cadaverine or succinic acid, and therefore corpse
Amine is paid close attention in a large number as industrial useful compound. 
 Cadaverine is diamines (Tabor and the Tabor, MicrobiolRev., 49 being found in some microorganisms：81-99,
1985).In gramnegative bacterium Escherichia coli, cadaverine is by the biosynthesis by 1B of 1B decarboxylase.
The level of cadaverine adjusts (Soksawatmaekhin by the biosynthesis of cadaverine, degraded, intake and output in Escherichia coli
Et al., MolMicrobiol., 51：1401-1412,2004).
