In particular it involves the use of recombinant DNA technology to control, and more specifically to reduce or inhibit, gene expression in plants.      Plant development is a complex physiological and biochemical process requiring the co-ordinated expression of many genes. It produces plants whose pzoducts, such as such; as roots, foliage, fruit and seeds, are used in agriculture and food production. It has long been the aim of scientists to develop methods which allow the manipulation of these genes for the purposes of producing improved plant varieties. Such varieties may be. resistant to insects or herbicides, have improved agronomic performance or be of better quality. For this purpose, many methods have been developed for the isolation of plant genes, and their characterisation both in vitro and in vivo. The _in vivo work has been supplemented by the development of transformation techniques. These permit the design of novel plant varieties, having altered and improved phenotypes desired in the agricultural industry.      One objective which has been desirable for many years, but which has only recently been achieved is the inhibition of specific genes which may have deleterious effects on plant growth oz performance or the quality of plant products. This has been done by the expression of antisense RNA to the gene which is to be inhibited. A number of examples are now found in the literature which demonstrate that this method can be made to work very effectively in plants. A typical example is disclosed in our published European patent specification EP European Patent Specification 271988. This shows the inhibition by WO 91/08299 . ~~~ ~~~~,~~~~ PC'f/G~90/O1g27 antisense RNA of enzymes, in particular polygalacturonase and pectin methylesterase, involved in cell wall modification during tomato fruit ripening. ' Antisense RNA is a technique which will now find wide application in the modification of crop plants. Its mechanism is not clearly understood. One theory is that antisense RNA produced in the nucleus of transformed plants will form RNA-RNA hybrid molecules which will lead to the inhibition of the expression of the specific gene to which ZO antisense RNA has been expressed. An alternative plausible hypothesis is that the effects is due to hybrids of RNA with DNA. In experiments carried out so far, enzyme inhibition of greater than 95% has been observed in the primary transformed plants. This level of inhibition has been increased further by genetic experiments, in which the copy number of the antisense gene has been doubled. Thus inhibition of nearly 100% of PG gene expression has been achieved.      Although this method works well, there is the need for the development of other methods which lead to the inhibition of gene expression through alternative molecular pathways in order to widen the repertoire o f technical possibilities which will permit the fine-tuning of gene expression in transgenic plants. The present invention provides such an alternative method.     According to the present invention we provide a process for the inhibition of the production of a target gene product in a plant cell which comprises generating in the cell while the target gene is being expressed mRNA from recombinant DNA coding for part only of the gene product.     We further provide novel constructs for use in the process , of the invention which comprise recombinant DNA coding for part only of a target gene naturally expressed in a cell , which DNA is expressed under the control of a promoter sequence operative in plant cells. The invention further comprises novel cells and plants in which the process is realised or which (or ancestors of which) have been transformed with the constructs of the invention.      Inhibition of gene products according to the invention may be partial or almost complete. It is not as yet clear why the invention works. The almost complete inhibition of gene expression that can be obtained under certain circumstances is particularly surprising.      DNA constructs according to the invention preferably comprise a DNA coding base sequence at least 50 bases in length. The upper limit to the base sequence depends on the size of the gene whose product is to be inhibited. The theoretical upper limit will generally have to be established by trial and error in each case. However for most practical purposes it is unnecessary to establish this upper limit, as for convenience it will generally be found suitable to use sequences between 100 and 1000 bases in length. The preparation of such constructs is described in more detail below. Many constructs suitable for use in the process of the present invention are described in European Patent Specification 271988 ~n that specification they are referred to as "sense" constructs and generally given the suffix "S".      According to the invention we propose to use both constitutive promoters (such as cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA) and inducible or developmentally regulated promoters (such as the ripe-fruit-specific polygalacturonase promoter) as circumstances require. Use of a constitutive promoter will tend to affect functions in all parts of the plant in which the target gene is expressed: while by using an inducible or tissue-specific promoter, functions may be controlled more selectively in individual organs, tissues or cells, or at particular stages of the life cycle.      The present invention will find wide potential use in modifying plants in useful ways. Plant gene products that i1 t. ~' .: , PCT/GB90/01827 ';.     WO 91/08299 r ; _ 9 _ may be inhibited by the invention are of very diverse kinds. We believe that the mechanism of inhibition is independent of the nature of the gene or gene product.     Thus in principle any the production of any kind of gene product may be inhibited.      Thus we propose to apply the process of the invention to the inhibition of gene products in all types of economically useful plants. These may include for example field crops such as corn (maize), sugar beet, sorghum, and sunflower; cereals such as wheat, barley and rice; legumes and pulses such as beans and peas; grasses; trees; leafy vegetable crops such as cabbage, lettuce and spinach; root crops such as potato, turnip, carrot; onions; fruit of all kinds; and ornamentals such as tulips, roses, carnations and azaleas. The gene products to be inhibited may be those which are not desired in the crop (eg toxins) or those whose reduction can contribute to improved plant characteristics, such as yield, field performance or product quality.      By way of example only, and without any implied limitation on its field of use, we will describe the invention further with particular reference to possible uses in controlling fruit ripening processes.      The plants to which the present invention can be applied include commercially important fruit-bearing plants, for example melons, peaches, bananas, apples, strawberries, kiwi fruit, and in particular the tomato.      In this way, plants can be generated which may have one or more of the following characteristics:      Novel flavour and aroma due to changes in the concentrations and ratios of the many aromatic compounds that contribute to fruit flavour;      Sweeter fruit (e.g. tomatoes) due to decrease in the accumulation of acids (e. g. citric or malic acid) thereby allowing the flavour of the sugars to dominate;     Modified colour due. to inhibition of the pathways of ._.~.<;. (:..   pigment biosynthesis (e. g. in the case of tomatoes, lycopene, S-carotene);    Longer shelf life and better storage characteristics due to reduced activity of degradative pathways (e. g. cell wall hydrolysis);   Improved processing characteristics due to changed activity of enzymes contributing to factors such as: viscosity, solids, pH, elasticity;   Modified fruit shape, thus improving packing and storage characteristics;   Extended leaf biosynthetic activity due to inhibition of enzymes responsible for the degradative processes involved in senescence (in particular, leaf senescence); thus..improving plant productivity.      Among the gene products that can be inhibited by the process of the invention is the enzyme polygalacturonase (PG). PG is a major cell wall hydrolase expressed specifically during the ripening of fruits. The specific embodiment of the invention that we have so far studied most thoroughly is that of PG expressed during the ripening of tomato fruit.   It has previously been demonstrated,-that one gene encodes three PG isoenzymes which are produced by posttranslational modification of the primary translation product. The exact nature of the modification of the different isoenzymes is not known. It is also controversial, which of the isoenzymes (found in the middle lamellar fraction of the tomato cell wall) is the functional enzyme. The structure of the PG mRNA has been determined, and it has been demonstrated (by comparing the sequence of the protein predicted from the mRNA with that of the PG 2a isoenzyme found in the cell wall of the tomato fruit) that the protein encoded by the mRNA contains both N- as well as C-terminal extension which have been postulated to be involved in transport of the protein to its site of action. No in vivo or in vitro experiments WO 91/08299 ~,, ,~ Q ~' !~ PCf/GB90/01827y",Ty~ ..:;   using tomato fruit cell walls have been carried out which describe the transport of the PG protein to the cell wall. The experiments described below do not elucidate the mechanism by which the invention achieves the inhibition of production of the target gene product. Various mechanisms may be envisaged, for example interference with the cell's transcription mechanism by DNA-RNA basepairing, or with RNA processing. It may prove that the mechanism is basically related to that by which antisense RNA inhibits a target gene product. Whatever the mechanism, the examples given below clearly show that the method of the invention, using the expression of part of the PG cDNA, results in substantial inhibition of PG. Tomato fruit and their seeds and progeny of these plants will find use in the production of new tomato varieties containing reduced PG. These plants will be useful in the production of tomatoes of improved quality, which may have a longer storage life, better transportability, better field holding (ie, fruit lasts longer in good condition on the plant prior to harvest) or be easier to process, and may produce improved products such as whole peeled tomatoes, puree, ketchup or sauces.     Clearly the invention can be used not only for the inhibition of PG, but also for the inhibition of other cell wall hydrolases such as pectin esterase, galactosidase, glucanase, xylanase and cellulase. It can also be used for the inhibition of other enzymes important for plant development and function.      The invention will now ,be described further with reference to the Examples and to the accompanying drawings, in which:      Figure 1 shows the construction of an expression vector according to the invention;      Figure 2 shows schematically the fragments of pTOM6 and of the tomato polygalacturonase gene clone gTOM23 used in certain of the Examples.   i _ 7 The following Examples 1 - 25 illustrate the preparation of vectors according to the invention, vectors useful for making such vectors. and vectors useful for carrying out the process of the invention. These Examples are taken from our European Patent Specification 271988~ - Example 27 shows the effectiveness of the invention in inhibiting the production of polygalacturonase. All cloning procedures are performed under standard conditions as described by Maniatis et al (1982) "Molecular Cloning", Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.      Vectors for which an NCIB Accession number are given have been deposited at the National Collections of Industrial and Marine Bacteria, Aberdeen. Scotland.        Construction of the plasmid pJRl A. Isolation of the nos 3~end. 10 pg of pWRECIC2-CAMV-CAT-1 (NCIB Accession No.12352) was digested with PvuI in order to linearise the DNA, under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The completeness of digestion was analysed by running an aliquot of the reaction of 0.8% agarose gels. The reaction was stopped by extraction with phenol/chloroform. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dried under vacuum. The cohesive ends were removed by incubation of the linearised DNA with T4 polymerase at 37°C for 30 minutes. The enzyme was inactivated by incubation at 65°C for 15 minutes. The reaction volume was increased by the addition of FIindIII buffer and HindiII enzyme was added. The reaction was ca=tied out for 2 hours at 37°C. The 250 by PvuI/HindIII     2 U: ~ 94~~ ~: .   fragment wasisolated from agarose gels by electroelution.

Removal of the CaMV 3' end from pDH51 2~g of pDH51 (Pietrzak et al, (1986) Nucleic Acids Research 14, 5857-5868) was digested with Sphl at 37°C for 2 hours under standard conditions. The reaction was stopped by extraction with phenol/chloroform. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water. Cohesive ends were removed by treatment with T4 polymerase for 30 minutes at 37°C. The buffer volume was increased and HindIII was added. The mixture was incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. The resulting 3.2 Kb fragment was isolated after gel electrophoresis on agarose gels by electroelution. The DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water.      C. Cloning of nos 3' end into pDH51 to give pJRl lpg of pDH51 prepared under (B) was ligated with 100 ng of nos 3' end prepared under (A) in a total of l5pg in the presence of T4 ligase. Incubation was carried our for 24 hours in 16°C. An aliquot of the ligation was transformed into competent TG2 cells. An aliquot of the transformation mix was plated onto ampicillin and Xgal containing L-plates. White colonies were picked, and the DNA examined by restriction analysis. Molecules containing the nos 3' end were characterised by the presence of a 260 base,pair HindIII - BamHl fragment.

Isolation of a 730 by HinfI fragment from pTOM6 5~g pTOM6 (NCIB Accession No 12351) was treated with Hinfl for 2 hours at 39°C under standard conditions. The 730 by Hinfl fragment was isolated after separation on agarose GELs. The cohesive ends of this fragment were filled in with DNA polymerase Klenov fragment A. The DNA was phenol extracted and ethanol precipitated.     B. Linearisation of pDH51 1Ng pDH51 was treated with SmaI for 2 hours at 37° under standard conditions.

The ligation mix was used to transform competent TG2 cells. The transformation mix was plated onto ampicillin-containing plates. Clones were selected, DNA isolated and analysed by digestion with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes. Plasmids were identified, and were named pDHCl and pDHC4. pDHCl contains the Hinfl fragment in the antisense orientation; pDHC4 contains the HinfI fragment in the sense orientation.   Construction of plasmid pCBl A. Isolation of a PG promoter fragment.     r' .';,~ ~ l;        Genomic clones were isolated from a partial Sau3A library of Ailsa Craig tomato DNA cloned into EMBL3 (Bird et al, in preparation). PG clones were isolated from the genomic library by screening with both the complete pTOM6 cDNA insert, and the isolated 5' Pstl/HindIII fragment from pTOM6 (Grierson et al, NAR 1986). Several overlapping clones were isolated and the transcription start site of the PG gene located by S1 mapping experiments (Bird et al in preparation 1987). The PG promoter can be located on a 1.6 Kb HindIII fragment which also contains part of the PG coding information.      B. Insertion of a SpeI site into the PG promoter fragment In order to be able to manipulate the PG promoter sequence conveniently (ie. the DNA 5' to the transcription start) a Spel site was introduced by site directed mutagenesis using standard protocols. The HindIII fragment was isolated from genomic clone gTOM23 (NCIB Accession No 12373) and cloned into the HindIII site of (commercially available vector) M13 mpl9. After annealing with a suitable mismatch primer and extension using DNA polymerase, the mixture was transformed into competent TG2 cells. Phages were plated and duplicated filters were prepared for hybridisation to the labelled mismatch primer. Putative clones were identified by hybridisation under increasingly stringent conditions, isolated and the generation of the Spel site was determined by direct DNA sequence analysis. The promoter fragment was isolated from one isolate by restriction with Spel and HindIII. This fragment was then cloned into pUCl9 (commercially available plasmid) cut with HindIII and XbaI. The promoter fragment was then transferred into Binl9 (Bevan, Nucleic Acid Research, 1984, 12, 8711-8721) cut with BamHl and HindIII. The resulting plasmid was called pCBl.

The fragment was extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, and then resuspended in lONg TE. B. Ligation of the expression cassette to Binl9 The fragment from pJR76S prepared in (A) was ligated to Binl9 (prepared as described in Example 6B). The ligation mixture was used to transform competent TG2 cells. The transformation mix was plated onto L plates containing kanamycin and Xgal. Recombinant plasmids were identified by their white colour. DNA was prepared from a number of these and analysed for the presence of the required EcoRI -HindIII fragments.      Construction of PG vector pJR86S A. Ligation of PG fragment (c) to pJR2 The products of Example 13 (A) (fragment c) and Example 11 iA) (ie pJR2 cut with HincII) were ligated at 16°C for 24 , hours under standard conditions and the mixture used to transform competent TG2 cells which were then plated on plates containing ampicillin. Transformed colonies were grown up and used to prepare plasmid DNA. The orientation ' r..~n.~~..'(I~i ~.   ''1 'J"' _ 2q _ of the insert was deduced using the EcoRI restriction pattern. These clones were called pJR86A and pJR86S, according to the orientation of the insert.       Transfer of vector pJR86S into Binl9 This Example was carried out essentially as described in Example 14, ie. the vectors was cut with HindIII under conditions of partial restriction, which was then followed by restriction with EcoRI. The resulting 3.63 Kb fragment was isolated and cloned into Binl9.      All constructs in Binl9 were intended for use in separate triparental mating experiments to allow transfer to Agrobacterium, and from there to tomato plants.     INHIBITION OF PECTIN ESTERASE      In addition to polygalacturonase, pectin esterase (PE) has been implicated in softening of the tomato fruit. A ripe tomato fruit cDNA library was screened with mixed oligonucleotide probes designed from the published amino acid sequence of PE. One clone, pPEl, (NCIB Accession No 12568) has been isolated and characterised. The complete sequence of this cDNA clone is shown in Figure 3 of European Patent Specification 271988.      We have used fragments of the cDNA to construct antisense and sense vectors. These are summarised in Table 2.    WO 91/08299 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ PCT/GB90/01827 1'~, ~,1~ ~~5~ ~V :1'.,.

B. Preparation of Agrobacteria for transformation L-Broth (5cm3) containing kanamycin at 50N/cm3 was inoculated with a single bacterial colony. The culture was grown overnight at 30°C with shaking at 150 r.p.m. This culture (500p) was inoculated into L-Broth containing kanamycin (50p/cm3) and grown as before. Immediately before use the Agrobacteria were pelleted by spinning at 3000 r.p.m. for 5 minutes and resuspended in an equal volume of liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium.     C. Preparation of plant tissue for transformation Feeder plates were prepared in 9cm diameter petri dishes as follows. Solid MS medium supplemented with 5 pM zeatin riboside and 3 pM IAA aspartic acid was overlaid with Nicotiana tabacum var Samsun suspension culture (lcm3 ).     One 9cm arid one 7cm filter paper discs were placed on the surface. Fiypocotyls from 4 week old tomato seedlings grown on MS medium were excised and placed on feeder plates. The plates were sealed with Nescofilm and incubated overnight in the plant growth room (26°C under bright fluorescent light).     D. Transformation Protocol WO 91/08299 ~~,~~ =~;~~~. PCT/GB90/01827 t ~' 2''~~   Hypocotyls from feeder plates were placed in the Agrobacteria suspension in l2cm diameter petri dishes and cut into approximately lcm lengths, removing all leaf and cotyledon axes. After 20 minutes the hypocotyl segments were returned to the feeder plates which were sealed and replaced in the growth room. After 48 hours incubation in the growth room the plant material was transferred to MS medium supplemented with 5 NM zeatin riboside, 3 uM zAA aspartic acid, 500~g/cm3 carbenicillin and 50pg/cm3 kanamycin in petri dishes. The petri dishes were sealed and returned to the growth room. From six weeks after inoculation with Agrobacterium, shoots were removed from the explants and placed on MS medium supplemented with carbenicillin (200p/cm3) for rooting. Transformed plants rooted 1-2 weeks after transfer. These plants were then grown in tissue culture for a number of weeks before being transferred to pots. These plants were then grown in growth rooms or greenhouses as appropriate. ExAMPLE 26 Molecular analysis of transformed plants Leaf material from plants which had been transformed using the vector pJRl6S (see Example 5) was analysed to detect the expression vector by Southern hybridisation or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Leaf material was used to determine the expression of RNA encoding the PG fragment.   Analysis of PG levels in fruit from plants transformed with pJRl6S.       .~ a,..'..~'; 't,' r'' ~ ~~ ~9'~ ~ ~ ~ .r~~a Transformed tomato plants identified in Example 26 as expressing RNA encoding the PG fragment from pJRl6S were grown to maturity. The fruit from each plant were analysed using standard techniques for the presence of PG enzyme.      Results for 13 such plants are shown in Table 3. Data shown here identify clearly plants in which PG activity has been reduced to 5% or less of the corresponding activity in untransformed control tomatoes. "Breaker" in the Table denotes the time at which the tomatoes begin to change colour from green to orange.      The plants in this Example are believed to be heterozygous for the pJRl6S construct: by selection and crossing plants that are homozygous for this construct can readily be obtained. These are likely to show even further reduction in PG activity.
