BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Expression of heterologous DNA sequences in a plant host is dependent upon the presence of an operably linked promoter that is functional within the plant host. 10 The type of promoter sequence chosen is based on when and where within the organism expression of the heterologous DNA is desired. Where expression in specific tissues or organs is desired, tissue-preferred promoters may be used. Where gene expression in response to a stimulus is desired, inducible promoters are the regulatory element of choice. In contrast, where continuous expression is desired 15 throughout the cells of a plant, constitutive promoters are utilized. Additional regulatory sequences upstream and/or downstream from a core promoter sequence may be included in expression constructs of transformation vectors to bring about varying levels of expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences in a transgenic plant. Genetically altering plants through the use of genetic engineering techniques to 20 produce plants with useful traits thus requires the availability of a variety of promoters. Frequently it is desirable to express a DNA sequence in particular tissues or organs of a plant. For example, increased resistance of a plant to infection by soil and/or air-borne pathogens might be accomplished by genetic manipulation of the 25 plant's genome to comprise a tissue-preferred promoter operably linked to a heterologous pathogen-resistance gene such that pathogen-resistance proteins are produced in the desired plant tissue. RTAO1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Alternatively, it might be desirable to inhibit expression of a native DNA sequence within a plant's tissues to achieve a desired phenotype. In this case, such inhibition might be accomplished with transfonnation of the plant to comprise a tissue-preferred promoter operably linked to an antisense nucleotide sequence, such 5 that expression of the antisense sequence produces an RNA transcript that interferes with translation of the mRNA of the native DNA sequence. To date, the regulation of gene expression in plant roots has not been adequately studied despite the root's importance to plant development. To some degree this is attributable to a lack of readily available, root-specific biochemical 10 functions whose genes may be cloned, studied, and manipulated. Several genes that are preferentially expressed in plant root tissues have been identified. See, for example, Takahashi et al. (1991) Plant J 1:327-332; Takahashi et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8013-8016; Hertig et al. (1991) Plant Mol Biol. 16:171-174; Xu et al. (1995) Plant Mol. Biol. 27:237-248; Capone et al. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. 15 25:681-691; Masuda et al. (1999) Plant Cell Physiol. 40(11):1177-81; Luschnig et al. (1998) Genes Dev. 12(14):2175-87; Goddemcier et al. (1998) Plant Mol. Biol. 36(5):799-802; and Yamamoto et al. (1991) Plant Cell 3(4):371-82. Though root specific promoters have been characterized in several types of plants, no root-specific promoters from maize have been described in the literature. 20 Constitutive expression of some heterologous proteins, such as insecticides, leads to undesirable phenotypic and agronomic effects. Limiting expression of insecticidal proteins, for example, to the target tissues of insect feeding (root, in this case), allows the plant to devote more energy to normal growth rather than toward expression of the protein throughout the plant. Using root-preferred promoters, one 25 can also limit expression of the protein in undesirable portions of the plant. However, many of the root-preferred promoters that have been isolated do not direct the expression of sufficient amounts of a transgene for efficacy in plants. Thus, the isolation and characterization of tissue-preferred, particularly root-preferred, promoters that can direct transcription of a sufficiently high level of a desired 30 heterologous nucleotide sequence is needed. -2 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compositions and methods for regulating gene expression in a plant are provided. Compositions comprise novel nucleotide sequences for a promoter that initiates transcription in a root-preferred manner. More particularly, transcriptional 5 initiation regions isolated from the plant gene CRWAQ81 are provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 20 The compositions of the present invention comprise novel nucleotide sequences for plant promoters, particularly a "root-preferred" promoter for the CRWAQ81 gene, more particularly, the maize CRWAQ8 1 promoter. In particular, the present invention provides for isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and the nucleotide sequence set forth 25 in SEQ ID NO:2, plant promoter sequences deposited in bacterial hosts as Patent Deposit No. PTA-5126, and fragments, variants, and complements thereof. Plasmids containing the plant promoter nucleotide sequences of the invention were deposited with the Patent Depository of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Virginia, on April 4, 2003, and assigned Patent Deposit No. PTA 30 5126. This deposit will be maintained under the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of -4 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Patent Procedure. This deposit was made merely as a convenience for those of skill in the art and is not an admission that a deposit is required under 35 U.S.C. ยง112. The promoter sequences of the invention are useful for expressing operably linked nucleotide sequences in a tissue-preferred, particularly a root-preferred 5 manner. The sequences of the invention also find use in the construction of expression vectors for subsequent transformation into plants of interest, as probes for the isolation of other CRWAQ8 1-like genes, as molecular markers, and the like. The CRWAQ81 promoter of the invention was isolated from the 5' untranslated region flanking the CRWAQ81 transcription initiation site. The specific 10 method used to obtain the CRWAQ8 1 promoter of the present invention is described in Example 5 below. The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an element" means one or more elements. 15 The invention encompasses isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid compositions. An "isolated" or "substantially purified" nucleic acid molecule, or biologically active portion thereof, is substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. Optimally, an 20 "isolated" nucleic acid is free of sequences (optimally protein encoding sequences) that naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb, or 0.1 kb of nucleotide 25 sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. The compositions of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising the promoter nucleotide sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2. By "promoter" is intended to mean a regulatory region of DNA usually comprising a 30 TATA box capable of directing RNA polymerase II to initiate RNA synthesis at the appropriate transcription initiation site for a particular coding sequence. A promoter may additionally comprise other recognition sequences generally positioned upstream -5 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 or 5'to the TATA box, referred to as upstream promoter elements, which influence the transcription initiation rate. It is recognized that having identified the nucleotide sequences for the promoter regions disclosed herein, it is within the state of the art to isolate and identify further regulatory elements in the 5'untranslated region upstream 5 from the particular promoter regions identified herein. Thus, for example, the promoter regions disclosed herein may further comprise upstream regulatory elements such as those responsible for tissue and temporal expression of the coding sequence, enhancers, and the like. See particularly, Australian Patent No. AU-A-77751/94 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,466,785 and 5,635,618. 10 In the same manner, the promoter elements that enable expression in the desired tissue such as the root, can be identified, isolated, and used with other core promoters to confer root-preferred expression. In this aspect of the invention, a "core promoter" is a promoter without promoter elements. The core promoter region contains a TATA box and often an initiator element as well as the initiation site. The 15 precise length of the core promoter region is not fixed but is usually easily recognizable. Such a region is normally present, with some variation, in most promoters. The base sequences lying between the various well-characterized elements appear to be of lesser importance. The core promoter region is often referred to as a minimal promoter region because it is functional on its own to 20 promote a basal level of transcription. The maize root-preferred promoter sequences of the present invention, when assembled within a DNA construct such that the promoter is operably linked to a nucleotide sequence of interest, enables expression of the nucleotide sequence in the cells of a plant stably transformed with this DNA construct. "Operably linked" is 25 intended to mean a functional linkage between two or more elements. For example, an operable linkage between a promoter of the present invention and a heterologous nucleotide of interest is a functional link that allows for expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest. Operably linked elements may be contiguous or non-contiguous. When used to refer to the joining of two protein 30 coding regions, by operably linked is intended that the coding regions are in the same reading frame. The cassette may additionally contain at least one additional gene to be cotransformed into the organism. Alternatively, the additional gene(s) can be -6 RTA1/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 provided on multiple expression cassettes. Such an expression cassette is provided with a plurality of restriction sites and/or recombination sites for insertion of the heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest to be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions. The expression cassette may additionally contain selectable 5 marker genes. In this manner, the nucleotide sequences for the promoters of the invention are provided in expression cassettes along with a nucleotide sequence of interest, typically a heterologous nucleotide sequence, for expression in the plant of interest. By "heterologous nucleotide sequence" is intended to mean a sequence that is not 10 naturally operably linked with the promoter sequence, including non-naturally occurring multiple copies of a naturally occurring DNA sequence. While this nucleotide sequence is heterologous to the promoter sequence, it may be homologous, or native, or heterologous, or foreign, to the plant host. It is recognized that the promoter may also drive expression of its homologous or native nucleotide sequence. 15 In this case, the transformed plant will have a change in phenotype. Heterologous nucleotide sequences include, but are not limited to, insecticidal coding sequences, nematicidal coding sequences, herbicide-tolerance coding sequences, anti-microbial coding sequences, anti-fungal coding sequences, anti-viral coding sequences, abiotic stress tolerance coding sequences, nutritional quality coding sequences, visible 20 marker coding sequences, and selectable marker coding sequences. The expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences can vary depending upon the type of promoter utilized. One category of promoters known as "tissue specific promoters" express the genes under their control in only one or more cell types in specific organs, specific tissues, or specific cell types. Tissue-specific 25 promoters include promoters that are temporally regulated, such as in early or late embryogenesis, during fruit ripening in developing seeds or fruit, in fully differentiated leaf, or at the onset of senescence. In contrast, "constitutive promoters" refer to promoters that are able to express the genes under their control in all or nearly all of the plant tissues during all or nearly all developmental stages of the plant, 30 thereby generating "constitutive expression" of the genes. Yet another type of promoter known as an "inducible promoter" is a type of regulated promoter that can -7 RTAO1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 be turned on in one or more cell types by an external stimulus, such as a chemical, light, hormone, stress, or a pathogen. The regulatory sequences of the present invention, when operably linked to a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest and stably incorporated into the plant 5 genome drive "root-preferred" expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence. By "root-preferred" is intended that expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence is most abundant in the root. By "root" is intended to mean any part of the root structure, including but not limited to, the root cap, apical meristem, protoderm, ground meristem, procambium, endodermis, cortex, vascular cortex, epidermis, and 10 the like. While some level of expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence may occur in other plant tissue types, expression occurs most abundantly in the root, which may include, but is not limited to primary, lateral, and adventitious roots. Modifications of the isolated promoter sequences of the present invention can provide for a range of expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence. Thus, they 15 may be modified to be weak promoters or strong promoters. Generally, by "weak promoter" is intended to mean a promoter that drives expression of a coding sequence of interest at a low level. By "low level" is intended to mean that the transcript for the coding sequence of interest represents about 1 out of every 10,000 transcripts to about 1 out of every 500,000 transcripts being produced in the cell at any given point in 20 time. Conversely, under equivalent cellular conditions, a strong promoter drives expression of a coding sequence of interest at a high level, such that the transcript for the coding sequence of interest represents about 1 out of every 10 transcripts to about 1 out of every 1,000 transcripts being produced in the cell at any given point in time. Alternatively, it is recognized that weak promoters also encompass promoters that are 25 expressed in only a few cells and not in others to give a total low level of expression at any given point in time. Fragments and variants of the disclosed promoter sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. By "fragment" is intended to mean a portion of the promoter sequence. Fragments of a promoter sequence may retain biological 30 activity and hence be capable of driving root-preferred expression of an operably linked nucleotide sequence. Thus, for example, less than the entire promoter sequence disclosed herein may be utilized to drive expression of an operably linked -8 RTA1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 nucleotide sequence of interest, such as a nucleotide sequence encoding a heterologous protein. It is within the skill in the art to determine whether such fragments decrease expression levels or alter the nature of expression, i.e., constitutive or inducible expression. Alternatively, fragments of a promoter 5 nucleotide sequence that are useful as hybridization probes, as described below, generally do not retain this regulatory activity. Thus, fragments of a promoter sequence may range from at least about 20 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides, and up to the full-length promoter sequence of the invention. Thus, a fragment of a CRWAQ81 promoter nucleotide sequence may encode a 10 biologically active portion of the CRWAQ81 promoter or it may be a fragment that can be used as a hybridization probe or PCR primer using methods disclosed below. A biologically active portion of a CRWAQ81 promoter can be prepared by isolating a portion of one of the CRWAQ81 promoter nucleotide sequences of the invention and assessing the activity of that portion of the CRWAQ81 promoter. Nucleic acid 15 molecules that are fragments of a promoter nucleotide sequence comprise at least 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, 100, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 800, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000 contiguous nucleotides, or up to the number of nucleotides present in full-length promoter nucleotide sequence disclosed herein, e.g., 2136 nucleotides for SEQ ID NO:1. 20 "Contiguous" nucleotides, as used herein, refers to nucleic acid sequences that are immediately preceding or following one another. Nucleic acid molecules that are fragments of the full length CRWAQ81 promoter that are capable of functioning as a promoter may comprise, for example, nucleotides 931 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 936 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; 25 nucleotides 941 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 946 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1, nucleotides 951 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 956 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 961 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 971 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 981 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 991 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1001 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1051 to 2113 of SEQ ID 30 NO:1; nucleotides 1101 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1151 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1201 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1251 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1301 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1351 to 2113 -9 RTA01/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1401 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1451 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1501 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1551 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1601 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1651 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1701 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; 5 nucleotides 1751 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1777 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1782 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1787 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1792 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1801 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1851 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1901 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 1951 to 2113 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 931 to 2110 10 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 931 to 2107 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 931 to 2104 of SEQ ID NO:1; nucleotides 931 to 2100 of SEQ ID NO:1. The nucleotides of such fragments will usually comprise the TATA recognition sequence of the particular promoter sequence. Such fragments may be obtained by use of restriction enzymes to cleave the naturally occurring promoter 15 nucleotide sequence disclosed herein; by synthesizing a nucleotide sequence from the naturally occurring sequence of the promoter DNA sequence; or may be obtained through the use of PCR technology. See particularly, Mullis et al. (1987) Methods Enzynol. 155:335-350, and Erlich, ed. (1989) PCR Technology (Stockton Press, New York). Variants of these promoter fragments, such as those resulting from site 20 directed mutagenesis, are also encompassed by the compositions of the present invention. By "variants" is intended to mean sequences having substantial similarity with a promoter sequence disclosed herein. For nucleotide sequences, a variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more internal sites 25 within the native nucleic acid molecule and/or a substitution of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a "native" nucleic acid molecule comprises a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence. Naturally occurring variants such as these can be identified with the use of well known molecular biology techniques, as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction 30 (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined below. Variant nucleotide sequences also include synthetically derived nucleotide sequences, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis. Generally, variants of a particular -10 RTAOI/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 nucleotide sequence of the invention will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular nucleotide sequence as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere 5 herein. Biologically active variants are also encompassed by the present invention. Biologically active variants include, for example, the native promoter sequence of the invention having one or more nucleotide substitutions, deletions, or insertions. Promoter activity may be measured by using techniques such as Northern blot 10 analysis, reporter activity measurements taken from transcriptional fusions, and the like. See, for example, Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York), herein incorporated by reference. Alternatively, levels of a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the like produced under the control of a 15 promoter fragment or variant can be measured. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,072,050, herein incorporated by reference. Methods for mutagenesis and nucleotide sequence alterations are well known in the art. See, for example, Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-492; Kunkel et al. (1987) Methods in Enzymol. 154:367-382; U.S. Patent No. 4,873,192; 20 Walker and Gaastra, eds. (1983) Techniques in Molecular Biology (MacMillan Publishing Company, New York) and the references cited therein. The nucleotide sequences of the invention can be used to isolate corresponding sequences from other organisms, particularly other plants, more particularly other monocots. In this manner, methods such as PCR, hybridization, and 25 the like can be used to identify such sequences based on their sequence homology to the sequences set forth herein. Sequences isolated based on their sequence identity to the entire CRWAQ81 promoter sequence set forth herein or to fragments thereof are encompassed by the present invention. Thus, isolated nucleic acid molecules that have promoter activity and which hybridize under stringent conditions to the promoter 30 sequences disclosed herein, or to variants or fragments thereof, are encompassed by the present invention. - 11 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 In a PCR approach, oligonucleotide primers can be designed for use in PCR reactions to amplify corresponding DNA sequences from cDNA or genomic DNA extracted from any plant of interest. Methods for designing PCR primers and PCR cloning are generally known in the art and are disclosed in Sambrook et al. (1989) 5 Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, New York). See also Innis et al., eds. (1990) PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Academic Press, New York); Innis and Gelfand, eds. (1995) PCR Strategies (Academic Press, New York); and Innis and Gelfand, eds. (1999) PCR Methods Manual (Academic Press, New York). Known methods of PCR 10 include, but are not limited to, methods using paired primers, nested primers, single specific primers, degenerate primers, gene-specific primers, vector-specific primers, partially-mismatched primers, and the like. In hybridization techniques, all or part of a known nucleotide sequence is used as a probe that selectively hybridizes to other corresponding nucleotide sequences 15 present in a population of cloned genomic DNA fragments or cDNA fragments (i.e., genomic or cDNA libraries) from a chosen organism. The hybridization probes may be genomic DNA fragments, cDNA fragments, RNA fragments, or other oligonucleotides, and may be labeled with a detectable group such as 32 P, or any other detectable marker. Thus, for example, probes for hybridization can be made by 20 labeling synthetic oligonucleotides based on the CRWAQ81 promoter sequences of the invention. Methods for the preparation of probes for hybridization and for the construction of cDNA and genomic libraries are generally known in the art and are disclosed in Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, New York). 25 For example, the entire CRWAQ81 promoter sequences disclosed herein, or one or more portions thereof, may be used as a probe capable of specifically hybridizing to corresponding CRWAQ81 promoter sequences. To achieve specific hybridization under a variety of conditions, such probes include sequences that are unique among CRWAQ81 promoter sequences and are optimally at least about 10 30 nucleotides in length, and most optimally at least about 20 nucleotides in length. Such probes may be used to amplify corresponding CRWAQ81 promoter sequences from a chosen plant by PCR. This technique may also be used to isolate additional - 12 RTAOI/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 coding sequences from a desired plant or as a diagnostic assay to determine the presence of coding sequences in a plant. Hybridization techniques include hybridization screening of plated DNA libraries (either plaques or colonies; see, for example, Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., 5 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, New York). Hybridization of such sequences may be carried out under stringent conditions. By "stringent conditions" or "stringent hybridization conditions" conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target sequence to a detectably greater degree than to other sequences (e.g., at least 2-fold over background) are 10 intended. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing conditions, target sequences that are 100% complementary to the probe can be identified (homologous probing). Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in sequences so that lower degrees of similarity 15 are detected (heterologous probing). Generally, a probe is less than about 1000 nucleotides in length, optimally less than 500 nucleotides in length. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30'C for short probes 20 (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60'C for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) at 37'C, and a wash in 1X to 2X SSC (20X SSC = 3.0 25 M NaC1/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55'C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions include hybridization in 40 to 45% formamide, 1.0 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37'C, and a wash in 0.5X to 1X SSC at 55 to 60'C. Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 3 7'C, and a final wash in 0. 1X SSC at 60 to 65'C for at least about 20 minutes. Duration of 30 hybridization is generally less than about 24 hours, usually about 4 to about 12 hours. The duration of the wash time will be at least a length of time sufficient to reach equilibrium. Optionally, wash buffers may comprise about 0.1% to about 1% SDS. - 13 RTA1/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. The Tm (thermal melting point) is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched 5 probe. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl (1984) Anal. Biochem. 138:267-284: Tm = 81.5'C + 16.6 (log M) + 0.41 (%GC) - 0.61 (% fonn) - 500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, %GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length 10 of the hybrid in base pairs. Tm is reduced by about 1'C for each 1% of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization, and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with >90% identity are sought, the Tm can be decreased 10'C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5'C lower than the Tm for the specific sequence and its complement at a 15 defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3, or 4'C lower than the Tm; moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9, or 1 OC lower than the Tm; low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 20'C lower than Tm. Using the equation, hybridization and wash 20 compositions, and desired Tm, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a Tm of less than 45C (aqueous solution) or 32'C (formamide solution), it is preferred to increase the SSC concentration so that a higher temperature can be used. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic 25 acids is found in Tijssen (1993) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology--Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I, Chapter 2 (Elsevier, New York); and Ausubel et al., eds. (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 2 (Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York). See also Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold 30 Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, New York). - 14 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Thus, isolated sequences that have root-preferred promoter activity and which hybridize under stringent conditions to the CRWAQ81 promoter sequences disclosed herein, or to fragments thereof, are encompassed by the present invention. The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between 5 two or more nucleic acids or polynucleotides: (a) "reference sequence", (b) "comparison window", (c) "sequence identity", and (d) "percentage of sequence identity". (a) As used herein, "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety 10 of a specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence, or the complete cDNA or gene sequence. (b) As used herein, "comparison window" makes reference to a contiguous and specified segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) 15 compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide sequence a gap 20 penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Thus, the determination of percent sequence identity between any two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Non-limiting examples of such mathematical algorithms are the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) CABIOS 4:11 25 17; the local alignment algorithm of Smith et al. (1981) Adv. Apple. Math. 2:482; the global alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 453; the search-for-local alignment method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:2444-2448; and the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 872264, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Nat. Acad. 30 Sci. USA 90:5873-5877. Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations - 15 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0); the ALIGN PLUS program (Version 3.0, copyright 1997); and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package of Genetics 5 Computer Group, Version 10 (available from Accehys, 9685 Scranton Road, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA). The scoring matrix used in Version 10 of the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package is BLOSUM62 (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1989) Proc. Nat?. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default 10 parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins et al. (1988) Gene 73:237-244 (1988); Higgins et al. (1989) CABIOS 5:151-153; Corpet et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:10881-90; Huang et al. (1992) CABIOS 8:155-65; and Pearson et al. (1994) Meth. Mol. Biol. 24:307-331. The ALIGN and the ALIGN PLUS programs are based on the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) supra. A PAM120 15 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used with the ALIGN program when comparing amino acid sequences. The BLAST programs of Altschul et al (1990) J Mol. Biol. 215:403 are based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) supra. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTN program, score = 100, wordlength = 12, to obtain nucleotide sequences 20 homologous to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTX program, score = 50, wordlength = 3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein or polypeptide of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) 25 Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules. See Altschul et al. (1997) supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTN for nucleotide sequences, BLASTX for proteins) can be used. See the web site for the National 30 Center for Biotechnology Information on the world wide web. Alignment may also be performed manually by inspection. - 16 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Unless otherwise stated, nucleotide sequence identity/similarity values provided herein refer to the value obtained using GAP Version 10 using the following parameters: % identity and % similarity for a nucleotide sequence using GAP Weight of 50 and Length Weight of 3; and the nwsgapdna.cmp scoring matrix; % identity and 5 % similarity for an amino acid sequence using GAP Weight of 8 and Length Weight of 2, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix; or any equivalent program thereof. By "equivalent program" is intended to mean any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when 10 compared to the corresponding alignment generated by GAP Version 10. The GAP program uses the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453, to find the alignment of two complete sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. GAP considers all possible alignments and gap positions and creates the alignment with the largest 15 number of matched bases and the fewest gaps. It allows for the provision of a gap creation penalty and a gap extension penalty in units of matched bases. GAP must make a profit of gap creation penalty number of matches for each gap it inserts. If a gap extension penalty greater than zero is chosen, GAP must, in addition, make a profit for each gap inserted of the length of the gap times the gap extension penalty. 20 Default gap creation penalty values and gap extension penalty values in Version 10 of the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package for protein sequences are 8 and 2, respectively. For nucleotide sequences the default gap creation penalty is 50 while the default gap extension penalty is 3. The gap creation and gap extension penalties can be expressed as an integer selected from the group of integers consisting of from 25 0 to 200. Thus, for example, the gap creation and gap extension penalties can each be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or greater. GAP presents one member of the family of best alignments. There may be many members of this family, but no other member has a better quality. GAP displays four figures of merit for alignments: Quality, Ratio, Identity, and Similarity. 30 The Quality is the metric maximized in order to align the sequences. Ratio is the quality divided by the number of bases in the shorter segment. Percent Identity is the percent of the symbols that actually match. Percent Similarity is the percent of the -17 RTAO1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 symbols that are similar. Symbols that are across from gaps are ignored. A similarity is scored when the scoring matrix value for a pair of symbols is greater than or equal to 0.50, the similarity threshold. (c) As used herein, "sequence identity" or "identity" in the context of two 5 nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are 10 substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have 15 "sequence similarity" or "similarity". Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative 20 substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, California). (d) As used herein, "percentage of sequence identity" means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison 25 window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both 30 sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. - 18 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 The CRWAQ81 promoter sequences disclosed herein are useful for genetic engineering of plants, e.g. for the production of a transformed or transgenic plant, to express a phenotype of interest. Various changes in phenotype are of interest including, but not limited to, modifying expression of a gene in a plant root, altering a 5 plant's pathogen or insect defense mechanism, increasing the plant's tolerance to herbicides, altering root development to respond to enviromnental stress, and the like. These results can be achieved by providing expression of heterologous or increased expression of endogenous products in plants. Alternatively, the results can be achieved by providing for a reduction of expression of one or more endogenous 10 products, particularly enzymes, transporters, or cofactors, or affecting nutrient uptake in the plant. These changes result in a change in phenotype of the transformed plant. As used herein, the terms "transformed plant" and "transgenic plant" refer to a plant that comprises within its genome a heterologous polynucleotide. Generally, the heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome of a transgenic or 15 transformed plant such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant expression cassette. It is to be understood that as used herein the term "transgenic" includes any cell, cell line, callus, tissue, plant part, or plant the genotype of which has been altered by the presence of heterologous nucleic acid 20 including those transgenics initially so altered as well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic. The term "transgenic" as used herein does not encompass the alteration of the genome (chromosomal or extra chromosomal) by conventional plant breeding methods or by naturally occurring events such as random cross-fertilization, non-recombinant viral infection, non 25 recombinant bacterial transformation, non-recombinant transposition, or spontaneous mutation. A transgenic "event" is produced by transformation of plant cells with a heterologous DNA construct, including a nucleic acid expression cassette that comprises a transgene of interest, the regeneration of a population of plants resulting 30 from the insertion of the transgene into the genome of the plant, and selection of a particular plant characterized by insertion into a particular genome location. An event is characterized phenotypically by the expression of the transgene. At the genetic - 19 RTA1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 level, an event is part of the genetic makeup of a plant. The term "event" also refers to progeny produced by a sexual outcross between the transformant and another variety that includes the heterologous DNA. As used herein, the term "plant" includes reference to whole plants, plant 5 organs (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, etc.), seeds, plant cells, and progeny of same. Parts of transgenic plants within the scope of the invention are to be understood to comprise, for example, plant cells, protoplasts, tissues, callus, embryos as well as flowers, stems, fruits, ovules, leaves, or roots originating in transgenic plants or their progeny previously transformed with a DNA molecule of the invention, and therefore 10 consisting at least in part of transgenic cells. As used herein, the term "plant cell" includes, without limitation, seeds suspension cultures, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores. The class of plants that can be used in the methods of the invention is generally as broad as the class of higher 15 plants amenable to transformation techniques, including both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Genes of interest are reflective of the commercial markets and interests of those involved in the development of the crop. Crops and markets of interest change, and as developing nations open up world markets, new crops and technologies will 20 emerge also. In addition, as our understanding of agronomic traits and characteristics such as yield and heterosis increase, the choice of genes for transformation will change accordingly. General categories of genes of interest for the present invention include, but are not limited to, for example, those genes involved in information, such as Zinc fingers, those involved in communication, such as kinases, and those involved 25 in housekeeping, such as heat shock proteins. More specific categories of transgenes, for example, include, but are not limited to, genes encoding proteins conferring resistance to abiotic stress, such as drought, temperature, salinity, and toxins such as pesticides and herbicides, or to biotic stress, such as attacks by fungi, viruses, bacteria, insects, and nematodes, and development of diseases associated with these 30 organisms. It is recognized that any gene of interest can be operably linked to the promoter sequences of the invention and expressed in plant roots. - 20 RTAOI/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 A DNA construct comprising one of these genes of interest can be used with transformation techniques, such as those described below, to create disease or insect resistance in susceptible plant phenotypes or to enhance disease or insect resistance in resistant plant phenotypes. Accordingly, the invention encompasses methods that are 5 directed to protecting plants against fungal pathogens, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, insects, and the like. By "disease resistance" or "insect resistance" is intended to mean that the plants avoid the harmful symptoms that are the outcome of the plant pathogen interactions. Disease resistance and insect resistance genes such as lysozymes, cecropins, 10 maganins, or thionins for antibacterial protection, or the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins such as glucanases and chitinases for anti-fungal protection, or Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxins, protease inhibitors, collagenases, lectins, and glycosidases for controlling nematodes or insects are all examples of useful gene products. Pathogens of the invention include, but are not limited to, viruses or viroids, 15 bacteria, insects, nematodes, fungi, and the like. Viruses include but are not limited to tobacco or cucumber mosaic virus, ringspot virus, necrosis virus, maize dwarf mosaic virus, etc. Nematodes include but are not limited to parasitic nematodes such as root knot, cyst, and lesion nematodes, including Heterodera spp., Meloidogyne spp., and Globodera spp.; particularly members of the cyst nematodes, including, but not 20 limited to, Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode); Heterodera schachtii (beet cyst nematode); Heterodera avenae (cereal cyst nematode); and Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pailida (potato cyst nematodes). Lesion nematodes include but are not limited to Pratylenchus spp. Genes encoding disease resistance traits include but are not limited to 25 detoxification genes, such as against fumonisin (U.S. Patent No. 5,792,931); avirulence (avr) and disease resistance (R) genes (Jones et al. (1994) Science 266:789; Martin et al. (1993) Science 262:1432; Mindrinos et al. (1994) Cell 78:1089); and the like. Herbicide resistance traits may be introduced into plants by genes coding for 30 resistance to herbicides that act to inhibit the action of acetolactate synthase (ALS), in particular the sulfonylurea-type herbicides (e.g., the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene containing mutations leading to such resistance, in particular the S4 and/or Hra -21 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 mutations), genes coding for resistance to herbicides that act to inhibit the action of glutamine synthase, such as phosphinothricin or basta (e.g., the bar gene), glyphosate (e.g., the EPSPS gene and the GAT gene; see, for example, U.S. Publication No. 20040082770 and International Publication No. WO 03/092360) or other such genes 5 known in the art. The bar gene encodes resistance to the herbicide basta, the nptI gene encodes resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin and geneticin, and the ALS gene encodes resistance to the herbicide chlorsulfuron. Exogenous products include plant enzymes and products as well as those from other sources including prokaryotes and other eukaryotes. Such products include 10 enzymes, cofactors, hormones, and the like. Examples of other applicable genes and their associated phenotype include but are not limited to the gene that encodes viral coat protein and/or RNA, or other viral or plant genes that confer viral resistance; genes that confer fungal resistance; genes that confer insect resistance; genes that promote yield improvement; and genes that 15 provide for resistance to stress, such as dehydration resulting from heat and salinity, toxic metal or trace elements, or the like. In other embodiments of the present invention, the CRWAQ81 promoter sequences are operably linked to genes of interest that improve plant growth or increase crop yields under high plant density conditions. For example, the 20 CRWAQ81 promoter of the invention may be operably linked to nucleotide sequences expressing agronomically important genes that result in improved primary or lateral root systems. Such genes include, but are not limited to, nutrient/water transporters and growth inducers. Examples of such genes, include but are not limited to, maize plasma membrane H+-ATPase (MHA2) (Frias et al. (1996) Plant Cell 25 8:1533-44); AKT1, a component of the potassium uptake apparatus in Arabidopsis (Spalding et al. (1999) J. Gen. Physiol. 113:909-18); RML genes, which activate cell division cycle in the root apical cells (Cheng et a. (1995) Plant Physiol. 108:881); maize glutamine synthetase genes (Sukanya et a. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. 26:193 5 46); and hemoglobin (Duff et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 27:16749-16752; Arredondo 30 Peter et al. (1997) Plant Physiol. 115:1259-1266; Arredondo-Peter et a. (1997) Plant Physiol. 114:493-500 and the references cited therein). The CRWAQ81 promoter - 22 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 sequences may also be useful in expressing antisense nucleotide sequences of genes that negatively affect root development under high-planting density conditions. The heterologous nucleotide sequence operably linked to the CRWAQ81 promoter and related promoter sequences disclosed herein may be an antisense 5 sequence for a targeted gene. By "antisense DNA nucleotide sequence" is intended to mean a sequence that is in inverse orientation to the 5'-to-3'normal orientation of that nucleotide sequence. When delivered into a plant cell, expression of the antisense DNA sequence prevents normal expression of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. The antisense nucleotide sequence encodes an RNA transcript that is 10 complementary to and capable of hybridizing to the endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. In this case, production of the native protein encoded by the targeted gene is inhibited to achieve a desired phenotypic response. Modifications of the antisense sequences may be made as long as the sequences hybridize to and interfere with 15 expression of the corresponding mRNA. In this manner, antisense constructions having 70%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% sequence identity to the corresponding antisense sequences may be used. Furthermore, portions of the antisense nucleotides may be used to disrupt the expression of the target gene. Generally, sequences of at least 50 nucleotides, 100 nucleotides, 200 nucleotides, or greater may be used. Thus, the 20 promoter sequences disclosed herein may be operably linked to antisense DNA sequences to reduce or inhibit expression of a native protein in the plant root. In one embodiment of the invention, expression cassettes will comprise a transcriptional initiation region comprising one of the promoter nucleotide sequences disclosed herein, or variants or fragments thereof, operably linked to a heterologous 25 nucleotide sequence whose expression is to be controlled by the root-preferred promoters of the invention. Such an expression cassette is provided with a plurality of restriction sites for insertion of the nucleotide sequence to be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions. The expression cassette may additionally contain selectable marker genes. 30 The expression cassette will include in the 5 -to-3' direction of transcription, a transcriptional and translational initiation region (i.e., a root-preferred promoter described herein), a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest, and a transcriptional - 23 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 and translational termination region (i.e., termination region) functional in plants. The termination region may be native with the transcriptional initiation region comprising the promoter nucleotide sequence of the present invention, may be native with the DNA sequence of interest, may be native with the plant host, or may be 5 derived from another source (i.e., foreign or heterologous to the promoter, the heterologous sequence of interest, the plant host, or any combination thereof). Convenient termination regions are available from the Ti-plasmid of A. tumnefaciens, such as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase termination regions. See also, Guerineau et al. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 262:141-144; Proudfoot (1991) Cell 64:671 10 674; Sanfacon et al. (1991) Genes Dev. 5:141-149; Mogen et al. (1990) Plant Cell 2:1261-1272; Munroe et al.

The expression cassette comprising a promoter sequence of the present invention operably linked to a heterologous nucleotide sequence may also contain at 15 least one additional nucleotide sequence for a gene to be cotransformed into the organism. Alternatively, the additional sequence(s) can be provided on another expression cassette. The expression cassettes comprising a promoter sequence of the present invention may additionally contain 5'non-translated leader sequences or 5' non 20 coding sequences. As used herein, "5'leader sequence," "translation leader sequence," or "5'non-coding sequence" refer to that DNA sequence portion of a gene between the promoter and coding sequence that is transcribed into RNA and is present in the fully processed mRNA upstream (5') of the translation start codon. A 5'non translated leader sequence is usually characterized as that portion of the mRNA 25 molecule which most typically extends from the 5' CAP site to the AUG protein translation initiation codon. The translation leader sequence may affect processing of the primary transcript to mRNA, mRNA stability or translation efficiency (Turner et al. (1995) Molecular Biotechnology 3:225). Thus, translation leader sequences play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Translation leaders are known 30 in the art and include but are not limited to: picomavirus leaders, for example, EMCV leader (Encephalomyocarditis 5'noncoding region) (Elroy-Stein et al. (1989) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6126-6130); potyvirus leaders, for example, TEV leader -24 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 (Tobacco Etch Virus) (Allison et al. (1986)); MDMV leader (Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus); human immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP) (Macejak et al. (1991) Nature 353:90-94); untranslated leader from the coat protein mRNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV RNA 4) (Jobling et al. (1987) Nature 325:622-625); tobacco 5 mosaic virus leader (TMV) (Gallie et al. (1989) Molecular Biology ofRNA, pages 237-256); and maize chlorotic mottle virus leader (MCMV) (Lommel et al. (1991) Virology 81:382-385). See also Della-Cioppa et al. (1987) Plant Physiology 84:965 968. Various intron sequences have been shown to enhance expression, particularly 10 in monocotyledonous cells. The introns of the maize AdhI gene have been found to significantly enhance the expression of the wild-type gene under its cognate promoter when introduced into maize cells. Intron 1 was found to be particularly effective and enhanced expression in fusion constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (Callis et al., (1987) Genes Develop. 1:1183-1200). In the same experimental 15 system, the intron from the maize bronze 1 gene had a similar effect in enhancing expression. The AdhI intron has also been shown to enhance CAT expression 12-fold (Mascarenhas et al. (1990) Plant Mol. Biol. 6:913-920). Intron sequences have routinely been incorporated into plant transformation vectors, typically within the non-translated leader. See also, Christensen and Quail (1996) Transgenic Res. 5:213 20 218; Christensen et al. (1992) Plant Molecular Biology 18:675-689; Kyozuka et al. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 228:40-48; and Kyozuka et al. (1990) Maydica 35:353-357. The expression cassette comprising a promoter sequence of the present invention may additionally contain a 3'non-coding sequence. A "3'non-coding sequence" or "3'non-translated region" refers to a nucleotide sequence located 3' 25 (downstream) to a coding sequence and includes polyadenylation signal sequences and other sequences encoding regulatory signals capable of affecting the addition of polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3'end of the mRNA precursor. A 3'non-translated region comprises a region of the mRNA generally beginning with the translation termination codon and extending at least beyond the polyadenylation site. Non 30 translated sequences located in the 3' end of a gene have been found to influence gene expression levels. Ingelbrecht et al. (see, Plant Cell, 1:671-680, 1989) evaluated the importance of these elements and found large differences in expression in stable - 25 RTA01/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 plants depending on the source of the 3'non-translated region. Using 3'non translated regions associated with octopine synthase, 2S seed protein from Arabidopsis, small subunit of rbcS from Arabidopsis, extension from carrot, and chalcone synthase from Antirrhinium, a 60-fold difference was observed between the 5 best-expressing construct (which contained the rbcS 3'non-translated region) and the lowest-expressing construct (which contained the chalcone synthase 3'region). Transcription levels may also be increased by the utilization of enhancers in combination with the promoter regions of the invention. Enhancers are nucleotide sequences that act to increase the expression of a promoter region. Enhancers are 10 known in the art and include the SV40 enhancer region, the 35S enhancer element, and the like. In preparing the expression cassette, the various DNA fragments may be manipulated, so as to provide for the DNA sequences in the proper orientation and, as appropriate, in the proper reading frame. Toward this end, adapters or linkers may be 15 employed to join the DNA fragments or other manipulations may be involved to provide for convenient restriction sites. Restriction sites may be added or removed, superfluous DNA may be removed, or other modifications may be made to the sequences of the invention. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, restriction, annealing, resubstitutions, for example, transitions and transversions, may 20 be involved. Reporter genes or selectable marker genes may be included in the expression cassettes. Examples of suitable reporter genes known in the art can be found in, for example, Jefferson et al. (1991) in Plant Molecular Biology Manual, ed. Gelvin et al. (Kluwer Academic Publishers), pp. 1-33; DeWet et al. (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:725 25 737; Goff et al.

Other genes that could serve utility in the recovery of transgenic events but might not be required in the final product would include, but are not limited to, 10 examples such as GUS (b-glucoronidase; Jefferson (1987) Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 5:3 87), GFP (green florescence protein; Chalfie et al. (1994) Science 263:802), luciferase (Riggs et al. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15(19):8115 and Luehrsen et al. (1992) Methods Enzymol. 216:397-414), and the maize genes encoding for anthocyanin production (Ludwig et al. (1990) Science 247:449). 15 The nucleic acid molecules of the present invention are useful in methods directed to expressing a nucleotide sequence in a plant. This may be accomplished by transforming a plant cell of interest with an expression cassette comprising a promoter identified herein, operably linked to a heterologous nucleotide sequence, and regenerating a stably transformed plant from said plant cell. The methods of the 20 invention are also directed to selectively expressing a nucleotide sequence in a plant root. Those methods comprise transforming a plant cell with an expression cassette comprising a promoter identified herein that initiates root-preferred transcription in a plant cell, operably linked to a heterologous nucleotide sequence, and regenerating a transformed plant from said plant cell. 25 The expression cassette comprising the particular promoter sequence of the present invention operably linked to a nucleotide sequence of interest can be used to transform any plant. In this manner, genetically modified, i.e. transgenic or transformed, plants, plant cells, plant tissue, seed, root, and the like can be obtained. The present invention may be used for transformation of any plant species, 30 including, but not limited to, monocots and dicots.

(e.g., B. napus, B. rapa, B. juncea), particularly those Brassica species useful as sources of seed oil, alfalfa - 27 RTAOI/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 (Medicago sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), rye (Secale cereale), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, Sorghum vulgare), millet (e.g., pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), proso millet (Panicum miliaceum), foxtail millet (Setaria italica), finger millet (Eleusine coracana)), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), wheat (Triticum 5 aestivum), soybean (Glycine max), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), cotton (Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium hirsutum), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatus), cassava (Manihot esculenta), coffee (Coffea spp.), coconut (Cocos nucifera), pineapple (Ananas comosus), citrus trees (Citrus spp.), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), tea (Camellia sinensis), banana (Musa spp.), avocado 10 (Persea americana), fig (Ficus casica), guava (Psidium guajava), mango (Mangifera indica), olive (Olea europaea), papaya (Carica papaya), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), sugar beets (Beta vulgaris), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), oats, barley, vegetables, ornamentals, and conifers. 15 Vegetables include tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum), lettuce (e.g., Lactuca sativa), green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), lima beans (Phaseolus limensis), peas (Lathyrus spp.), and members of the genus Cucumis such as cucumber (C. sativus), cantaloupe (C. cantalupensis), and musk melon (C. melo). Ornamentals include azalea (Rhododendron spp.), hydrangea (Macrophylla hydrangea), hibiscus (Hibiscus 20 rosasanensis), roses (Rosa spp.), tulips (Tulipa spp.), daffodils (Narcissus spp.), petunias (Petunia hybrida), carnation (Dianthus caiyophyllus), poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima), and chrysanthemum. Conifers that may be employed in practicing the present invention include, for example, pines such as loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), slash pine (Pinus elliotii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), 25 and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata); Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); Western hemlock (Tsuga canadensis); Sitka spruce (Picea glauca); redwood (Sequoia sempervirens); true firs such as silver fir (Abies amabilis) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea); and cedars such as Western red cedar (Thujaplicata) and Alaska yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis). Optimally, plants of the present invention 30 are crop plants (for example, corn, alfalfa, sunflower, Brassica, soybean, cotton, safflower, peanut, sorghum, wheat, millet, tobacco, etc.), more optimally corn and soybean plants, yet more optimally corn plants. - 28 RTAOI/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 This invention is particularly suitable for any member of the monocot plant family including, but not limited to, maize, rice, barley, oats, wheat, sorghum, rye, sugarcane, pineapple, yams, onion, banana, coconut, and dates. As used herein, "vector" refers to a DNA molecule such as a plasmid, cosmid, 5 or bacterial phage for introducing a nucleotide construct, for example, an expression cassette, into a host cell. Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites at which foreign DNA sequences can be inserted in a determinable fashion without loss of essential biological function of the vector, as well as a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and 10 selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Marker genes typically include genes that provide tetracycline resistance, hygromycin resistance, ampicillin resistance, or glyphosate resistance. The methods of the invention involve introducing a nucleotide construct into a plant. By "introducing" is intended to mean to present to the plant the nucleotide 15 construct in such a manner that the construct gains access to the interior of a cell of the plant. The methods of the invention do not depend on a particular method for introducing a nucleotide construct to a plant, only that the nucleotide construct gains access to the interior of at least one cell of the plant. Methods for introducing nucleotide constructs into plants are known in the art including, but not limited to, 20 stable transformation methods, transient transformation methods, and virus-mediated methods. By "transient transfoniation" is intended to mean that a nucleotide construct introduced into a plant does not integrate into the genome of the plant. By "stable transformation" is intended to mean that the nucleotide construct introduced into a 25 plant integrates into the genome of the plant and is capable of being inherited by progeny thereof. By "primary transformant" and "TO generation" transgenic plants that are of the same genetic generation as the tissue that was initially transformed (i.e., not having gone through meiosis and fertilization since transformation) are intended. "Secondary transformants" and the "T1, T2, T3, and subsequent generations" refer to 30 transgenic plants derived from primary transformants through one or more meiotic and fertilization cycles. They may be derived by self-fertilization of primary or - 29 RTAO1/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 secondary transformants or crosses of primary or secondary transformants with other transformed or untransformed plants. The nucleotide constructs of the invention may be introduced into plants by contacting plants with a virus or viral nucleic acids. Generally, such methods involve 5 incorporating a nucleotide construct of the invention within a viral DNA or RNA molecule. Methods for introducing nucleotide constructs into plants and expressing a protein encoded therein, involving viral DNA or RNA molecules, are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,889,191, 5,889,190, 5,866,785, 5,589,367, and 5,316,931; herein incorporated by reference. 10 Transformation protocols as well as protocols for introducing nucleotide sequences into plants may vary depending on the type of plant or plant cell, i.e., monocot or dicot, targeted for transformation. Suitable methods of introducing nucleotide sequences into plant cells and subsequent insertion into the plant genome include microinjection (Crossway et al. (1986) Biotechniques 4:320-334), 15 electroporation (Riggs et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:5602-5606, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,981,840 and 5,563,055), direct gene transfer (Paszkowski et al. (1984) EMBO J 3:2717-2722), and ballistic particle acceleration (see, for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,945,050; 5,879,918; 5,886,244; and 5,932,782; Tomes et al.

(1996) Nature Biotechnology 14:745-750 (maize via Agrobacterium tumefaciens); all of which are herein incorporated by 10 reference. In specific embodiments, the heterologous sequence of interest can be provided to a plant using a variety of transient transformation methods. Such transient transformation methods include, but are not limited to, the introduction of the heterologous protein or variants and fragments thereof directly into the plant or 15 the introduction of the a heterologous transcript into the plant. Such methods include, for example, microinjection or particle bombardment. See, for example, Crossway et al. (1986) Mol Gen. Genet. 202:179-185; Nomura et al. (1986) Plant Sci. 44:53-58; Hepler et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91: 2176-2180 and Hush et al. (1994) The Journal of Cell Science 107:775-784, all of which are herein incorporated by 20 reference. Alternatively, the heterologous polynucleotide of interest can be transiently transformed into the plant using techniques known in the art. Such techniques include viral vector system and the precipitation of the polynucleotide in a manner that precludes subsequent release of the DNA. Thus, the transcription from the particle-bound DNA can occur, but the frequency with which its released to 25 become integrated into the genome is greatly reduced. Such methods include the use particles coated with polyethylimine (PEI; Sigma #P3143). Methods are known in the art for the targeted insertion of a polynucleotide at a specific location in the plant genome. In one embodiment, the insertion of the polynucleotide of interest at a desired genomic location is achieved using a site 30 specific recombination system. See, for example, W099/25821, W099/25854, W099/25840, W099/25855, and W099/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Briefly, the heterologous polynucleotide of interest can be contained in -31 RTA1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 transfer cassette flanked by two non-recombinogenic recombination sites. The transfer cassette is introduced into a plant having stably incorporated into its genome a target site which is flanked by two non-recombinogenic recombination sites that correspond to the sites of the transfer cassette. An appropriate recombinase is 5 provided and the transfer cassette is integrated at the target site. The polynucleotide of interest is thereby integrated at a specific chromosomal position in the plant genome. The cells that have been transformed may be grown into plants in accordance with conventional ways. See, for example, McConnick et al. (1986) Plant Cell 10 Reports 5:81-84. These plants may then be grown, and either pollinated with the same transformed strain or different strains, and the resulting hybrid having root preferred expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations may be grown to ensure that root-preferred expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited and then seeds harvested 15 to ensure root-preferred expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic has been achieved. Thus as used herein, "transformed seeds" refers to seeds that contain the nucleotide construct stably integrated into the plant genome. Several methods are available to assess promoter activity using both transient and stable transformation methods. Expression cassettes may be constructed with a 20 marker such as a visible marker. Using transformation methods such as microprojectile bombardment, Agrobacterium transformation or protoplast transformation, expression cassettes are delivered to plant cells or tissues. Reporter gene activity, such as fl-glucuronidase activity, luciferase activity or GFP fluorescence is monitored over time after transformation, for example 2 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 16 25 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after DNA delivery using methods well known in the art. Reporter gene activity may be monitored by enzymatic activity, by staining cells or tissue with substrate for the enzyme encoded by the reporter gene or by direct visualization under an appropriate wavelength of light. Full-length promoter sequences, deletions and mutations of the promoter sequence 30 may be assayed and their expression levels compared. Additionally, RNA levels may be measured using methods well known in the art, such as, Northern blotting, competitive reverse transcriptase PCR and RNAse protection assays. These assays - 32 RTA1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 measure the level of expression of a promoter by measuring the "steady state" concentration of a standard transcribed reporter mRNA. This measurement is indirect since the concentration of the reporter mRNA is dependent not only on its synthesis rate, but also on the rate with which the mRNA is degraded. Therefore the steady 5 state level is the product of synthesis rates and degradation rates. The rate of degradation can however be considered to proceed at a fixed rate when the transcribed sequences are identical, and thus this value can serve as a measure of synthesis rates. Further confirmation of promoter activity is obtained by stable transformation of the promoter in an expression cassette comprising a visible marker or gene of 10 interest into a plant as described above. Using the various methods described above such as enzymatic activity assays, RNA analysis and protein assays, promoter activity may be monitored over development, and additionally monitored in different tissues in the primary transformants and through subsequent generations of transgenic plants. The invention provides compositions for screening compounds that modulate 15 expression within roots of embryos and plants, and within root nodules. The vectors, cells, and plants can be used for screening candidate molecules for agonists and antagonists of the CRWAQ81 promoter. For example, a reporter gene can be operably linked to a CRWAQ81 promoter and expressed as a transgene in a plant. Compounds to be tested are added and reporter gene expression is measured to 20 determine the effect on promoter activity. Throughout the specification the word "comprising," or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps. 25 The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. EXAMPLES Example 1: Identification of the EST, CRWAQ81 30 The expressed sequence tag (EST) named CRWAQ81 was first identified using a proprietary sequence analysis program. This program contained an algorithm that allowed ESTs from all proprietary root-related maize libraries to be compared to - 33 RTAO1/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 ESTs from all proprietary non-root maize libraries. ESTs, or groupings of overlapping ESTs referred to as contigs, which were returned by the program, were identified as root preferred or potentially root specific. The EST named CRWAQ81 was identified in a root-preferred contig 5 comprised of 13 unique ESTs, 11 of which were from root libraries. Eight of those 11 were from a root library synthesized from 2-3 day old germinating seedlings and the remaining 3 were from a root library generated from western corn rootworm (WCRW) infested V5-stage plants (V5-stage plants have 5 collared leaves). The 2 non-root ESTs were from shoot libraries made from 2-3 day old seedlings. The EST 10 CRWAQ81 was selected for further characterization because it comprised all but approximately 78bp of the 703bp contig. Further evidence that the CRWAQ81 EST is root-preferred was obtained using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing technology (MPSS) (see, Brenner, et al. (2000) Nature Biotechnology 18:630-634 and Brenner et al. (2000) Proc. NatL. 15 Acad. Sci. USA 97:1665-1670). This technology involves the generation of 17 base signature tags from mRNA samples that have been reverse transcribed. The tags are simultaneously sequenced and assigned to genes or ESTs. The abundance of these tags is given a numeric value that is nonnalized to parts per million (PPM) which then allows the tag expression, or tag abundance, to be compared across different tissues. 20 Thus, the MPSS platform can be used to determine the expression pattern of a particular gene and its expression level in different tissues. The sequence of the CRWAQ81 EST was entered into the MPSS database and the signature tag was identified starting approximately 247 bases upstream of the poly(A) site. The tag was found to be in root libraries at levels averaging an adjusted 25 PPM of 2126. This level is comparable to the maize ubiquitin gene, which had an adjusted PPM value of 2916. The maize ubiquitin gene is considered to be a highly expressed gene and therefore was used as a reference to compare expression levels. These results also indicated that the CRWAQ81 EST is root-preferred. The tag for CRWAQ81 was found in 2 non-root libraries in the MPSS database, specifically an 30 endosperm library at an adjusted PPM of 3, and a leaf library at an adjusted PPM of 5. These PPM values indicated the level of expression in these tissues was essentially at - 34 RTA01/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 background. These data indicated that the gene for CRWAQ81 is root-preferred and expressed at relatively high levels. Example 2: CRWAQ81 Is Not Down-Regulated by WCRW Feeding 5 An important feature of a promoter directing expression of an insecticidal gene is that it is not down-regulated by insect feeding. For the CRWAQ81 gene, down regulation in response to WCRW feeding was tested. For testing, fluorescently labeled cRNA was generated from leaves, stems, nodal roots, and lateral roots of V6 stage plants (V6 stage plants have 6 collared leaves) and hybridized to an Affymetrix* 10 DNA microarray chip containing oligonucleotide probes of the CRWAQ81 EST. Results indicated that, in uninfested plants, CRWAQ81 was expressed at levels 240-fold higher in lateral roots than in leaves. The gene was also expressed at levels 240-fold greater in lateral roots than in stems. These results indicated that the CRWAQ8 1 gene is expressed at high levels in root tissues, but not in leaf or stem 15 tissue. Comparing lateral roots to nodal roots showed a less than two-fold difference in CRWAQ81 gene expression. Thus, between the two root types, there is virtually no difference in the CRWAQ81 gene expression level. When tissues were compared between WCRW infested and uninfested plants, virtually no differences in CRWAQ81 expression levels were found. In particular, a 20 less than two-fold difference in expression was detected between the roots of WCRW infested plants and the roots of uninfested plants. These results were supported by the MPSS platform, which showed there was only a 25% difference in CRWAQ81 expression levels between the roots of WCRW infested plants and uninfested plants. Thus, these data indicate that the gene for CRWAQ81 is not significantly down 25 regulated by WCRW feeding and remains at a high expression level. Materials and Methods Maize plants from the B73 line were grown under greenhouse conditions to V6-stage (6 collared leaves). Leaves (V6 leaf), stem (stalk), elongating nodal roots, 30 and adventitious lateral roots were harvested from WCRW infested and uninfested plants. For the WCRW infested plants, WCRW eggs were applied at a rate of 50 per -35 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 plant. This level of infestation produced roots that were damaged and scarred, but not decimated. RNA was extracted from approximately 200 mg of tissue using Trizol* reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PolyA+RNA (-1.0 Vtg) was isolated using 5 PolyATtract* mRNA Isolation System IV (Promega, Madison, WI). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II Plasmid System (Invitrogen). In vitro transcription labeling of cRNA with biotin conjugated ribonucleotides was performed with the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) followed by the QIAGEN, Inc. (Valencia, CA) RNeasy* mini protocol for RNA cleanup. The 10 resulting cRNA was fragmented and hybridized for 16 hours to a customized GeneChip* array of Zea mays oligonucleotides, then washed and stained with streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate, using the Affymetrix* GeneChip Fluidics Station. The Hewlett-Packard G2500A Gene Array Scanner and Affymetrix* GeneChip Analysis Suite software were used to analyze the results. 15 Example 3: Northern Analysis of CRWAQ81 Expression Northern blot analysis was performed to further demonstrate the spatial expression preference for the CRWAQ8 1 gene. RNA derived from leaves and whole ears of RI stage B73 maize plants (the R1 stage is identified by pollen-shed/silking) 20 were electrophoresed and blotted with RNA from leaves, stem, lateral and nodal roots of WCRW-infested and uninfested V6 stage B73 maize plants. The blot was hybridized with probes synthesized from the CRWAQ81 EST. No hybridization was observed in lanes containing leaf RNA from RI stage or WCRW-infested and uninfested V6 stage plants. Similarly, no hybridization was 25 observed in lanes containing RNA from R1 stage ears or V6 stage stems. Strong hybridization was only detected in lanes containing RNA from root tissue. This was independent of whether the roots were sampled from WCRW-infested or uninfested plants. These results provide further evidence that the CRWAQ81 gene is expressed at a high level, is root-preferred and is not down regulated by WCRW feeding. 30 Materials and Methods Maize plants from the line, B73, were grown under greenhouse conditions to the RI stage (pollen shed/silking). Leaves (leaf #11), whole ears (including husk, silk, - 36 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 and shank), and whole tassels (including anthers/pollen) were harvested. B73 plants were also grown to the V6 stage, infested with WCRW, and sampled as described in Example 2. Uninfested V6 stage plants were also sampled, as described in Example 2. RNA was extracted from the different tissues using Trizol* reagent (Invitrogen, 5 Carlsbad, CA). The RNA samples were electrophoresed through a standard formaldehyde gel. Afterwards, the gel was washed 2 times in 20X SSC for a total of 15 minutes, then blotted to a nylon membrane overnight in 1 OX SSC. The membrane was UV crosslinked for 2 minutes. Pre-hybridization of the blot totaled 2hrs at 42'C in 5X 10 SSC, 2% Blocking reagent for nucleic acid hybridization, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, 7% SDS, 50% Formamide (ULTRAhyb*, Ambion, Austin, TX). Single-stranded DNA probes were made from the CRWAQ81 EST by PCR. 50 ng of denatured probe was added per 1 ml of ULTRAhyb* solution. Hybridization was allowed to go overnight at 42'C in 10ml of solution. The next day the membrane was washed twice in 2X 15 wash solution (2X SSC containing 0.1% SDS) at room temperature for 15 minutes, and then washed twice in 0.5X wash solution (0.5X SSC containing 0.1% SDS) at 65'C for 15 minutes. Visualization of the CRWAQ8 1 transcripts was accomplished using the Genius System from Boehringer Mannheim. Briefly, the membrane was equilibrated 20 in Buffer 1 (100 mM Maleic Acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 minute, then put in blocking solution (1% Blocking reagent for nucleic acid hybridization in Buffer 1) for 1 hour. The membrane was incubated in anti-DIG-alkaline phosphate diluted 1:10,000 in blocking solution for 30 minutes and washed 2 times in Buffer 1 for a total of 15 minutes. After equilibration in Buffer 3 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM 25 NaCl, pH 9.5) for 2 minutes, twenty drops of CSPD (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, catalog no. 1755633) were applied to the membrane. It was covered with a plastic page protector and exposed to X-ray film overnight. Example 4: In situ Hybridization 30 In situ RNA hybridization experiments were performed according to the protocol set forth in Di Laurenzio et al. (1996) Cell 86:423-433, to determine the cell specific expression pattern of the CRWAQ81 gene in maize root tips. The -37 RTA01/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 hybridization experiments were performed in duplicate using embedded primary roots of maize seedlings grown on germination paper. An antisense probe and a sense probe were generated from the EST clone, CRWAQ81, using a PCR-based approach. Hybridization with antisense probes from the CRWAQ8 1 EST indicated that 5 the gene is almost ubiquitously expressed in maize root tips. Signal was detected in the epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and stele (pericycle and vascular tissue). Signal was not detected in the root cap, including the columella. Sense probes from the CRWAQ8 1 EST produced a similar hybridization pattern. While the intensity of the signal was relatively high, the level was less than observed with the antisense probe. 10 Example 5: Isolation of the Promoter for the CRWAQ81 Gene Analysis of the CRWAQ81 gene indicated it was expressed at high levels and in a root-preferred manner. Thus, the CRWAQ81 promoter could be used to direct high levels of expression in the roots of transgenic maize. A ~2. 1kb DNA fragment 15 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and a -3.6kb DNA fragment (SEQ ID NO: 2) of 5'flanking sequence was isolated using a combination of TAIL PCR (Liu et al. (1995) Plant J. 8:457-463) and ligation-mediated PCR (Universal GenomeWalker kit, Clontech). To define the putative 3' end of the promoter, 5' RACE (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was performed, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence 20 analysis of the RACE products revealed a single transcription start site approximately 34bp upstream of the putative CRWAQ81 coding region. This was corroborated by the position of a putative TATA signal (TATAAAAT) located at -25bp relative to the transcription start site. Further analysis of the 5' flanking sequence revealed 2 large imperfect tandem 25 repeats. The repeat most proximal to the transcription start site, designated as Repeat A2, is located at -500bp relative to the start site and is approximately 745bp in length. The repeat distal to the start site, designated as Repeat Al, is located at -1368bp and is approximately 738bp in length. Located in the CRWAQ81 promoter are sequences with significant similarity 30 to miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). MITEs are short transposable elements ranging in size from 125-500bp that have been found in the non-coding regions of maize genes, including promoters (Wessler et al. (1995) - 38 RTAOI/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Current Opinion in Genetics & Development 5: 814-821). While MITE biology continues to be studied, one present school of thought considers MITES to play important roles such as providing regulatory sequences, like a TATA box or a transcription start site, or the like. Interestingly, 2 of the MITEs in the CRWAQ81 5 promoter region share homology to MITEs found in 2 other maize promoters. The MITE sequence most proximal to the CRWAQ8 1 coding region is located at -408, relative to the transcription start site. It has 77% nucleotide identity to a MITE sequence found in the Zea mays P-gene promoter (Derwent GeneSeq Accession No. AAV3243 8). The other 2 MITE sequences, designated MITE 1 and 10 MITE2, overlap each other. MITE 1 is located at -975 and has 79% identity to a MITE sequence in intron 3 of the Zea mays GapC4 gene (GenBank Accession No: X73152). MITE2, located at -948, has 65% identity to a MITE sequence in the promoter of the maize 22kd alpha zein gene (GenBank Accession No: X61085). 15 Example 6: Promoter Activity of CRWAQ8 1 To demonstrate that the DNA fragments isolated as the CRWAQ81 promoter function as a promoter, a series of transient assays were performed. These assays provided a rapid assessment of whether the DNA fragment tested is able to direct gene expression. The -2.lkb promoter fragment (SEQ ID NO: 1), a component of the 20 -3.6kb promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2), was introduced into an expression cassette housing the p-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. Biolistic bombardment of root tissue from 5-day-old maize seedlings with this expression cassette resulted in the appearance of blue foci upon histochemical GUS staining. This indicated that the CRWAQ81 promoter fragment was able to direct gene expression. 25 Promoter activity was further demonstrated in transient assays using immature embryos and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation according to the protocol set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,981,840. During the cocultivation process with Agrobacterium, transient expression can be detected, even from some tissue-preferred promoters, e.g. from root-preferred promoters. For the ~2.1kb CRWAQ81 promoter 30 fragment, immature embryos were stained for GUS activity after 2 days and 5 days cocultivation. At 2 days, no GUS staining was observed. However, at 5 days low levels of punctate GUS staining were observed on the outer edges of the scutellum - 39 RTAOI/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 surrounding the embryo. This confirmed promoter activity, as negative controls lacked staining at both time points. Materials and Methods B73 seeds were placed along one edge of growth paper soaked in a solution of 5 7% sucrose. An additional piece of growth paper identical in size to the first was also soaked in 7% sucrose and overlaid onto the seeds. The growth paper - seed - growth paper sandwich was subsequently jelly rolled with the seed edge at the top of the roll, The roll was directionally placed into a beaker of 7% sucrose solution with the seeds at the top to allow for straight root growth. Seeds were allowed to germinate and 10 develop for 2-3 days in the dark at 27-28'C. Prior to bombardment the outer skin layer of the cotyledon was removed and seedlings were placed in a sterile petri dish (60 mm) on a layer of Whatman #1 filter paper moistened with 1 ml of H20. Two seedlings per plate were arranged in opposite orientations and anchored to the filter paper with a 0.5% agarose solution. 2-3 cm root tip sections were also excised from 15 seedlings and arranged lengthwise in the plates for bombardment. DNA/gold particle mixtures were prepared for bombardment in the following method. Sixty mg of 0.6 - 1.0 micron gold particles were pre-washed with ethanol, rinsed with sterile distilled H 2 0, and resuspended in a total of 1 ml of sterile H20. 50 tl aliquots of gold particle suspension were stored in siliconized Eppendorf tubes at 20 room temperature. DNA was precipitated onto the surface of the gold particles by combining, in order, 50 .tl aliquot of pre-washed 0.6 pM gold particles, 5-10 pg of test DNA, 50 pl 2.5 M CaC1 2 and 25 1Ll of 0.1 M spermidine. The solution was immediately vortexed for 3 minutes and centrifuged briefly to pellet the DNA/gold particles. The DNA/gold was washed once with 500 pil of 100% ethanol and 25 suspended in a final volume of 50 pl of 100% ethanol. The DNA/gold solution was incubated at -20"C for at least 60 minutes prior to aliquoting 6 pl of the DNA/gold mixture onto each mylar macrocarrier. Seedlings prepared as indicated above and excised root tips were bombarded twice using the PDS-1000/He gun at 1100 psi under 27-28 inches of Hg vacuum. The 30 distance between macrocarrier and stopping screen was between 6-8 cm. Plates were incubated in sealed containers for 24 h in the dark at 27-28' C following bombardment. -40 RTA01/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 After 18 - 24 h of incubation the bombarded seedlings and root tips were assayed for transient GUS expression. Seedlings and excised roots were immersed in 10 -15 mls of assay buffer containing 100 mM NaH 2

 -H 
 2 0 (pH 7.0), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM K 4 Fe(CN) 6 -3H 2 0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro 5 3-indoyl glucuronide. The tissues were incubated in the dark for 24 h at 37'C. Replacing the GUS staining solution with 100% ethanol stopped the assay. GUS expression/staining was visualized under a microscope. Example 7: Expression Pattern of CRWAQ81 10 Stable transformed plants were created to allow for a more detailed characterization of promoter activity, including expression pattern, expression level, and temporal regulation of the promoter. Calli stably transformed with expression cassettes containing the 2. 1kb CRWAQ81 promoter fragment (SEQ ID NO:1) operably connected to the GUS gene 15 (abbreviated as CRWAQ81:GUS) or the -2.1kb CRWAQ8 1 promoter fragment operably linked to the Adh1 intron and the GUS gene (abbreviated as CRWAQ8 1 (Adh1 intron1):GUS) were histochemically stained for GUS activity. The Adh1 intron was included for the purpose of increased expression as it has been shown that in cereal cells the expression of foreign genes is enhanced by the presence 20 of an intron in gene constructs (See, Callis et al. (1987) Genes and Development 1: 1183-1200 and Kyozuka et al. (1990) Maydica 35:353-357). Results from histochemical staining revealed a small number of callus events expressing GUS. The presence of the AdI1 intron increased the number of expressing events by a factor of 3. Most of the staining was localized to the somatic embryos, however, some callus 25 staining was observed. These results support the transient assay results and demonstrate that the CRWAQ81 promoter fragment directs gene expression in callus events. Leaf and root tissue from regenerated plants growing on nutrient agar were histochemically assayed for GUS activity. A few CRWAQ8 1:GUS events stained for 30 GUS and most events transformed with the CRWAQ81(Adhl intronl):GUS vector expressed GUS. This indicated that the -2.1kb CRWAQ81 promoter fragment was active. In both cases, however, expression tended to be low. The expression pattern directed by the -2.1kb CRWAQ81 promoter fragment in regenerated plants was -41 RTA01/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 primarily root-preferred. Much of the expression was in the mature regions of the root (>1cm from the root tip) and spatially split between 2 types of expression: ubiquitous expression in all cell types and localized expression in the vascular cylinder. In the root tip (the first lcm), no expression was detected. Nor was expression detected in 5 emerging lateral roots (<1cm in length). Factors such as developmental stage may affect expression from this promoter fragment. Evidence for this hypothesis stems from two observations. First, the ~2.1kb CRWAQ81 promoter fragment appears to be more active in V5-stage (5 collared leaves) greenhouse plants. Of 10 CRWAQ8 1:GUS transformation events sent to the 10 greenhouse for potting in soil, only 3 were GUS positive in tissue culture (i.e., growing on nutrient agar). When the same plants were assayed at the V5-stage in the greenhouse, 9 of the 10 were GUS positive. A similar phenomenon was observed in CRWAQ8 1 (Adh1 intronl):GUS events, but to a lesser extent as most of the plants initially sent to the greenhouse for potting in soil were already GUS positive. The 15 increased expression is not likely a result of increased GUS accumulation caused by low turnover of the GUS protein because an experiment looking at a group of CRWAQ81:GUS and CRWAQ81(Adhl intronl):GUS plants at V5-stage, and then again at R1 stage showed no difference in staining level. In addition, an examination of the Lynx MPSS database showed an incremental increase in expression of the 20 CRWAQ81 gene between V2- and Ri-stage. Specifically, the adjusted PPM value at V2-stage was 944. At V6 stage, the adjusted PPM value was near 1772, and at R1 stage the adjusted PPM value was 2870. Thus, the increased expression in older plants may be a result of temporal regulation of the CRWAQ81 promoter fragment. The spatial pattern of expression remained root-preferred in V5-stage plants. For 25 CRWAQ81:GUS events, expression was ubiquitous in the mature regions of the root. No expression was observed in root tips (the first 1cm) or in the emerging lateral roots (<1cm in length). Few events had staining in the leaves. The expression pattern in CRWAQ81(Adhl intronl):GUS events, however, was noticeably different. Expression was ubiquitous in the mature regions of the root. Expression was also 30 observed in the root cap and weakly in the region of elongation of some events. Approximately 50% of the events showed some level of expression in the leaf vasculature. The reason for the ectopic expression is unclear. Expression in the silks - 42 RTA/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 at RI-R2 stage was also examined (at R2 stage the silks are protruding from the end of the ear and are beginning to dry out and darken in color). None of the events assayed showed expression. This included events both with and without the Adh1 intron. No GUS expression was observed in pollen. Again, this was true whether the 5 Adhi intron was present or not. In the tassels, essentially no expression was observed in the glumes or rachis of CRWAQ8 1:GUS plants. Weak staining was observed in the glumes and rachis of a few CRWAQ81(Adh1 intronl):GUS plants. However, the most significant difference between the CRWAQ81:GUS and CRWAQ81(AdhI intronl):GUS tassels was the observed staining in the tissues near the lodicules. In 10 CRWAQ81(A dhl intronl):GUS plants, most of the events had some level of GUS staining. Without the intron, only a few events stained in this region. Materials and Methods Histochemical Staining of Calli and Plant Tissues for GUS Activity 15 GUS activity was evaluated in the root cap, the meristem, region of elongation, and mature regions of excised roots. Leaf sections excised from near the tip of the youngest collared leaf were also evaluated. Detection of GUS activity was accomplished by placing tissue from regenerated transformed plants into 48-well plates containing 0.5ml GUS assay buffer (assay buffer recipe described in Example 20 6) or in the case of greenhouse-grown plants, a 12-well plate containing 2ml GUS assay buffer. Plates were placed under house vacuum for 10min, then incubated in the dark at 37'C overnight. Tissue was cleared of pigmentation with 2 successive l2hr incubations in 100% ethanol at room temperature. The tissues were stored in 70% ethanol at 4'C. 25 Staining of excised silks and tassel branches was similar to leaf and root tissue except that the tissues were placed in 6-well plates containing 3-5 mls of GUS assay buffer. The tissues were cleared of pigmentation, as described above. Histochemical GUS staining of calli was performed as described for immature embryos in Example 6. - 43 RTAO1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Example 8: Transformation of Maize by Particle Bombardment and Regeneration of Transgenic Plants Immature maize embryos from greenhouse donor plants are bombarded with 5 DNA molecules containing a promoter of the invention operably linked to a gene of interest. A selectable marker is provided in the same transformation vector, or alternatively, the selectable marker gene is provided on a separate DNA molecule. Transformation is performed as follows. Media recipes follow below. 10 Preparation of Target Tissue The ears are husked and surface sterilized in 30% CloroxTM bleach plus 0.5% Micro detergent for 20 minutes, and rinsed two times with sterile water. The immature embryos are excised and placed embryo axis side down (scutellum side up), 25 embryos per plate, on 560Y medium for 4 hours and then aligned within the 2.5 15 cm target zone in preparation for bombardment. Preparation of DNA A plasmid vector comprising a promoter sequence of the invention is made. The vector additionally contains a PAT selectable marker gene driven by a CaMV35S 20 promoter and includes a CaMV35S tenninator. Optionally, the selectable marker can reside on a separate plasmid. A DNA molecule comprising a promoter sequence of the invention as well as a PAT selectable marker is precipitated onto 1.1 gm (average diameter) tungsten pellets using a CaCl 2 precipitation procedure as follows: 100 pl prepared tungsten particles in water 25 10 j1 (1 tg) DNA in Tris EDTA buffer (1 ptg total DNA) 100 pl 2.5 M CaC12 10 pl 0.1 M spermidine Each reagent is added sequentially to a tungsten particle suspension, while maintained on the multitube vortexer. The final mixture is sonicated briefly and 30 allowed to incubate under constant vortexing for 10 minutes. After the precipitation period, the tubes are centrifuged briefly, liquid removed, washed with 500 ml 100% ethanol, and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Again the liquid is removed, and 105 pl - 44 RTA01/2165723vl 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 100% ethanol is added to the final tungsten particle pellet. For particle gun bombardment, the tungsten/DNA particles are briefly sonicated and 10 p1l spotted onto the center of each macrocarrier and allowed to dry about 2 minutes before bombardment. 5 Particle Gun Treatment The sample plates are bombarded at level #4 in particle gun #HE34-1 or #HE34-2. All samples receive a single shot at 650 PSI, with a total of ten aliquots taken from each tube of prepared particles/DNA. 10 Subsequent Treatment Following bombardment, the embryos are kept on 560Y medium for 2 days, then transferred to 560R selection medium containing 3 mg/liter Bialaphos, and subcultured every 2 weeks. After approximately 10 weeks of selection, selection 15 resistant callus clones are transferred to 288J medium to initiate plant regeneration. Following somatic embryo maturation (2-4 weeks), well-developed somatic embryos are transferred to medium for germination and transferred to a lighted culture room. Approximately 7-10 days later, developing plantlets are transferred to 272V hormone free medium in tubes for 7-10 days until plantlets are well established. Plants are then 20 transferred to inserts in flats (equivalent to 2.5" pot) containing potting soil and grown for 1 week in a growth chamber, subsequently grown an additional 1-2 weeks in the greenhouse, then transferred to classic 600 pots (1.6 gallon) and grown to maturity. Plants are monitored and scored for expression by assays known in the art, such as, for example, immunoassays and western blotting with an antibody that binds to the 25 protein of interest.

Example 9: Agrobacteriuin-Mediated Transformation of Maize and Regeneration of Transgenic Plants 25 For Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of maize with a promoter sequence of the invention, optimally the method of Zhao is employed (U.S. Patent No. 5,981,840, and PCT patent publication W098/32326; the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). Briefly, immature embryos are isolated from maize and the embryos contacted with a suspension of Agrobacteriun under conditions whereby the bacteria 30 are capable of transferring the promoter sequence of the invention to at least one cell of at least one of the immature embryos (step 1: the infection step). In this step the immature embryos are optimally immersed in an Agrobacterium suspension for the initiation of inoculation. The embryos are co-cultured for a time with the - 46 RTAO1/2165723v1 35718/283375 WO 2005/035770 PCT/US2004/033513 Agrobacterium (step 2: the co-cultivation step). Optimally the immature embryos are cultured on solid medium following the infection step. Following this co-cultivation period an optional "resting" step is contemplated. In this resting step, the embryos are incubated in the presence of at least one antibiotic known to inhibit the growth of 5 Agrobacterium without the addition of a selective agent for plant transformants (step 3: resting step). Optimally the immature embryos are cultured on solid medium with antibiotic, but without a selecting agent, for elimination of Agrobacterium and for a resting phase for the infected cells. Next, inoculated embryos are cultured on medium containing a selective agent and growing transformed callus is recovered (step 4: the 10 selection step). Optimally, the immature embryos are cultured on solid medium with a selective agent resulting in the selective growth of transformed cells. The callus is then regenerated into plants (step 5: the regeneration step), and optimally calli grown on selective medium are cultured on solid medium to regenerate the plants.
