   FIELD OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0002]
      This invention relates to a process for preparing glycolic acid from an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate. More specifically, reactive solvent extraction is used to obtain glycolic acid from an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate.  
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0003]
      Glycolic acid (HOCH 2 COOH; CAS Registry Number is 79-14-1) is the simplest member of the α-hydroxy acid family of carboxylic acids. Its properties make it ideal for a broad spectrum of consumer and industrial applications, including use in water well rehabilitation, the leather industry, the oil and gas industry, the laundry and textile industry, and as a component in personal care products like skin creams. Glycolic acid also is a principal ingredient for cleaners in a variety of industries (dairy and food processing equipment cleaners, household and institutional cleaners, industrial cleaners [for transportation equipment, masonry, printed circuit boards, stainless steel boiler and process equipment, cooling tower/heat exchangers], and metals processing [for metal pickling, copper brightening, etching, electroplating, electropolishing]). New technology to commercially produce glycolic acid would be eagerly received by industry.  
     
    
    [0004]
      Various methods for preparing α-hydroxy acids are known. Fermentative production of an α-hydroxy acid using the corresponding α-hydroxy nitrile as the starting material is known in the art. Examples of α-hydroxy acids produced via fermentation include: glycolic acid, lactic acid, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid, 2-hydroxy-2-phenyl propionic acid, mandelic acid, 2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-4-butyrolactone, and 4-methylthiobutyric acid. These products are synthesized using microorganisms, such as those belonging to the genera  Nocardia, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Aureobacterium, Pseudomonas, Caseobacter, Alcaligenes, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Arthrobacter, Escherichia, Micrococcus, Streptomyces, Flavobacterium, Aeromonas, Mycoplana, Cellulomonas, Erwinia, Candida, Bacteridium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cochliobolus, Fusarium, Rhodopseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, Microbacterium, Obsumbacterium  and  Gordona .

       Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) is characterized by aliphatic nitrilase (EC 3.5.5.7) activity, as well as a combination of nitrile hydratase (EC 4.2.1.84) and amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) activities. The gene encoding the  A. facilis  72W (ATCC 55746) nitrilase has been cloned and recombinantly expressed (WO 01/75077 corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,870,038 and Chauhan et al.,  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,  61:118-122 (2003)). The  A. facilis  72W nitrilase converts α-hydroxynitriles to the corresponding α-hydroxycarboxylic acids in high yield (U.S. Pat. No. 6,383,786), including glycolic acid (U.S. Pat. No. 6,416,980).  
     
    
    [0006]
      Enzymatic conversion of glycolonitrile to glycolic acid using an enzyme catalyst (nitrilase or a combination of a nitrile hydratase and an amidase) typically results in the production of an aqueous solution of the ammonium glycolate. Many different methods have been suggested to convert the ammonium salt to free acid, such as the addition of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid (“acidification”). The glycolic acid thus obtained may be isolated by procedures such as concentration, precipitation, non-reactive solvent extraction, ion exchange, electrodialysis, thermal decomposition, distillation, and crystallization, to name a few. However, many of these conventional methods have limitations that are undesirable for industrial production such as 1) the use of low ammonium concentrations, 2) the generation of undesirable waste streams, 3) the use of expensive and difficult to operate processes (e.g., electrodialysis), or 4) the use of excessive amounts of energy. Conventional non-reactive solvent extraction is not a commercially viable option as the distribution coefficient for extracting the carboxylic acid into the organic phase may be very inefficient.  
     
    
    [0007]
      One method that has been used to isolate carboxylic acids is reactive extraction. This method has been reported to be useful for extracting lactic acid from ammonium lactate (Wasewar et al.,  J. Biotechnol.,  97:59-68 (2002)). Reactive extraction involves the use of a reactive organic solvent (i.e., an amine) to complex with the acid in the aqueous phase. The first step in the process typically involves acidification of the aqueous solution containing the salt of the desired acid. The acidified aqueous solution is then contacted with an organic solvent typically comprised of a reactive tertiary amine and one or more diluents. The reactive amine (typically a tertiary C8-C10 trialkylamine such as Alamine® 336, Cognis Corp, Cincinnati, Ohio) reacts with the carboxylic acid forming an acid/amine complex that is preferentially soluble in the organic phase (Tamada et al.,  Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.  29:1319-1326 (1990); Tamada et al.,  Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.  29:1327-1333 (1990)). The use of a tertiary alkylamine typically provides much higher distribution coefficients than would be obtainable with normal solvent extraction. Back extraction is then used to recover the acid from the organic phase.

      Inci, I. ( Chem. Biochem. Eng. Q.,  16(2):81-85 (2002); Inci, I. and Uslu, H.,  J. Chem. Eng. Data,  50:536-540 (2005)) report the use of reactive amine solvents for the extraction of glycolic acid. However, these experiments reported the extraction coefficients of pure glycolic acid dissolved in pure water. Inci does not illustrate or teach a process to obtain glycolic acid from a complex aqueous matrix (e.g., aqueous solutions of glycolic acid comprising significant amounts of mineral salts and other impurities), such as concentrated aqueous solutions of ammonium glycolate.  
     
    
    [0009]
      The problem to be solved is the lack of a process for obtaining glycolic acid from an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  
   
    
    [0022]
      The stated problem has been solved by providing an easy and efficient method to obtain glycolic acid from an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate. More specifically, an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate is first acidified. The resulting glycolic acid is extracted from the aqueous phase using reactive solvent extraction. The organic solvent is comprised of a tertiary amine and one or more diluents. The tertiary trialkyl amine (C8 to C12 alkyl groups) reacts with the glycolic acid, forming a glycolic acid:trialkylamine complex that is soluble in the organic phase. Back extraction into a second aqueous phase (“third phase”) is used to recover the acid from the glycolic acid-loaded organic phase.  
     
    
    [0023]
      Enzymatic conversion of an α-hydroxynitrile (e.g., glycolonitrile) to the corresponding α-hydroxyacid (e.g., glycolic acid) is well-known in the art. A nitrilase enzyme directly converts an aliphatic nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, without forming the corresponding amide as intermediate (Equation 1). A particularly useful and robust catalyst ( Acidovorax facilis  72W; ATCC 55746) has been used to convert glycolonitrile to glycolic acid in high yield (U.S. Pat. No. 6,416,980).  
                 
 
     
    
    [0024]
      Enzymatic conversion of a nitrile to an acid typically results in the production of an aqueous solution of the ammonium salt of the carboxylic acid (e.g., ammonium glycolate) as the reaction conditions are usually maintained at a pH where the predominant species is the ammonium salt of the desired acid (pH typically about 6 to about 8). A variety of methods can used to convert the ammonium salt of the acid into the purified carboxylic acid including, but not limited to techniques based on concentration, crystallization, ion exchange (cationic and/or anionic), eletrodialysis, thermal decomposition of the salt, distillation, and alcoholysis.  
     
    
    [0025]
      The present method uses reactive solvent extraction to obtain an aqueous solution glycolic acid from an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate. The aqueous solution of glycolic acid obtained by the present process has significantly fewer impurities (mineral salts, etc.). The substantially purified glycolic acid can be easily isolated using a variety of techniques known in the art.  
     
    
    [0026]
      The first step of the process involves the acidification of an aqueous ammonium glycolate solution to an aqueous solution that is predominantly glycolic acid. Typically, a mineral acid (e.g., H 2 SO 4 ) is added to the aqueous ammonium glycolate solution until the pH of the solution is about 3 or less (the pKa of glycolic acid is ˜3.83). The acidified aqueous solution is then contacted with a water-immiscible organic solvent solution (“first phase”) comprised of a tertiary trialkylamine and at least one diluent selected from the group consisting of methyl isobutyl ketone, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, methylene chloride, 1-chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, chloroform, kerosene, toluene, mixed xylenes, and tributyl phosphate. The tertiary trialkylamine (e.g., Alamine® 336) reacts with the acid, forming an acid/amine complex that is soluble in the organic phase. Back extraction with water is then used to produce a substantially purified aqueous solution of glycolic acid. Methods to isolate the substantially purified glycolic acid obtained after back extraction are well known in the art and may include, but are not limited to crystallization, ion exchange, eletrodialysis, and distillation. Optionally, the organic solvent phase is recycled.

      As used herein, the terms “water-immiscible organic solvent” and “first phase” are used to describe an organic solvent mixture comprising at least one tertiary trialkylamine having the formula:  
                 
 
     
    
    [0037]
      wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3  are independently a C8 to C12 alkyl group; and at least one diluent selected from the group consisting of methyl isobutyl ketone, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, methylene chloride, 1-chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, chloroform, kerosene, toluene, mixed xylenes, tributyl phosphate, and mixtures thereof.

    [0038]
      The concentration of tertiary trialkyl amine in the first phase may range from about 30 percent (vol/vol) to about 99 percent (vol/vol), preferably about 50 percent (vol/vol) to about 90 percent (vol/vol), and most preferably about 70 percent (vol/vol) to about 90 percent (vol/vol). The amount of diluent in the first phase may range from about 1 percent (vol/vol) to about 70 percent (vol/vol), preferably about 10 percent to about 50 percent, and most preferably about 10 to about 30 percent.  
     
    
    [0039]
      As used herein, the term “aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate” will be used to describe the aqueous reaction mixture comprising ammonium glycolate (typically having a pH of about 6 to about 8).  
     
    
    [0040]
      As used herein, the term “second phase” refers to an aqueous solution of glycolic acid having a pH of about 4 or less, preferably about 3 or less, and most preferably about 1 to about 2. The “second phase” is prepared by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate with a strong mineral acid, such as H 2 SO 4 . However, the addition of the strong acid increases the amount of mineral salts (an undesirable impurity) in the second phase. Extraction of the glycolic acid from the second phase into an organic phase (i.e. the first phase) separates the glycolic acid from the mineral salt impurities.  
     
    
    [0041]
      As used herein, the term “reactive extraction process” refers to the process of contacting (i.e., mixing) an aqueous solution of glycolic acid (i.e., second phase) with a water-immiscible organic solvent (i.e., first phase) whereby the glycolic acid reacts with the tertiary trialkylamine to form an glycolic acid:trialkylamine complex. The complex is soluble in the organic phase, thereby extracting glycolic acid from the aqueous phase (i.e., second phase comprising substantial amounts of impurities) into the organic phase, forming a “glycolic acid-loaded first phase”. The glycolic acid-loaded first phase is subsequently isolated from the aqueous second phase. A back extraction process is then used to extract the glycolic acid from the organic phase back into an aqueous phase (i.e. the “third phase”). The length of time and temperature used for the reactive extraction process may be adjusted to optimize the extraction efficiency. In one embodiment, the mixing period of the first and second phase is about 5 minutes to about 8 hours, preferably about 5 minutes to about 1 hour, more preferably about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes. The temperature may range from about 5° C. to about 90° C., more preferably about 25° C. to about 75° C., and most preferably about 25° C. to about 50° C.  
     
    
    [0042]
      As used herein, the term “back extraction process” refers to the process of contacting a water-immiscible organic solvent comprising glycolic acid (i.e. “glycolic acid-loaded first phase”) with water (i.e. “third phase”) to extract the glycolic acid from the organic phase into the aqueous phase. In one embodiment, the third phase is deionized water. After back extraction, the third phase comprises a substantially purified form of glycolic acid (substantially less mineral salts and other impurities). The glycolic acid in the third phase can be optionally isolated using a variety of techniques know in the art. The length of time and temperature used for the back extraction process may be adjusted to optimize the extraction efficiency. In one embodiment, the mixing period of the “glycolic acid-loaded first phase” and aqueous phase (i.e., third phase) is about 10 minutes to about 8 hours, preferably about 30 minutes to about 4 hours, more preferably about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes. Typically, the back extraction process occurs under pressurized conditions under a non-reactive gas (i.e., nitrogen) blanket. The pressure in the back extraction chamber may be varied but is typically less than about 100 psig (less than about 690 kPa). The temperature may range from about 5° C. to about 150° C., preferably about 100° C. to about 150° C., and most preferably about 125° C. to about 140° C.  
      Suitable Conditions for the Present Process  
     
    
    [0043]
      Solvent extraction may also be used to obtain glycolic acid from an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate. The concentration of ammonium glycolate in the aqueous solution is typically 5 wt % to about 90 wt %. In one embodiment, the concentration of ammonium glycolate is about 5 wt % to about 40 wt %. The aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate can comprise a reaction mixture resulting from the enzymatic hydrolysis of glycolonitrile that is unpurified or at least partially purified. The reaction mixture resulting from the enzymatic hydrolysis of glycolonitrile may also be comprised of other organic salts, inorganic salts, protein fragments, sugar residues, other organic acids, alcohols, ketones, and metal ions. The reaction mixture resulting from the enzymatic hydrolysis of glycolonitrile can be partially purified by filtration or centrifugation to remove excess debris or particulate matter that may result from the use of an unimmobilized cell or immobilized cell catalyst. In one embodiment, the feed stream may also be concentrated and/or acidified prior to being used as a feed stream in the present invention. The pH of the aqueous ammonium glycolate solution may range from about 5 to about 10, but is typically about 6 to about 8.  
     
    
    [0044]
      The first step in reactive solvent extraction is acidification (to a pH of about 4 or less, preferably a pH of about 0 to about 4, more preferably about 3 or less, and most preferably about 1 to about 2 of the aqueous ammonium glycolate solution with a strong acid, such a sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ). Lowering the pH of the ammonium glycolate solution creates an aqueous solution of glycolic acid (i.e., “second phase”) as the pKa of glycolic acid is about 3.83. This “second phase” typically is comprised of significant concentrations of ammonium and sulfate ions (undesirable impurities), creating a complex aqueous extract phase that may influence the overall reactive extraction process.  
     
    
    [0045]
      A water-immiscible organic solvent (i.e., “first phase”) is subsequently mixed with the second phase, and forms a two-phase system (a water immiscible organic phase and an aqueous phase). The glycolic acid in the second phase forms a complex with the tertiary trialkyl amine in the first phase. The complex has high solubility in the organic phase and low solubility in the aqueous phase, thereby extracting glycolic acid from the second (aqueous phase) into the first (organic phase), thereby forming a glycolic acid-loaded first phase. The partition coefficient of the glycolic acid can be calculated by measuring the wt % of the glycolic acid in the resulting loaded organic phase vs. the wt % of the remaining glycolic acid in the second phase.  
     
    
    [0046]
      A back extraction process is used to extract the glycolic acid from the glycolic acid-loaded first phase into a new aqueous phase (i.e., “third phase”). Typically, the glycolic acid-loaded first phase is isolated from the second phase (aqueous solution comprising glycolic acid and mineral salts). The loaded organic phase is subsequently contacted with a new aqueous phase (third phase). In one embodiment, the third phase is deionized water. During the back extraction process, glycolic acid from the organic phase is extracted back into an aqueous phase. The resulting aqueous solution of glycolic acid contains significantly fewer impurities compared to the water-soluble impurities (i.e., mineral salts) found in the acidified ammonium glycolate solution (i.e., second phase).  
     
    
    [0047]
      The substantially purified glycolic acid in the resulting aqueous phase can be isolated and purified using a variety of techniques well-known in the art including, but not limited to crystallization, distillation, etc.  
      Analytical Methods Use to Measure the Reactants and Products  
     
    
    [0048]
      A variety of analytical methods can be employed to analyze the reactants and products produced using the present methods include HPLC, GC, ion selective electrodes, MS, NMR, etc. HPLC was used to measure glycolic acid and various related products.

      Following the procedures in Example 1, into a 1-L cylindrical glass vessel on an extraction mixer (mix by rotating back and forth vertically) was placed 100 mL of a mixed solvent containing 70% (volume/volume) Alamine® 336 (Cognis), 10% (volume/volume) methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and 20% (volume/volume) kerosene. The pH of an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate (10 wt % to 50 wt %) was adjusted to approximately pH 2 to 3 with concentrated sulfuric acid, then 100 mL of the resulting aqueous solution was added to the extraction mixer. The resulting mixture was stirred for 60 minutes at room temperature. The mixing was stopped and the two phases allowed to separate, then the organic and aqueous phases were each sampled and analyzed for glycolic acid concentration by HPLC. The organic phase was collected and used in the back extraction. This organic phase containing glycolic acid is referred as “loaded solvent” below.

      Into a 85-mL pressure reaction glass tube (pressure reaction vessel, from Andrews Glass Co.) equipped with magnetic stir bar and double dip tubes was placed 10 mL deionized water and 10 mL of the loaded solvent. The vessel was then closed, and the headspace purged with nitrogen. The resulting mixture was stirred for 60 minutes at 120° C. under 40 psig (˜275.8 kPa) nitrogen. The stirring was stopped and the two phases allowed to separate at 120° C., then the organic phase was sampled under pressure through the top dip tube into a Hoke cylinder, and aqueous phases was sampled under pressure through the bottom dip tube into another Hoke cylinder. Both phases were analyzed for glycolic acid concentration by HPLC.
