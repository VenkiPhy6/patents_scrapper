 Background technique 
 Human intestine is considered in uterus being sterile, but it is immediately exposed to various mothers after birth
Body and environmental microorganism.Then, colonisation and the procreation of dynamic time section occurs, this is influenced by factor such as below:
Childbirth options, environment, diet and host gene type, all these all influence the composition of intestinal microbiota, in the primordial growth traits phase
Between it is especially true.Then, micropopulation stabilizes and becomes mature [1].Human intestinal microorganisms group is containing more than 1500 kinds
Different phylotype, the main division bacteria of two of them (door) occupy leading position on abundance level: Bacteroidetes and thickness
Wall bacterium door [2-3].Various metabolism, knot have been generated by the successful symbiosis that the bacterial colonisation of human intestine generates
Structure, protectiveness and other beneficial functions.The metabolic activity of the enhancing for the enteron aisle settled down ensures otherwise to be difficult to digest
Dietary ingredient be degraded with the release of by-product, to provide important nutriment source and other strong for host
Health benefit.Similarly, the immunology importance of intestinal microbiota is fully recognized and is illustrated in germfree animal, described
Germfree animal has the compromised immune system [4-6] functionally reconstructed after introducing symbiotic bacteria. 
 The dynamic change of micropopulation composition has had in gastrointestinal disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) recorded.For example, shuttle
Bacterium (Clostridium) cluster XIVa and the horizontal of clostridium cluster XI (pula clostridium (F.prausnitzii)) bacterium suffer from IBD
It is reduced in person, and the quantity of Escherichia coli (E.coli) increases, to show what enteron aisle endosymbiosis biology and causal organism balanced
Change [7-11]. 
 After recognizing the potential positive effect that certain bacterium bacterial strains may have animal intestinal tract, it has been suggested that various
Bacterial strain is for treating various diseases (see, e.g. [12-15]).Having proposed a variety of bacterial strains (mainly includes lactobacillus
(Lactobacillus) and Bifidobacterium (Bifidobacterium) bacterial strain) for treat various enteropathies (for summary ginseng
See [16]).The bacterial strain of Blaw spy Bordetella (genus Blautia) has also been proposed for regulating and controlling the digestion ecology in IBS patient
