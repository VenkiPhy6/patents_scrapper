 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to medicine and microbiological art, exactly, is related to the composition for teeth caring and treatment.
Specifically, the present invention includes being used to treat and/or prevents peri-implantitiss and other imbalances with microbial ecological are relevant
The composition of oral conditions. 
 Background technology 
 The inflammatory lesion occurred in the tissue of bone regeneration around implant is referred to as bone regeneration around implant disease and including two kinds of disease
Sick entity：Catarrh and peri-implantitiss.Peri-implantitiss have similar sign with bone regeneration around implant catarrh, still
Crest of alveolar ridge bone loss (crestal bone loss) is not present in bone regeneration around implant catarrh.Catarrh is defined as planting
The reversible modification of implant surrounding soft tissue, no bone loss.Peri-implantitiss influence deep soft tissue and bone regeneration around implant on the contrary
Bone, and it be defined as by cause supportive bone lose forfeiture and mucosa irritation in the way of influence close to bone it is whole
Close the inflammatory process of the tissue of planting body.The prevalence rate of peri-implantitiss depends on being used for the clinical threshold value for defining prevalence rate,
Results of recent changes [Albertini, M. et al. 2014] between 6.6% and 47%. 
 One of the main reason for peri-implantitiss are implant failures.Having pointed out plaque accumulation and bacterium imbalance is
One of the main reasons, because there are positive correlation between plaque accumulation and crest of alveolar ridge bone loss.In peri-implantitiss,
The combination of bacterium, stress or both can stimulate the bone loss of bone regeneration around implant.Once bone loss increases and forms deep bag, just establish
The anaerobic atmosphere of the advantage of Anaerobic Bacteria will be strengthened.These become the main reason for continuing bone loss with that.
Show, the microorganism group of the microorganism group of the biomembrane around peri-implantitiss into the presence of different from healthy planting body
Into.Generally speaking, compared to the planting body of health, the ratio of beneficial bacteria species that reduces and increased is presented in lesion planting body
It is assumed that the ratio of pathogen.Some identifications from orange compound of higher proportion are usually presented in peri-implantitiss position
The periodontal pathogen gone out, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fusobacterium nucleatum) or middle Prey irrigate bacterium
(Prevotella intermedia).At these positions, there are other fastidious pathogen from red complex, including tooth
Gum Detection of Porphyromonas (Porphyromonas gingivalis), treponema denticola (Treponema denticola) and good fortune
Match stainer bacterium (Tannerella forsythia) [Da Silva, E.S.C. et al. 2013].In spite of very big dispute, but
It is it is believed that seeming with the other flat of unwrapping wire cohesion bacillus (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans)
Some horizontal periodontal pathogens are usually related with peri-implantitiss [Persson, G.R. et al. 2013]. 
 Because planting development the playing an important role for peri-implantitiss of biomembrane on tooth surface, treatment
It is mainly based upon the bacterial colonization reduced in implant surface or mechanically eliminates bacterial micro-organism clump.Operation is developed
This point is realized with No operation technology. 
 Surgical procedures are based on for reducing the resection technology of bag depth and fixed soft tissue form and based on by making
The regeneration techniques for carrying out guiding bone surgery is placed with bone.In general, these programs are of high cost, make patient feel pain
Or it is uncomfortable, therefore be only limited to as bone loss late period or even if providing initial prophylactic treatment, controlling when bone loss continues to
Treat selection.[Ata-Ali, J. et al. 2011]. 
 Therefore, selected as first-line treatment, No operation technology is preferable.In general, these technologies be related to
0.12% chlorhexidine (chlorhexidine) rinse liquid (such as 12 it is small when, 15 days by a definite date) and/or antibiosis prime form
Controlled by chemical plaque to eliminate plaque.However, the side effect of chlorhexidine is just well-known a long time ago.
Chlorhexidine can stimulate and destroy oral mucosa, cause the discoloration and dyeing of tooth and other oral surfaces, increase tooth
Dirt forms and changes taste perception.Also reported oral stimulation and local anaphylactic type symptom.In addition it there has been reported mucous membrane
Side effect, including stomatitis, gingivitis and ulcer.It is the antibacterial action because chlorhexidine that these are more active
Caused oral microorganism clump change [ Et al. L. 1971]. 
 Antibiotherapy can cause various side effects and drug interaction.For example, wide spectrum systemic antibiotics are even
The problem of changing symbiotic microorganism clump occurs in you, and antibiotic relevant disease can be caused by changing symbiotic microorganism clump, including difficult
The relevant colitis of clostridium (Clostridium difficile), diarrhea, vaginopathy, vaginitis etc..The use of antibiotic also has
Beneficial to the development of the resistance of bacterium, this can allow treatment to be given a discount and further treatment is become more troublesome [Slots, J.
Et al. 1990]. 
 Recent research has shifted towards probiotics, " microorganism living assigns host health benefit when being given by appropriate amount ".
Influence of the probiotics to oral health is relatively new, and many researchs are carrying out. 
 Oral cavity probiotics known in the market is lactobacillus reuteri (L.reuteri) Prodentis.Recent research refers to
Show, in most of chronic periodontitis, carry out dental care with the tablet containing probiotics strain lactobacillus reuteri and lure
Lead pro-inflammatory cytokine reaction substantially reduce and clinical parameter improve [Szkaradkiewicz, A.K. et al. 2014].Separately
The purpose of one research is that probiotics lozenge of the assessment containing lactobacillus reuteri is carried out as auxiliary in chronic periodontitis
Scrape the effect controlled with root planing (scaling and root planing, SRP).In the SRP groups by probiotics agents treatment
It was observed that porphyromonas gingivalis is reduced, but do not see that the other pathogens studied change [Teughels, W. et al.
2013].However, effect of the lactobacillus reuteri to oral cavity microbiotas is still problematic, because in parallel research, testing
The probiotics lozenge containing lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC55730 and ATCC PTA5289) is daily intaked during property gingivitis to seem
Plaque accumulation, the microorganism group of inflammatory states or biomembrane are not significantly affected into [Flallstroem, H. et al. 2013]. 
 Open Flichy-Fernandez, A.J. et al. 2015 is described containing bacterial strain lactobacillus reuteri ATCC in the recent period
The lactobacillus reuteri Prodentis probiotic tablets of PTA5289 and lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 glue bone regeneration around implant
The influence of film inflammation.12 bone regeneration around implant catarrh patients have been recruited in research, these patients continue to take probiotics tablets in 30 days
Agent.Compared to placebo, patient shows that gingival index declines, this is primarily due to inflammatory cytokine reduction.The document is not
It is related to effect of the lactobacillus reuteri to peri-implantitiss.Compared to catarrh, peri-implantitiss are characterized in that bone
Structural failure, this is primarily due to the effect of pathogen.Because the document does not describe probiotic tablet to peri-implantitiss
Or the effect to related pathogen, so whether probiotics is suitable for treatment peri-implantitiss and is still a problem. 
 Another example is a recent research, the study describes health young adult in orally administration contain
Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L.rhamnosus) GG and bifidobacterium animalis acid subspecies (B.animalis subsp.lactis) BB-
Influence of 12 lozenge to the amount of plaque, gingivitis and oral microorganism clump.Probiotics lozenge reduces plaque and subtracts
Small gingival index, but two groups of saliva microorganism group Cheng Jun finds no the change of probiotics induction.Conclusion is, with regard to gum
For inflammation, probiotics lozenge improves Periodontal Status, but does not influence oral microorganism clump [Toiviainen, A. et al.
2015]。 
 Other probiotics such as Lactobacillus brevis (Lactobacillus brevis) CD2 are had studied in periodontitis
Effect, but not yet prove the effect in peri-implantitiss and catarrh [Maekawa, T. et al. 2014]. 
 JP20100053062 discloses the oral cavity composition containing lactic acid bacteria, and the composition is suitable for prevention and/or controls
Treat mouth disease, including periodontosis and carious tooth.Specifically, it has proved that, belong to leuconostoc mesenteroide (Leuconostoc
Mesenteroides) bacterial strain of the bacterium of species has good aggregation and adhesive capacity, therefore can be attached on mucous membrane
And suppress pathogenic organisms film.Oral cavity composition can include bacterial strain and excipient, adhesive, lubricant and solubilizer, according to
Conventional method is prepared. 
 The recent review [Yanine, N. et al. 2013] of this area is drawn to draw a conclusion：Probiotics is on prevention and treatment
The validity of periodontosis is still problematic.Visited on main result and examine depth of pocket (probing pocket depth), do not deposited
Acted in the clinical benefit of probiotics.On secondary as a result, probiotics shows dental plaque index and gingivitis some benefit
Place.To sum up, from the prior art as it can be seen that probiotics can the helpful inflammation improved during periodontal and gum, it is but prebiotic
It is still a problem whether to have effect in the ecological disturbance that bacterium occurs during these, and ecological disturbance is in peri-implantitiss
The main reason for bone loss. 
 Another problem related with the effect of current therapy is that the technology and method for oral delivery probiotics have weight
Big limitation, these technologies and method include being incorporated in food, tablet, chewing gum, gel or toothpaste.These limitations include pair
The negative effect of the stability of probiotics and its trigger the ability of beneficial effect because its holdup time in the oral cavity is short and under
Drop.When probiotics must be delivered in cavity non-accessible in mouth, such as periodontal position is planted, this is one and chooses
War, it can cause probiotics for oral cavity pathogen, give a discount for preventing or treating the antagonistic activity of peri-implantitiss. 
 In addition, the plantation body region adjacent with bone usually contributes to the surface of a wound of planting body adhesion and Integrated implant, and
And it is after antibacterial therapy is carried out or contaminated, with the formation of subsequent further bone loss and bone regeneration around implant bag.
Done effort is colonized to manage the pathogenicity in these regions and achieves limited success.Because these regions it is non-accessible and
It is all smaller than most of brush head and other devices, so confirming teeth caring use very little.Systemic prevention effect is limited, because carefully
Bacterium is often gathered into rapidly protected cluster, adds the possibility of the bacterium of antibiotic resistance. 
 A kind of delivery system that probiotics can be delivered to desired specific oral cavity position is needed effectively to adjust mouth
Chamber microbiotas.Probiotics living, having metabolic activity should be able to be released slowly into oral cavity by delivery system, it is allowed to prebiotic
Bacterium is fully colonized at desired position, and holdup time long enough is to realize beneficial effect.

 The metabolic activity for reducing bacterial cell has two kinds of basic skills, and therefore, being post-processed also has two methods.First
Kind is the speed for reducing all chemical reactions, this can be by using refrigerator, mechanical freezers and liquid nitrogen frozen mechanism cold or cold
Freeze, reduce temperature to carry out.Alternatively, the material of cell growth can be inhibited bacteria by adding, i.e. bacteriostatic agent reduces allization
The speed of reaction is learned, bacteriostatic agent is abbreviated as Bstatic. 
 Second of method post-processed is to go to remove water from biomass, and this method may include to make water using lyophilizer
Distillation.The appropriate technology that water removal is gone from biomass is drying, freeze-drying, spray drying or fluidized bed drying.Produce solid
The post processing of form can be drying, freezing, freeze-drying, fluidized bed drying or spray drying. 
 Post processing is preferably freeze-dried, it is included by distilling under reduced pressure, from the bacterial suspension after freezing
Water removal.This method is made of three steps：For precooling product to form refrigerating structure, primary is dry to remove most of water,
And redrying combines water to remove.Because the manufacture of lyophilized bacterial cultures and the objective of separated industrial technology and
Expected variability, so lyophilized bacterial cultures usually contains a certain amount of inert filler, is also known as freeze drying protectant.Its
Effect is to make the content standard of the live probiotics in product.Use the following inert filler in commercially available lyophilized culture：Sucrose
(sucrose), sucrose (saccharose), lactose, trehalose, glucose, maltose, maltodextrin, cornstarch, synanthrin with
And other pharmaceutically acceptable non-hygroscopic fillers.Optionally, other stabilizers or cryoprotector are also used, it is such as anti-bad
Hematic acid, for forming sticky lotion, makes sticky lotion undergo freeze-drying.Under any circumstance, the material so obtained
