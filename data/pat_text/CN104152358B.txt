 Technical field 
 The present invention relates to a kind of microorganism fungus kind and its biological adsorption radionuclide technical field is applied to, specifically,
The technical field applied the present invention relates to a kind of radiation hardness mould and its in radionuclide absorption. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Strontium 90（ 90 Sr）It is that one kind of strontium element has radioactive isotope, is one of fission product of uranium, half-life period is
28.8.It is generally from nuclear explosion or nuclear fuel product.Strontium-90 can do Beta-ray radioactive source, there is sizable danger to human body
Evil, it is produced by uranium in nuclear test, is sucked by human body with the form of dust, and radiation damage is produced to human body. 
 Radioactive pollution is to cause human cancer, reproduction lesion, genetic block, senile dementia, the major reason of amnesia,
High dose radiation（>6.5Gy）Directly result in people dead；Low dose exposure（<1.5Gy）Damage, the destruction of inhereditary material can be caused
Candidate stem cell system and immune system etc., cause gene mutation and chromosome aberration, induce cancer.Meanwhile, inhereditary material
Variation can be inherited the next generation, cause newborn teratogenesis or serious congenital disorders.Radioactive pollution has become urgent solution
Significant problem certainly.In terms of radioactive pollution is administered, conventional method is engineering method, chemical method.Engineering method is physical
The method that ground is collected and isolates radioactive substance, chemical method is to be fixed and removed radioactive pollution using special chemicals.
Although the application that the above method has been succeeded, Hiroshima and Nagasaki Liang Ge cities, the republican ratio in the Marshall Islands such as Japan
The horse traction woods of Geordie reef atoll nuclear test site and Australia adds the reparation of nuclear test site and rebuilds, but its cost is very high, it is difficult to use
In the reparation of large area radiation area, therefore, engineering is very big with the method limitation of chemistry.Biological prosthetic is using special biology
Enrichment and the method for immobilization of radioactive pollutant, mainly microorganism and plant, particularly microbial function utilize of greatest concern,
Because of its low cost, it is suitable for large area repair, thus biological prosthetic radioactive pollution turns into the focus of current research. 
 Research shows：Microorganism not only can be by dissolving and the effect such as precipitation, biological adsorption and absorption, redox is controlled
Radionuclide contamination in reason environment, and can be by changing plant rhizosphere microenvironment, so as to improve plant heavy metal
The absorption of ion and radionuclide, the efficiency volatilized or fix.Related research also achieves actively progress, such as Jana
The researchs such as Sitte have shown that radioactive nucleus uranium（U）Mobility in soil is influenceed by microorganism in environment and envirment factor,
Eva-Maria Burkhardt researchs show that the hyperplasia of Fe (III) reducing bacteria is conducive to including the heavy metal ion including U by soil
Earth is migrated to underground water.Copplestone etc. separates acquisition and can largely accumulate 137 Cs、 238+239+240 The radionuclides such as Pu it is micro-
The research of biological bacterial strain, Hu etc. shows that many microorganisms can adsorb U, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa CSU,
Aspergillus fumigatus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.The research such as Entry finds to apply AM VA Mycorrhizal Fungis
Row plant pair can be promoted 137 Cs、 90 The accumulation of Sr, Oneidensis Shewanella MR-1 can effectively by soluble U 6+ 、Cr 6+ With
Tc 7+ It is reduced to insoluble U 5+ 、Cr 3+ And Tc 4+ 。 
 Following two aspects are must account for using the radioactive pollution environment of microorganism remediation:First, it is necessary to be strong resistance to
The microorganism of radiation;Second, public safety can not be threatened during microorganism remediation environment, secondary pollution can not be produced.Due to
Most bacterium is more sensitive to specific radioactivity, therefore the ability of their reparation radioactive pollution environment can be subject to larger limit
System.Accordingly, it would be desirable to go to separate the microorganism with radioresistance from natural environment, or transformed by technique for gene engineering
Some microorganisms are allowed to obtain radioresistance.The report of radiation-resistant fungus Adsorption of Radioactive nucleic is there is no at present.
