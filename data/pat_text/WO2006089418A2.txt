 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 The present invention relates to nitrogen fixation by legumes, and more particularly, to new mutants of rhizobial bacteria which increase the amount of dry matter formed by nitrogen-fixing legumes. 
 BACKGROUND ART 
 Nitrogen fixation is a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship between rhizobial bacteria and leguminous plants that occurs within specialized root- associated structures called nodules containing one or more bacteroids wherein the plants provide carbon substrates derived from photosynthesis, as sources of energy during their catabolic metabolism to drive rhizobial respiration and metabolism in the bacteroids during nitrogen fixation. Furthermore, the carbon intermediates formed during catabolism serve as key building blocks for synthesis of organic compounds that incorporate the nitrogen derived from fixation. 
 It is well-known that the nitrogen fixation processes mediated by rhizobial bacteria have very high requirements for energy in the form of ATP for the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium ions by bacteroid nitrogenase enzymes. The ATP requirements are supplied through the flow of carbohydrates from photosynthate which is translocated to the root nodules. There, the photosynthate flows through several interconnected metabolic pathways which generally cleave disaccharides into 6-carbon monosaccharides which are then phosphorylated and subsequently catabolized through glycolytic processes, to produce C-4 dicarboxylic acid substrates that are supplied to the bactereoid as the sources of carbon and energy. 
 Within the bacteroid, the dicarboxylalic acid substrates must concurrently be: (a) oxidized by the TCA cycle to ultimately generate ATP, and (b) 

metabolized gluconeogenically to provide carbon intermediates for bacteroid proliferation. 
 The directionality of carbon flow through these pathways is precisely controlled by specific enzymes at each reaction step. Each enzyme's activity is directly affected by the accumulation and/or disappearance of its intermediate substrates. Furthermore, many of the enzymes involved in these pathways can directly affect their individual mediated reactions in both anabolic and catabolic directions, and thereby cause synthesis of short-term storage products such as glycogen and poly-hydroxybutyrate when intermediate substrates accumulate in one or more of these pathways, or alternatively, cause catabolism of the short- term storage products to drive the pathways when intermediate substrates become limiting. For example, if intermediate carbon substrates accumulate in the TCA cycle and/or during the metabolism of malate into pyruvate, then the intermediate substrates are incorporated into a gluconeogenesis pathway which as a key step, synthesizes glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate (G3P) as an intermediate and incorporates it into fructose- 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) for subsequent production of glycogen. For the most part, gluconeogenesis uses the same enzymes involved in glycolysis. 
 The interrelationships between carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways in nitrogen-fixing legumes are complex and have not yet been clearly defined. It is known that under certain conditions, lower rates of photosynthesis may limit rates of nitrogen fixation due to reduced supply of carbon substrates for generation of ATP to drive nitrogen fixation, and also, may negatively affect the amount of nitrogenase enzyme produced within the bacteroids. However, it has been shown that legume nodules typically do not have excess nitrogenase enzyme capacity available to respond to significantly increased supply of photosynthates by significantly increasing the amounts of nitrogen fixed. Furthermore, it appears that nitrogen fixation is not generally limited by the supply of photosynthates but rather, by the flow and utilization within the nodules of carbon substrates derived from catabolism of photosynthates.

 BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION 
 Carbon flow in rhizobial bacteria provides reducing power in the form of (NAD(P)H), energy in the form of ATP (derived from oxidative phosphorylation), and carbon skeletons for the formation of precursor molecules needed for bacterial growth. Regardless of environmental conditions and physiological state, sustained delivery of these products is required for ongoing microbial growth and function. There are two general modes of operation for carbon flow and metabolism in rhizobial bacteria. These are (a) the glycolysis pathway which is based on metabolism of glucose, and (b) the gluconeogenesis pathway which is based on metabolism of carbon substrates which possess fewer than 6 carbon units. Each pathway will be discussed in detail to provide background for description of the present invention. 

Glycolysis pathway 
 The catabolism of glucose in rhizobial bacteria, proceeds predominantly through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway as shown in Fig. 1 wherein glucose is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate which is subsequently converted to 6-phospho-gluconate (6PG) through reduction OfNADP +  to NADPH. The 6PG is then dehydrated to form a key 6-carbon intermediate in the ED pathway, 2- keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG). KDPG is then catabolized by KDPG aldolase to form two 3-carbon intermediates (a) pyruvate, and (b) glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate (G3P). The pyruvate enters the TCA cycle to ultimately yield ATP, NADPH and NADH. Depending on the rate of pyruvate uptake into the TCA cycle and the subsequent accumulation and utilization of TCA intermediates, the G3P produced by KDPG catabolism may: (a) be further catabolized into pyruvate through phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) via the lower half of the Embden-Meyerhof- Parnas pathway (EMP), or alternatively, (b) be recycled back into glucose-6- phosphate as shown by Portais et al. (1999, Eur. J. Biochem. 265: 473-480) and Gosselin et al. (FEBS Lett. 499: 45-49). This recycling of G3P is facilitated by its conversion to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) mediated by triose-phosphate isomerase (tpiA) after which, the DHAP is condensed with G3P to form fructose- 1,6-bisphosphate (F- 1,6-BP) which is then converted to fructose-6-phosphate and then to glucose-6-phosphate. The anabolic formation of glucose- 1 -phosphate from G3P is essential because it is the beginning of a pathway that leads to the formation of glycogen, an important short-term storage product as well as a requisite intermediate in the synthesis of exo- and lipo-polysaccharides (EPS and LPS respectively). 
 Gluconeogenesis pathway 
 Free-living rhizobial bacteria can via the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis pathway, concurrently assimilate and catabolize two different carbon storage compounds i.e. (a) poly-hydroxybutyrate, and (b) glycogen, as shown in Fig. 2 and discussed by Poole (2003, Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 22: 37-78). Finan et al. (1988, J. Bacteriol. 170: 3396-3403) using genetic and biochemical analysis, 

demonstrated that carbon flow in an anabolic direction from PEP to G3P in the lower portion of the EMP pathway, is absolutely essential for efficient gluconeogenesis in rhizobial bacteria. The G3P thus anabolically synthesized, may be further metabolized in one of two possible reactions. In the first reaction, some of the G3P is converted to DHAP through the activity of tpiA, following which the DHAP thus formed is condensed with additional G3P through the enzyme activity of F-1,6-BP aldolase to make F-1,6-BP. The second route is the anabolic reaction mediated by 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase to combine pyruvate and G3P into the 6-carbon KDGP. Finan et al. (1988) and Finan et al. (1991,MoI. Plant Microbe Interact. 18: 386-392) also demonstrated that the enzyme activities in the lower half of the EMP pathway flowing anabolically from PEP to G3P and also the enzyme activities required for synthesis of F- 1,6-BP and fructose -6-phosphate, are not affected when rhizobial bacteria are grown on media containing gluconeogenic substrates such as pyruvate, malate, succinate, oxaloacetate and PEP, thereby indicating that the predominant gluconeogenic carbon flow in rhizobial bacteria must occur via the EMP pathway and not the ED pathway. 
 Carbon flow in triose-phosphate isomerase rhizobial mutants of the present invention. 
 Since it is known that rhizobial bacterial growth occurs on laboratory media containing carbon substrates with fewer than 6 carbon units, then it follows that inplanta, if nitrogen-fixing bacteroids are not supplied with carbon substrates that can be catabolized into hexoses and converted to phosphorylated glucose intermediates, then these bacteroids must possess functioning gluconeogenic pathways. 
 Based on the genome sequence of S. meliloti published by Galilbert et al. (2001, Science 293: 668-672), there are only two possible pathways for gluconeogenesis, i.e., (1) the F-1,6BP aldolase-mediated synthesis of F-1,6BP from G3P and DHAP, and (2) the KDGP aldolase-mediated synthesis of KDGP from G3P and pyruvate. If S. meliloti is unable to use one or both these pathways, 

these rliizobial bacteria would not be able synthesize LPS, EPS, or glycerol thereby leading to lethal phenotypes if they are grown on gluconeogenic substrates such as succinate or malate as shown by Finan et al. (1988). 
 It is known, based on information disclosed in reviews by Stowers (1985, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 39: 89-108), Vance et al. (1991, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.Plant MoI. Biol. 42:373-392), and Lodwig et al. (Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 22: 37-78) that the predominant carbon substrate supplied by leguminous plants to bacteroids is a C-4 dicarboxylic acid. Very little is known about how carbon compounds other than glucose and succinate are utilized by rhizobial bacteria. 
 Because of this dearth of information, we have been working to precisely clarify the carbon pathways in rhizobial bacteria using Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm 1021 as our model organism. 
 Our general approach was to generate large numbers of mutants of S. meliloti Rm 1021 using procedures described in more detail in the following Example Section, and then screen the mutants individually for growth on a variety of media, each containing a single carbon substrate, also described in more detail in the Example Section. 
 We surprisingly found a S. meliloti Rm 1021 mutant lacking functional tpiA enzyme activities (referred to hereinafter as tpiA '  mutants) as evidenced by a lack of growth when cultured on either rhamnose or glycerol (both of which are gluconeogenic substrates). Since tpiA '  mutants are capable of synthesizing LPS, EPS and glycerol, it is apparent that carbon flow in these mutants must flow through the KDGP aldolase-mediated synthesis of KDGP from G3P and pyruvate, i.e., the anabolic route of the ED pathway. Finan et al. (1991) demonstrated that enzyme activities when the ED pathway is flowing in the anabolic direction, are reduced 30-fold when rhizobial bacteria are grown on media containing dicarboxylic acid as a carbon source and also in explanta bacteroids. 
 However, we surprisingly found that alfalfa inoculated with these tpiA "  mutants accumulated significantly more dry matter than alfalfa inoculated with 

the wild-type S. meliloti Rm 1021 strain. Therefore, it appears that in these tpiA "  mutants, gluconeogenesis is significantly impaired but not eliminated thereby causing an accumulation of carbon substrates associated with the lower half of the EMP pathway. These carbon intermediates are then available to be funnelled to other pathways. The most active sink for these "excess" carbon intermediates is the TCA cycle where they will be oxidized thereby generating reductant in the form of NAD(P)H that can be utilized for either oxidative phosphorylation thereby generating ATP, or alternatively, in combination with nitrogenase synthesis and activity in the bacteroids, thereby resulting increased nitrogen fixation and its incorporation into plant biomass. 
 The generation of rhizobial tpiA '  mutants, their characterization, and use for increasing the accumulation of dry matter in leguminous plants are described in more detail in the following examples.

 The bacterial strains were routinely grown at 30 0 C on complex (LB) or defined (VMM) media as described by Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular Cloning Manual, 2 nd  Ed., Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbour, NY) and Richardson et al. (2004, J. Bacteriol. 186:8433-8442). When required, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: tetracycline (Tc) either 5 or 10 μg ml "1 ; neomycin (Nm), 200 μg ml "1 ; kanamycin (Kan), 50 μg ml "1 ; streptomycin (Sm) , 200 μg ml "1 ; rifampicin (Rf), 100 μg ml "1 ; cloramphenicol (Cm), 20 μg ml "1 ; gentamycin (Gm) 20 or 50 μg ml "1 . Growth was routinely monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. 

DNA MANIPULATIONS AND CONSTRUCTIONS 
 Standard techniques were used for plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme digests, ligations, transformations, and agarose gel electrophoresis by Sambrook et al. (1989). 
 To construct pNP149 a 430 bp fragment internal to fbaB was amplified using genomic RmlO21 DNA as a template and the primers fbaB 5' ( 5'- ATATGGATCCTCCCGAATGAAACGATAACC-S 1 ) and fbaB3' (5'- TATAGGTACCGCGCTTCAGCACCTTGAT-S 1 ). This band was cloned as a BarnHI I Kpnl fragment into pKNOCK-Gm as outlined by Alexyev (1999, Biotechniques 26:824-828), and transformed into competent E. coli S 17-1 as described by Simon et al. (1983, Bio/Techniques 1: 784-791). 
 To construct pNP150 a 350 bp internal fragment to tpiA2 was amplified using genomic Rm 1021 DNA as a template and the primers tpiA2 5' (5'- ATATGATCCAGAACATGCACTGGGACGAT-S 1 ) and tpiA2 3' (TATAGGTACCGCTCGTAAGCCAGAAGAACG-S 1 ). The band was gel purified and cloned as a BamHVKpnl fragment into pBlueScriptll SK yielding pNP 151. This band was subsequently isolated from pNP 151 and ligated into pKNOCK-Gm outlined by Alexyev (1999) and transformed into competent E. coli S17-1 as described by Simon et al. (1983) yielding pNP150. 
 GENETIC TECHNIQUES 
 Mutagenesis of RmI 021 or RmG212 with Tn5 or Tn5B20 was carried out following the method of Finan et al. (1985, Cell 40: 869-877). Transductions, using 0 M12, were performed as described by Glazebrook (1991, Methods of Enzymol. 204: 398-418). Conjugations were carried out as described by Finan et al. (1988, J, Bacteriol. 170: 3396-3403). 
 Construction of tpiB and fbaB was accomplished by conjugating either pNP149 or pNP150 into RmlO21 and Rm5000 respectively. Single crossovers were selected for by plating on either VMM agar containing Sm and Gm (for crosses into RmI 021) or onto LB containing Rf and Gm (for crosses into 

Rm5000). A number of colonies were purified in each case and had the point of insertion verified by transductional linkage to surrounding markers. 
 CHARACTERIZATION OF MUTANTS 
 To identify the insertion point of individual Tn5 inserts, a modification of an arbitrary PCR protocol was utilized following the methods described by Caetano-Annoles (1993, PCR Methods Appl. 3: 85-92) and Raffa et al. (2002, Molec. Microbiol. 45:1599-1611). Strains containing either Tn5 inserts were purified and the genomic DNA was used as a template. A low stringency PCR amplification using the primers IS50(l) (5 '-C ACGATG A AG AGC AG AAG-3 1 ) and DGEN(I) (5'-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTCAGNNNNNNNNNNACGCC- 3') was carried out. The products of this reaction were subsequently amplified with a higher stringency PCR amplification using the primers IS50(2) (5'- TAGGAGGTCACATGGAAGTCAGAT-S') and DGEN(2) (5 1 - GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAGTCAG-S'). The primers IS50(l) and IS50(2) are found within the IS50 elements of Tn5 such that the IS50(l) primer is nested between IS50(2) primer and the sequence flanking the transposon. The DGEN(2) primer was designed to be complementary to the end of DGEN(I). The products of the second PCR reaction were gel isolated and sequenced using the IS50(l) primer using the method of Oresnik et al. (1998, Molec. Plant-Microbe Interact. 11: 1175- 1185). Sequencing reactions were done with dye terminators and detected with an ABI automated sequencer at the university of Calgary Core DNA facilities. Sequence data were trimmed of IS50 sequences and database searches were done with the BLASTX program as outlined by Altschul et al. (1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402) against the S. meliloti database dittpV/bioinfo.genopole-toulouse.prd.fr/annotation/iANT/bacteria/rhime). 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 Effects of carbon sources on growth of S. meliloti tpf mutants on solid media 
 A tpiA '  mutant of S. meliloti Rm 1021 produced as described above, was isolated as a slow-growth phenotype on a defined medium with rhamnose as a 

sole carbon source, and identified as SRmAl 85. To ensure that SRmAl 85 was not carrying any other unrelated mutations, the Tn5 was transduced from SRmA185 into the wild-type RmlO21 by selecting for the transduction of the neomycin marker associated with the Tn5. The transductants were screened for the cotransduction of the rhamnose phenotype. One of these transductants was purified and saved as SRmA327. 
 The site of insertion of the transposon in the genome was determined by using an arbitrary PCR protocol. Fig. 4 shows the results of a BLASTN analysis comparing DNA extracted from the SRmA327 strain, with the S. meliloti RmI 021 database. The query sequence is the DNA immediately flanking the Tn5 insert from the tpiA mutant, while the subject sequence shows the corresponding matching DNA from the S. meliloti Rm 1021 database. These data show that the transposon is inserted into a gene that has been annotated as a triose phosphate isomerase. Fig 5 is a visual representation of the DNA map showing that the flanking DNA corresponds to the insertion of a nucleotide sequence identified as Seq. ID No. 1, being at the beginning of the tpiAl region. The intergenic region of 126 base pairs between tpiAl and the next gene, Y 1024 makes it unlikely that these genes are cotranscribed. 
 Since the genome of Rm 1021 has two tpi genes annotated, we wished to demonstrate that tpiA was in fact the triose-phosphate isomerase that was utilized in the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. PCR primers were designed and a knockout mutant, designated tpiB, of the second triose-phosphate isomerase annotated in the Rm 1021 genome was generated as described above. Based on annotation of the genome, the mutants were tested for their ability to grow on media incorporating erythritol as the sole carbon source. The results (Table 3) demonstrate that these tpiB mutants are in fact unable to use erythritol as a sole carbon source thereby confirming that tpiB is used for erythritol catabolism, and not glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.

 EXAMPLE 2 
 Biochemical activity of S. meliloti tpi mutants 
 Bacterial cells to be used for enzyme assays were grown overnight in LB broth and used to inoculate flasks containing 500 ml of either LB or defined media containing 15 mM succinate, glucose or erythritol as a sole carbon source. Cultures were grown overnight in a shaker (G25 Environmental Incubator Shaker; New Brunswick Scientific Co. Inc., New Brunswick NJ.) at 300 rpm. Cultures were routinely streaked onto LB agar plates when they were harvested to ensure purity of the cultures before their extracts were used for enzyme assays. 
 Cells were pelleted by spinning them in a centrifuge (4,000 x g, 10 minutes) and resuspended (2 ml/g cell wet weight) in an extraction buffer containing 100 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM MgCl 2 . Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French Pressure cell (16,000 psi). The extract was subsequently pelleted (10,000 x g, 15 minutes, 5°C) and the supernatant was used as the cell-free extract. The extract was further centrifuged in a microfuge for 15 minutes to reduce NADH oxidase activity for assays that measured the disappearance of NADH. Triose-phosphate isomerase activity was 

assayed following a method based on Lynch et al. (1975, Can. J. Microbiol. 21: 1560-1572). Specific activities were expressed as nmol NADH oxidized per minute per milligram protein. Protein was measured as described by Bradford using a protein determination reagent (Sigma) and bovine serum albumin as a standard, following the method described by Bradford (1976, Anal. Biochem. 72: 248-254). 
 The results show that there are two sources of trios-phosphate isomerase activity in & meliloti RmlO21. One is from tpiAl, which appears to be constitutively expressed, the other is from tpiBl, which is really part of the operon involved in erythritol catabolism and is inducible by erythritol. When SRmA327 is grown using either glucose or succinate as a sole carbon source, tpiB activity is not induced. This strongly suggests that tpiA is the glycolytic triose phosphate isomerase.

EXAMPLE 3 
 Effects of ervthritol and glycerol on tpi S. meliloti mutants 
 Since tpiB mutants were able to grow on either glycerol or rhamnose but were annotated as being a triose phosphate isomerase, we were curious whether a tpiB enzyme activity could rescue a tpiA '  mutant. Accordingly, S. meliloti RmI 021 mutants generated as described previously, and characterized as having either tpiA, tpiB or both mutations, were streaked onto defined solid media containing either low or high concentrations of erythritol, and also, onto solid media containing either low or high concentrations of erythritol plus 15 mM glycerol. 
 The results in Table 5 show that in media containing an inducing sugar on which a tpiB mutant cannot grow (erythritol), plus a non-inducing sugar on which a tpiB mutant can grow (glycerol), growth of the tpiB '  mutant does not occur. This result indicates that the inducing sugar is converted to a phosphorylated intermediate which cannot be removed. Since the glycerol is present, the cell attempts to grow and thereby this becomes toxic to the cell. A similar result has been recently shown by Richardson et al 2004 (2004, J. Bacteriolo 186: 8433- 8442) with Rhizobium leguminosarum mutants unable to use rhamnose as a sole carbon source. However at low levels of erythritol, SRmA237 can grow on with glycerol thereby demonstrating that a i!pL4 " mutation can be rescued by induction of tpiB.

 Effects of a tpi S. meliloti mutant on dry matter accumulation in alfalfa 
 Alfalfa seeds {Medicαgo sαtivα cv. Rangelander) were surface-sterilized by soaking immersion for 5 minutes in 90 % ethanol, followed by a 10-minute soaking immersion in 1% hypochlorite. The seeds were then washed with at least 10 volumes of sterile distilled water. The seeds were subsequently sown onto 1 % water agar plates and placed into a germination chamber. Germinating seeds were aseptically planted by hand into a sterile sand-vermiculite that had been presoaked with Jensen's plant nutrient solution prepared as disclosed by Glazebrook (1991). 
 Plants were inoculated with cultures of S. meliloti tpiA "  mutant SRmAl 85 or SRmA327 that had been grown overnight in LB and diluted 1/100 into 10 ml of sterile distilled water to a titre of approximately 1 x 10 6  cfu/ml. The 10 ml was used to inoculate a pot containing 10 alfalfa seedlings. 
 Plants were harvested 28-35 days after inoculation and dry weights of the shoots cut at the cotyledon were used to assess symbiotic proficiency. Bacteria were also re-isolated from nodules and tested to confirm they were true to the phenotype inoculated.

 Strains Dry matter (mg/plant) a  Percent wild-type 
 RmlO21 34.9 ± 3.0 100 
 SRmAl85 42.9 ± 2.8 122.9 
 Uninoculated 6.2 ± 0.4 17.7 
   a  dry weight data are the average ± standard error of three independent replicates. Each replicate contained between 8 and 10 plants. 
 Statistical analysis of these results suggests that the mean increase between the mutant and the wild-type is sound at the 92.5% confidence level. This same experiment was replicated in three completely independent trials. In each case the  •  average dry weight accumulation of SRmA327 was between 115-122% of the RmI 021. Paired Students t-test analyses on the difference of the means between the wild-type and SRmA327 suggest that the ability of a tpiA mutant to accumulate more dry weight than the wild-type is sound at greater than a 95% confidence interval (Table 7).

 While this invention has been described with respect to the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that various alternations and modifications may be made that will be apparent to those skilled in this art, e.g., for affecting and/or impairing and/or inactivating functioning triose-phosphate isomerase enzyme activities in other strains of Rhizobium sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Sinorhizobium sp., Mesorhizobium sp. and Azorhizobium sp., and therefore, the scope of the present invention is to be considered limited solely by the appended claims.
