 The present invention relates to a novel lactic acid bacteria having probiotics activity. 
 The genus  Sporolactobacillus  was defined by Kitahara & Suzuki (1963) to accommodate a catalase-negative, spore-forming, homofermentative, lactic acid-producing bacterial species,  Sporolactobacillus inulinus , within the family Lactobacillaceae. Recently, all members representing Sporolactobacilli were grouped in the family Sporolactobacillaceae (Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, Garrity & Holt, 2001). Six species in the genus  Sporolactobacillus  have been reported; they are from rather limited isolation sources.  S. inulinus  was isolated from chicken feed and the other species,  S. kofuensis, S. lactosus, S. laevolacticus, S. nakayamae  and  S. terrae , were isolated from the rhizosphere or soil around root hairs of a variety of wild plants collected in Japan and South-East Asia, suggesting that  Sporolactobacillus  microorganisms are only isolated from a limited area. 
 The present inventors completed this invention by confirming that novel  Sporolactobacillus vineae  SL153 (Accession No: KCTC 11493 BP) isolated from soil had high potential for being used as a probiotic strain because it had growth inhibitory effect on  Vibrio  and other various pathogenic microorganisms. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention provides a novel  Sporolactobacillus vineae  SL153 strain (Accession No: KCTC 11493BP) which inhibits the growth of intestinal pathogenic microorganisms. 
 The present invention also provides probiotics containing one or more substances selected from the group consisting of the strain, the supernatant thereof and the antimicrobial metabolite recovered from the same as active ingredients. 
 The present invention further provides a composition for the improvement of intestinal microflora, said composition containing the probiotics as an active ingredient. 
 The present invention also provides a health food for the improvement of intestinal microflora, said health food containing the said probiotics as an active ingredient. 
 The present invention also provides a feed additive for the improvement of intestinal microflora, said feed additive containing the said probiotics as an active ingredient. 
 In addition, the present invention provides a method for producing probiotics containing the step of culturing the said strain.

 EXAMPLE 1 
 Isolation and Identification of Strain 
 To isolate a strain producing lactic acid, the present inventors collected soil samples from vineyard near Taejon, Korea. The vineyard soil sample was diluted and cultured on GYP (glucose-yeast extract-peptone) medium containing 1% CaCO 3  at 30° C. for 48 hours. After incubation, acid-producing bacteria were identified by the appearance of clear zones around colonies, selected and purified by repeated isolation three times. The purified microorganism was loaded in a culture medium supplemented with 20% glycerol, which was stored at −80° C. 
 Molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene of the isolated strain. Particularly, the cultured cells were suspended in 100 μl of STES buffer [0.4 M NaCl, 0.2 M Tris-HCl(pH 7.6), 0.01 M EDTA, 1% SDS], to which glass beads were added, followed by lysis using microtube mixer MT-360 (TOMY, USA) for 5 minutes to elute cytoplasm. DNA was purified from the eluent using phenol-ethanol PPT and dried using vacuum dryer (SpeedVac, Eppendorf, Germany). The DNA was then dissolved in sterilized distilled water, which was used as a template for PCR. PCR was performed with the primer set of 27F (SEQ. ID. NO: 1,5′-GAG TTT GAT CCT GGC TCA G-3′) and 1492R (SEQ. ID. NO: 2,5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) as follows; denaturation at 94° C. for 1 minute, annealing at 50° C. for 1 minute, polymerization at 72° C. for 1 minute 50 seconds, 30 cycles from denaturation to polymerization. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed by the method well-known to those in the art (Chang et al.,  Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol.  52: 377-381, 2002). 
 Morphological characteristics of the selected strain were investigated. As a result, the strain was confirmed to be a Gram-positive  bacillus.  16S rRNA gene sequence (SEQ. ID. NO: 3) of the selected strain was investigated. As a result, the strain was identified as a novel  Sporolactobacillus  having 95.7% homology with  Sporolactobacillus inulinus  and 95.5% homology with  Sporolactobacillus terrae , and it was named  Sporolactobacillus vineae . A phylogenetic tree showing the molecular phylogenetic position of the  Sporolactobacillus vineae  is shown in  FIG. 1 . The strain was deposited at Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korean Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, #52 Oun-dong, Yusong-ku, Taejon 305-333, Korea, on Mar. 30, 2009 under the name of “ Sporolactobacillus vineae  SL153” (KCTC 11493BP).

 Growth Inhibitory Effect on Pathogens 
 To investigate growth inhibitory effect on pathogenic microorganisms, following experiment was performed with  Sporolactobacillus vineae  SL153 and  Sporolactobacillus inulinus (reference strain). 10 strains including  Escherichi coli  KCTC 2441, provided from KCTC (Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korean Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology), were used as pathogenic microorganisms.  Escherichi coli  KCTC 2441,  Staphylococcus aureus  KCTC1621,  Salmonella typhimurium  KCTC 1925, and  Edwardsiella tarda  KCTC12267 were cultured on Tryptic soy agar (Difco, USA) and  Vibrio cholerae  KCTC 2715 , V. alginolyticus  KCTC2928, V. fluvialis KCTC2473, V. parahaemolyticus KCTC2729,  Aeromonas bivalvium  KCTC22102, and  Listonella anguillarum  KCTC2711 were cultured on marine agar (Difco). Experiments were performed according to the methods well-known to those in the art (Chang et al.,  Kor. J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.  27 (1), 23-27, 1999). The diameter of the inhibition zone (mm) was measured by using paper disc (8 mm, Yoyo Roshi Kaisha, Japan). Concentration of the strain which had been cultured for 18 hours was adjusted to 10 6˜7  CFU/ml, followed by distribution on Mueller-Hinton agar and drying. Sterilized disc was inoculated with 100 μl of supernatant of the isolated strain, followed by culture for 48 hours. Equal amount of MRS medium not-inoculated was used as the negative control, followed by comparison of antimicrobial activity. 
 As shown in Table 4 , S. vineae  had better inhibitory effect on the growth of  Vibrio cholerae, V. alginolyticus, V. fluvialis, V. parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas bivalvium  and  Listonella anguillarum , compared with  S. inulinus .

 EXAMPLE 6 
 Intestinal Adherence 
 To investigate intestinal adherence of the strain selected in Example 1, the present inventors used human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 (ATCC HT-38).  Sporolactobacillus inulinus  was used as the reference strain for comparison with  Sporolactobacillus vineae  SL153. HT-29 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS.  S. vineae  strain well-grown on GYP broth was washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and transferred in serum-free RPMI 1640. Cultured HT-29 strain was distributed in a 16-well cell culture plate (BD science, USA) and followed by culture until monolayer was formed. The prepared  S. vineae  (10 9  CFU/Ml) was added thereto, followed by further culture in a 37° C. 5% CO 2  incubator. After 2 hours of culture,  S. vineae  not-attached on HT-29 was washed with PBS and the attached strain was recovered by using 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by culture on GYP agar (Difco, USA) at 37° C. for 72 hours. The population of the strain was counted. Intestinal adherence of  S. inulinus  used as the reference strain was also investigated using HT-29 by the same manner as described above. 
 As a result, compared with  S. inulinus , the strain of the present invention demonstrated similar intestinal adherence, suggesting that the strain has excellent potential for probiotics ( FIG. 2 ).
