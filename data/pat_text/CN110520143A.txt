Crawl ground SOD from cactus, plant medicinal herbs SOD and muskmelon SOD.In particular, effect is poor at low concentration (10U/ml and 25U/ml)
It is different significant.That is, when SOD concentration is 10U/ml, the increasing of SOD from cactus and muskmelon SOD to colorectal cancer SW480 cell of crawl ground
No inhibiting effect is grown, and plant medicinal herbs SOD and GF423 SOD show about 10% inhibiting effect.It is 25U/ in SOD concentration
When ml, plant medicinal herbs SOD shows about 10% inhibitory effect, and GF423 SOD of the invention shows about 40% high suppression
Effect processed. 
 With reference to Fig. 6 B, crawl SOD from cactus, plant medicinal herbs SOD and muskmelon SOD (BioNov) to colorectal cancer HT 29
The proliferation of cell shows low inhibiting effect (about 10% or lower), until SOD is at concentrations up to 100U/ml, and it is of the invention
GF423 SOD shows inhibitory effect since when concentration is 25U/ml, and about 15% inhibitory effect is shown in 25U/ml,
30% inhibitory effect is shown in 50U/ml, and is had to the proliferation for the colorectal cancer cell that concentration is 100U/ml
Very excellent inhibiting effect (50%). 
 From such results, it can be seen that there is SOD activity by what bacillus amyloliquefaciens GF423 bacterial strain of the invention generated
Polypeptide show the inhibiting effect to colorectal cancer cell proliferation, and compared with commercialized SOD under low concentration
Also show that excellent inhibiting effect.
