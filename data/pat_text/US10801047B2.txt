 TECHNICAL FIELD 
 The present disclosure relates to a putrescine-producing microorganism and a method of producing putrescine using the corresponding microorganism. 
 BACKGROUND ART 
 Coryneform microorganisms are Gram-positive microorganisms that are frequently used in industrial production of substances with various applications, such as feeds, pharmaceuticals, and foods including L-amino acids and various nucleic acids. In recent years, diamine and keto-acid are produced from coryneform microorganisms. 
 In order to produce useful products through microbial fermentation, a demand for an energy source or a reducing power is increased, along with strengthening the biosynthetic pathway of a target product in microorganisms. Among them, NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is an essential element in providing a reducing power. The oxidized form NADP +  and the reduced form NADPH are in vivo electron transfer materials and are involved in various synthesis processes. Among the central metabolic pathways, NADPH is known to be mainly produced by 1) the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and 2) the NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icd gene) of the TCA pathway. In addition, various microorganisms have malate enzyme, glucose dehydrogenase, and non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in various alternative pathways to supply NADPH. 
 Further, regardless of the central metabolic pathway, NADPH-producing enzymes include transhydrogenase, Ferredoxin:NADP +  oxidoreductase, etc. 
 Meanwhile, putrescine is known as one of the raw materials of polyamide. Putrescine has been mainly produced by chemical methods of using petroleum compounds as raw materials, and technologies for producing putrescine by fermentation using genetic engineering technology and fermentation technology are currently being studied. For example, a method of producing a high concentration of putrescine by transforming  E. coli  and a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  is disclosed (Morris et al., J Biol. Chem. 241: 13, 3129-3135, 1966, International Publication No. WO06/005603; International Publication No. WO09/125924; Qian Z D et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 104: 4, 651-662, 2009; Schneider et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 88: 4, 859-868, 2010; Schneider et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 91: 17-30, 2011). 
 However, there have been no reports on the relationship between a reducing power and a putrescine production capacity.

 With regard to the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, NAD +  kinase, gluconate kinase, or NAD+ diphosphatase, the amino sequence of the given protein showing the activity may vary depending on the species or strain of the microorganism, and therefore, and thus is not limited to the origin or sequence thereof. 
 Further, in the present disclosure, each of the above enzymes may include the protein having the amino acid sequence of the above-described SEQ ID NO., or a protein having 80% or more, 85% or more, specifically 90% or more, more specifically 95% or more, and much more specifically 99% or more homology or identity to the amino acid sequence. 
 Further, as a sequence having homology or identity to the sequence, if the amino acid sequence substantially has biological activities identical or corresponding to those of each enzyme protein of the above-described SEQ ID NO., it is obvious in that the an amino acid sequence with deletion, modification, substitution, or addition in part of the sequences should also be included in the scope of the present disclosure. 
 A polynucleotide encoding NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, NAD +  kinase, gluconate kinase, or NAD +  diphosphatase of the present disclosure may include a polynucleotide encoding the protein having the amino acid sequence of the above-described SEQ ID NO., or the protein having 80% or more, 85% or more, specifically 90% or more, more specifically 95% or more, much more specifically 99% or more homology or identity to the above sequence, as long as it has biological activity identical or corresponding to that of the enzyme protein of NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, NAD +  kinase, gluconate kinase, or NAD +  diphosphatase. For example, the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 8, the transketolase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 17, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 28, the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 33 or SEQ ID NO: 37, the NAD(P) transhydrogenase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 40 or SEQ ID NO: 42, the nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62, SEQ ID NO: 66, or SEQ ID NO: 70, the NAD +  kinase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 82 or SEQ ID NO: 86, and the gluconate kinase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID NO: 52, SEQ ID NO: 54, or SEQ ID NO: 60, and the NAD+ diphosphatase may be encoded by a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 74 or SEQ ID NO: 80, but is not limited thereto. 
 Further, in the polynucleotide, various modifications may be made in the coding region provided that they do not change the amino acid sequence of the protein expressed from the coding region, due to codon degeneracy or in consideration of codons preferred by an organism in which the protein is to be expressed. Therefore, any polynucleotide encoding NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, NAD +  kinase, gluconate kinase, or NAD +  diphosphatase may be included without limitation, as long as it is a polynucleotide sequence encoding the enzyme protein. 
 Further, a probe which may be produced from a known nucleotide sequence, for example, a sequence which hybridizes with a complementary sequence to all or a part of the polynucleotide sequence under stringent conditions to encode the protein having activity of the enzyme protein of NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, NAD +  kinase, gluconate kinase, or NAD +  diphosphatase may also be included without limitation. 
 The ‘homology’ or ‘identity’ means the degree of relevance between two given amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences, and may be expressed as a percentage. 
 The terms ‘homology’ and ‘identity’ may be often used interchangeably. 
 The sequence homology or identity of the conserved polynucleotide or polypeptide may be determined by standard alignment algorithms, and may be used with default gap penalties established by the used program. Substantially, homologous or identical sequences may hybridize under moderately or highly stringent conditions such that the full length of the sequence or at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% or more of the full-length may hybridize. Also, contemplated are polynucleotides that contain degenerate codons in place of codons in the hybridization. 
 Whether or not any two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences have homology, similarity, or identity may be determined using known computer algorithms such as the “FASTA” program, using, for example, the default parameters as in Pearson et al (1988)[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85]: 2444, or determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16: 276-277) (version 5.0.0 or later) (including GCG program package (Devereux, J., et al, Nucleic Acids Research 12: 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA (Atschul, [S.] [F.,] [ET AL, J MOLEC BIOL 215]: 403 (1990); Guide to Huge Computers, Martin J. Bishop, [ED.,] Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, and [CARILLO ETA/.](1988) SIAM J Applied Math 48: 1073). For example, BLAST of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, or ClustalW may be used to determine homology, similarity, or identity. 
 Homology, similarity, or identity of polynucleotides or polypeptides may be determined, for example, by comparing sequence information using a GAP computer program such as Needleman et al. (1970), J Mol Biol. 48: 443, as disclosed in Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math (1981) 2:482. Briefly, the GAP program defines similarity as the number of aligned symbols (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids), which are similar, divided by the total number of symbols in the shorter of the two sequences. Default parameters for the GAP program may include: (1) a unary comparison matrix (containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non-identities) and the weighted comparison matrix of Gribskov et al (1986) Nucl. Acids Res. 14: 6745, as disclosed in Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds., Atlas Of Protein Sequence And Structure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, pp. 353-358 (1979) (or EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix); (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap (or gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5); and (3) no penalty for end gaps. Therefore, as used herein, the term “homology” or “identity” represents relevance between sequences. 
 As used herein, the term “enhancement of activity” means that the activity of the enzyme protein is introduced, or the activity is improved, as compared with the endogenous activity possessed by a microorganism or its activity before modification. The “introduction” of the activity means that activity of a specific protein which is not originally possessed by a microorganism is naturally or artificially exhibited. The “non-modified microorganism” refers to a microorganism that has activity of a specific protein originally possessed by the parent strain before transformation, when the trait of the microorganism to be compared is changed by a genetic variation in the specific protein of the microorganism, which is caused by natural or artificial factors. The “endogenous activity” refers to activity of a specific protein originally possessed by the parent strain before transformation, when the trait of the microorganism is changed by a genetic variation caused by natural or artificial factors. In the present disclosure, the non-modification may be used interchangeably with a state having the endogenous activity without genetic variation. 
 For example, the enhancement of activity may include all of introducing exogenous NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and/or NAD(P) transhydrogenase or enhancing the activity thereof after introduction, and enhancing activity of the endogenous transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, and/or NAD +  kinase. Specifically, the enhancement of the activity in the present disclosure may be performed by 
 (1) increasing the copy number of the polynucleotide encoding each of the enzymes; 
 (2) modifying the expression control sequence for increasing expression of the polynucleotide; 
 (3) modifying the polynucleotide sequence on the chromosome for enhancing the activity of each of the enzymes; and 
 (4) modifying for the enhancement by a combination thereof, but is not limited thereto. 
 1) The increase of the copy number of the polynucleotide may be, but is not particularly limited to, performed in a form in which the polynucleotide is operably linked to a vector, or by inserting the polynucleotide into the chromosome of a host cell. Further, the increase of the copy number may be carried out by introducing a foreign polynucleotide exhibiting the enzyme activity or a codon-optimized variant polynucleotide of the polynucleotide into a host cell. Any foreign polynucleotide sequence may be used without limitation in the origin or sequence thereof, as long as it exhibits the activity identical/similar to that of the above enzyme. The introduction may be carried out by a known transformation method which is appropriately selected by those skilled in the art, and the enzyme may be produced by expression of the introduced polynucleotide in the host cell, and as a result, its activity may be increased. 
 Next, 2) the modification of the expression control sequence for increasing the expression of the polynucleotide may be, but is not particularly limited to, performed by inducing a modification on the sequence through deletion, insertion, non-conservative or conservative substitution of the nucleotide sequence, or a combination thereof to further enhance the activity of the expression control sequence, or by replacing the polynucleotide sequence with a nucleotide sequence having a stronger activity. The expression control sequence includes, but is not particularly limited to, a promoter, an operator sequence, a sequence encoding a ribosome-binding site, and a sequence regulating the termination of transcription and translation. 
 Specifically, a strong exogenous promoter, instead of the original promoter, may be connected to the upstream region of the expression unit of the polynucleotide. Examples of the strong promoter may include CJ7 promoter, lysCP1 promoter, EF-Tu promoter, groEL promoter, aceA or aceB promoter, etc. More specifically, lysCP1 promoter (WO 2009/096689) or CJ7 promoter (WO2006/065095), which is a  Corynebacterium -derived promoter, may be operably linked to increase the expression rate of the polynucleotide encoding the enzyme, but is not limited thereto. 
 Furthermore, 3) the modification of the polynucleotide sequence on the chromosome may be, but is not particularly limited to, performed by inducing a modification on the expression control sequence through deletion, insertion, non-conservative or conservative substitution of the polynucleotide sequence, or a combination thereof to further enhance the activity of the polynucleotide sequence, or by replacing the polynucleotide sequence with a polynucleotide sequence which is improved to have a stronger activity. 
 Lastly, 4) the method of modifying for the enhancement by a combination of 1) to 3) may be performed by applying one or more of the methods of increasing the copy number of the polynucleotide encoding the protein, modifying the expression control sequence for increasing the expression of the polynucleotide, modifying the polynucleotide sequence on the chromosome, and introducing a foreign polynucleotide exhibiting the activity of the protein or a variant polynucleotide in which the codons thereof are codon-optimized. 
 As used herein, the term “vector” is a DNA construct that includes a nucleotide sequence of a polynucleotide encoding a desired protein operably linked to an appropriate regulatory sequence to enable expression of the desired protein in an appropriate host cell. The regulatory sequence may include a promoter capable of initiating transcription, any operator sequence for the regulation of such transcription, a sequence encoding an appropriate mRNA ribosome-binding domain, and a sequence regulating termination of transcription and translation. After the vector is transformed into the appropriate host cell, it may replicate or function independently of the host genome, and may be integrated into the genome itself. 
 The vector used in the present disclosure is not particularly limited, as long as it is able to replicate in the host cell, and any vector known in the art may be used. Examples of commonly used vectors may include a natural or recombinant plasmid, cosmid, virus, and bacteriophage. For instance, pWE15, M13, MBL3, MBL4, IXII, ASHII, APII, t10, t11, Charon4A, Charon21A, etc. may be used as a phage vector or cosmid vector. As a plasmid vector, pBR type, pUC type, pBluescriptII type, pGEM type, pTZ type, pCL type, pET type, etc. may be used. Specifically, pDZ, pACYC177, pACYC184, pCL, pECCG117, pUC19, pBR322, pMW118, pCC1BAC vector, etc. may be used, but is not limited thereto. 
 The vector applicable in the present disclosure is not particularly limited, and a known expression vector may be used. Further, the polynucleotide encoding the desired protein may be inserted into the chromosome using a vector for intracellular chromosomal insertion. The chromosomal insertion of the polynucleotide may be performed by any method known in the art, for example, homologous recombination, but is not limited thereto. A selection marker to confirm the chromosomal insertion may be further included. The selection marker is to select cells transformed with the vector, that is, to confirm insertion of the desired nucleotide molecule, and the selection marker may include markers providing selectable phenotypes, such as drug resistance, auxotrophy, resistance to cytotoxic agents, or expression of surface proteins. Since only cells expressing the selection marker are able to survive or to show different phenotypes under the environment treated with a selective agent, the transformed cells may be selected. 
 As used herein, the term “transformation” means introduction of a vector including a polynucleotide encoding a target protein into a host cell in such a way that the protein encoded by the polynucleotide is expressed in the host cell. As long as the transformed polynucleotide is expressed in the host cell, it may be integrated into and placed in the chromosome of the host cell, or it may exist extrachromosomally, or irrespective thereof. Further, the polynucleotide includes DNA and RNA encoding the target protein. The polynucleotide may be introduced in any form, as long as it may be introduced into the host cell and expressed therein. For example, the polynucleotide may be introduced into the host cell in the form of an expression cassette, which is a gene construct including all elements required for its autonomous expression. Commonly, the expression cassette includes a promoter operably linked to the polynucleotide, transcriptional termination signals, ribosome binding sites, and translation termination signals. The expression cassette may be in the form of a self-replicable expression vector. Also, the polynucleotide as it is may be introduced into the host cell and operably linked to sequences required for expression in the host cell, but is not limited thereto. A method of performing the transformation may include any method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell, and the transformation may be performed by selecting an appropriate standard technique as known in the art depending on the host cell. For example, the method may include electroporation, calcium phosphate (CaPO 4 ) precipitation, calcium chloride (CaCl 2 )) precipitation, microinjection, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, a DEAE-dextran method, a cationic liposome method, and a lithium acetate-DMSO method, etc., but is not limited thereto. 
 As used herein, the term “operably linked” means a functional linkage between the polynucleotide sequence encoding the desired protein of the present disclosure and a promoter sequence which initiates and mediates transcription of the polynucleotide. The operable linkage may be prepared using a genetic recombinant technology known in the art, and site-specific DNA cleavage and linkage may be prepared using restriction and ligation enzymes in the art, but is not limited thereto. 
 As used herein, the term “inactivation” refers to attenuation of the activity, no expression of the activity, or no activity even though expressed, as compared with the endogenous activity of the enzyme protein originally possessed by the microorganism or the activity before modification. The inactivation is a concept referring to a case when the activity of an enzyme is attenuated or eliminated, compared with that originally possessed by the microorganism, due to a modification in the enzyme-encoding polynucleotide, a case when the overall intracellular enzymatic activity is attenuated or eliminated, as compared with that of the natural type strain of the microorganism, due to inhibition of expression of the gene encoding the same or inhibition of translation thereof, a case when part or all of the gene is deleted, and a combination thereof, but is not limited thereto. 
 The inactivation of the enzyme activity may be achieved by applying various methods well known in the art. Examples of the methods may include 1) a method of replacing the gene encoding the enzyme on the chromosome with a mutated gene so that the enzyme activity may be attenuated, including the case when the enzyme activity is eliminated; 2) a method of modifying the expression regulatory sequence of the gene encoding the enzyme on the chromosome; 3) a method of replacing the expression regulatory sequence of the gene encoding the enzyme with a sequence having a weak activity or no activity; 4) a method of deleting part or all of the gene encoding the enzyme on the chromosome; 5) a method of introducing an antisense oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense RNA), which inhibits the translation from the mRNA into an enzyme via a complementary binding to the transcript of the gene on the chromosome; 6) a method of making the attachment of ribosome impossible by forming a secondary structure by artificially adding a sequence complementary to SD sequence on the front end of the SD sequence of the gene encoding the enzyme; 7) a method of RTE (reverse transcription engineering), which adds a promoter so as to be reversely transcribed on the 3′ terminus of ORF (open reading frame) of the corresponding sequence, etc., and also include a combination thereof, but are not limited thereto. 
 The method of modifying the nucleotide sequence on the chromosome may be carried out by inducing a modification on the sequence through deletion, insertion, non-conservative or conservative substitution of a nucleotide sequence or a combination thereof to further attenuate the activity of the enzyme, or may be carried out by replacing the nucleotide sequence with a nucleotide sequence which is improved to have weaker activity or a nucleotide sequence which is improved to have no activity, but is not limited thereto. 
 The method of modifying the expression regulatory sequence may be carried out by inducing a modification on the expression regulatory sequence through deletion, insertion, non-conservative or conservative substitution of a nucleotide sequence, or a combination thereof to further attenuate the activity of the expression regulatory sequence, or may be carried out by replacing the nucleotide sequence with a nucleotide sequence which has weaker activity. The expression regulatory sequence includes a promoter, an operator sequence, a sequence encoding a ribosome-binding site, and a sequence for regulating the termination of transcription and translation, but is not limited thereto. 
 Further, the method of deleting part or all of the polynucleotide encoding the enzyme may be performed by replacing the polynucleotide, which encodes the endogenous target protein within the chromosome via a vector for chromosomal insertion in a microorganism, with a polynucleotide or a marker where part of the nucleotide sequence is deleted. Example of the method of deleting part or all of the polynucleotide may include a method of deleting the polynucleotide via homologous recombination, but is not limited thereto. 
 The polynucleotide may be described as a gene, if it is a collection of polynucleotides that may function. In the present disclosure, the polynucleotide may be used interchangeably with the gene. 
 As used herein, the term “part”, although it may vary depending on the kind of polynucleotide, may specifically refer to 1 nucleotide to 300 nucleotides, more specifically 1 nucleotide to 100 nucleotides, and much more specifically 1 nucleotide to 50 nucleotides, but is not particularly limited thereto. 
 As used herein, the term “putrescine-producing microorganism” or “microorganism having putrescine productivity” refers to a microorganism naturally having putrescine productivity or a microorganism acquiring putrescine productivity through variation in a parent strain having no putrescine productivity or remarkably low putrescine productivity. 
 Specifically, the putrescine-producing microorganism in the present disclosure may refer to a natural form of the microorganism itself, or a microorganism acquiring the putrescine-producing ability by insertion of a foreign polynucleotide related to the putrescine production mechanism or by enhancement or inactivation of the activity of an endogenous gene. 
 More specifically, the putrescine-producing microorganism in the present disclosure may be a “microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium ”. The microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  may include specifically  Corynebacterium glutamicum, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Brevibacterium lactofermentum, Brevibacterium flavum, Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes, Corynebacterium efficiens , etc., but is not limited thereto. Much more specifically, the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  in the present disclosure may be  Corynebacterium glutamicum.    
 The putrescine-producing microorganism may be, but is not particularly limited to, a microorganism in which activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is additionally introduced. The ornithine decarboxylase refers to an enzyme that produces putrescine via decarboxylation of ornithine. The microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  has no putrescine biosynthesis pathway, but may synthesize putrescine by introduction of foreign ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). 
 Further, the putrescine-producing microorganism may be, but is not particularly limited to, a microorganism in which ornithine carbamoyltransferase (ArgF) involved in the synthesis of arginine from ornithine and a protein (NCgl1221) involved in glutamate export are inactivated. 
 Further, the putrescine-producing microorganism may be, but is not particularly limited to, for example, a microorganism in which productivity of ornithine used as a raw material for putrescine biosynthesis is improved by enhancing the activity of acetylglutamate synthase converting glutamate into N-acetylglutamate, ornithine acetyltransferase (ArgJ) converting acetylornithine into ornithine, acetylglutamate kinase (ArgB) converting acetylglutamate into N-acetylglutamyl phosphate, acetyl gamma glutamyl phosphate reductase (ArgC) converting acetylglutamyl phosphate into N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde, acetylornithine aminotransferase (ArgD) converting acetylglutamate semialdehyde into N-acetylornithine, as compared with the endogenous activity thereof, in order to enhance the biosynthesis pathway from glutamate into ornithine. 
 Further, the putrescine-producing microorganism may be, but is not particularly limited to, a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  having putrescine productivity, in which activity of putrescine acetyltransferase is additionally attenuated. 
 Moreover, the putrescine-producing microorganism may be, but is not particularly limited to, a microorganism in which activity of putrescine-exporting protein is enhanced, but is not limited thereto. The enhancement of the activity of putrescine-exporting protein may be enhancement of the activity of a protein having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 87 in the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  having putrescine productivity, but is not limited thereto. 
 Further, the enhancement of the activity of putrescine-exporting protein may be inactivation of the activity of a protein having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 88 in the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  having putrescine productivity, but is not limited thereto. 
 Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method of producing putrescine, the method including the steps of culturing in a medium the putrescine-producing microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium , in which NADPH productivity is increased by (1) enhancing activities of one or more from the group consisting of NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, NAD(P) transhydrogenase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, and NAD +  kinase, by (2) inactivating activities of one or more from the group consisting of gluconate kinase and NAD +  diphosphatase, or by (3) a combination of (1) and (2); and collecting putrescine from the microorganism or the medium obtained in step (b). 
 The “NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase”, “transketolase”, “glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase”, “6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase”, “NAD(P) transhydrogenase”, “nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase”, “NAD kinase”, “enhancement of activity”, “gluconate kinase” “NAD +  diphosphatase”, “inactivation of activity” and “putrescine-producing microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium ” are the same as described above. 
 In the method, the step of culturing the microorganism may be, but is not particularly limited to, performed by known batch culture, continuous culture, fed-batch culture, etc. In this regard, the culture conditions are not particularly limited, but an appropriate pH (e.g., a pH of 5 to 9, specifically a pH of 6 to 8, and most specifically a pH of 6.8) may be adjusted using a basic compound (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or ammonia) or an acidic compound (e.g., phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid). Oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas mixture may be introduced into the culture to maintain aerobic conditions. The temperature of the culture may be maintained at 20° C. to 45° C., specifically, 25° C. to 40° C., and may be cultured for about 10 hours to about 160 hours, but are not limited thereto. The putrescine produced by the culture may be secreted into the medium or may remain in the cells. 
 Additionally, in the culture medium to be used, carbon sources, such as sugars and carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, maltose, molasses, starch, and cellulose), oils and fats (e.g., soybean oil, sunflower seed oil, peanut oil, and coconut oil), fatty acids (e.g., palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linoleic acid), alcohols (e.g., glycerol and ethanol), and organic acids (e.g., acetic acid), may be used individually or in a mixture thereof, but are not limited thereto. Nitrogen sources, such as nitrogen-containing organic compounds (e.g., peptone, yeast extract, meat juice, malt extract, corn steep liquor, soybean flour, and urea) or inorganic compounds (e.g., ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium nitrate), may be used individually or in a mixture thereof, but are not limited thereto. Phosphorous sources, such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, or sodium-containing salts corresponding thereto, may be used individually or in a mixture thereof, but are not limited thereto. Additionally, other essential growth-stimulating substances including metal salts (e.g., magnesium sulfate or iron sulfate), amino acids, and vitamins may be included in the medium. 
 With regard to the method of collecting the putrescine which is produced in the culturing step of the present disclosure, the desired amino acid may be collected from the culture medium by an appropriate method known in the art depending on the culture method. For example, centrifugation, filtration, anion exchange chromatography, crystallization, HPLC, etc., may be used, and the desired putrescine may be collected from the cultured medium or microorganism using an appropriate method known in the art. The method of collecting putrescine may further include a purification step. 
 MODE FOR INVENTION 
 Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail with reference to Examples. However, these Examples are for illustrative purposes only, and the scope of the present disclosure is not intended to be limited by these Examples. 
 Example 1: Production of Putrescine by Introduction of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase 
 Production of putrescine was examined by enhancement of NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in a putrescine-producing microorganism. 
 1-1: Preparation of Vector for Introduction of  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  Subsp.  Bulgaricus  ATCC 11842-Derived NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase into Transposon on Chromosome of Coryneform Microorganism 
   Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp.  Bulgaricus -derived NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was selected as a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with high affinity for  Corynebacterium . Thereafter, to enhance its activity, the following experiment was performed. 
 An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) of  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp.  Bulgaricus  ATCC 11842-derived gapN-encoding Ldb1179 gene were obtained from NIH GenBank. 
 Further, to introduce Ldb1179 gene into the chromosome using a transposon gene region of a microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium , a vector for transformation, pDZTn (WO2009/125992) was used, and cj7 (WO 2006/65095) was used as a promoter. The Ldb1179 gene was amplified as about 1.43 kb of a gene fragment using the chromosome of  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp.  Bulgaricus  ATCC 11842 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 4 by modifying the start codon TTG with ATG (Table 1). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 1 minute and 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of about 1.4 kb was eluted and purified. Further, PCR of CJ7 promoter region was performed using a pair of primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6 under the same conditions to obtain a PCR product. At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The pDZTn vector was treated with XhoI, and then each of the PCR products obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZTn:P(CJ7)-(L).

 1-2: Preparation of Vector for Introduction of  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175-Derived NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of Coryneform Microorganism 
 As a control group of  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp.  Bulgaricus  ATCC 11842-derived gapN, to introduce SMUFR 0590 (Korean Patent No. 1182033) having NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity into  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175, the following experiment was performed. 
 An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 7) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 8) of  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175-derived gapN-encoding SMUFR 0590 gene were obtained from NIH GenBank, and a vector for introducing SMUFR 0590 expressed by CJ7 promoter into the transposon gene was prepared. 
 As in Example 1-1, pDZTn was used as a vector for transformation and cj7 was used as a promoter.  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175-derived SMUFR 0590 gene was amplified as a gene fragment of about 1.7 kb using pECCG117-Pcj7-gapN1 (Korean Patent No. 1182033) as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 9 (Table 2). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 2 minutes. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. The pDZTn vector was treated with XhoI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZTn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S).

 1-3. Fermentation of Putrescine by Introduction of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase into Putrescine-Producing Coryneform Strain 
 <1-3-1> Introduction of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of ATCC 13032-Based Putrescine-Producing Microorganism 
 The plasmid pDZTn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L) prepared in Example 1-1 or the plasmid pDZTn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) prepared in Example 1-2 was introduced into  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM11240P (Korean Patent Publication No. 2013-0003648), KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 (Korean Patent Publication No. 2014-0115244), or KCCM11520P (Korean Patent Publication No. 2014-0049766) by electroporation to obtain each transformant, and each transformant was spread on a BHIS plate medium (37 g/l of Braine heart infusion, 91 g/l of sorbitol, 2% agar) containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside), and cultured to form colonies. From the colonies thus formed, blue colonies were selected to select a strain introduced with the plasmid pDZTn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L) or pDZTn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S). 
 The selected strain was seeded in a CM medium (10 g/l of glucose, 10 g/l of polypeptone, 5 g/l of yeast extract, 5 g/l of beef extract, 2.5 g/l of sodium chloride (NaCl), 2 g/l of urea, pH 6.8), and cultured at 30° C. for 8 hours under shaking. Serial dilution from 10 −4  to 10 −10  was performed and then spread on a solid medium containing X-gal, and cultured to form colonies. From the colonies thus formed, white colonies formed at a relatively low ratio were selected to obtain a putrescine-producing  Corynebacterium glutamicum  introduced with Ldb1179 or SMUFR 0590 gene encoding gapN(L) or gapN(S), respectively. The  Corynebacterium glutamicum  variant strains thus prepared were designated as KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), and KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), respectively. 
 <1-3-2> Introduction of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of ATCC 13869-Based Putrescine-Producing Microorganism

Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strains prepared therefrom were designated as DAB12-b Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), DAB12-b Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), and DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), respectively. 
 <1-3-3> Evaluation of Putrescine Productivity of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Gene-Introduced Coryne Putrescine-Producing Strain 
 In order to examine the production of putrescine by introducing NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene into the putrescine-producing strain, putrescine productivity was compared between  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strains prepared in Examples <1-3-1> and <1-3-2>. 
 In detail, 6 kinds of control groups (KCCM11240P, KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522, KCCM11520P, DAB12-b, DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522, and DAB12-b ΔNCg12523) and 12 kinds of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strains (KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), DAB12-b Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), and DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S)) were spread on CM plate medium containing 1 mM arginine, respectively and cultured at 30° C. for 24 hours. A platinum loop of each strain thus cultured was inoculated into 25 mL of a production medium, and then sampled at 30° C. and 200 rpm for 50 hours. For total 98 hours, sampling was performed. At the time of culturing all the strains, 1 mM arginine was added to each medium. 
 <CM Plate Medium (pH 6.8)> 
 1% glucose, 1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% beef extract, 0.25% sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.2% urea, 100 μl of 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 2% agar, pH 6.8 (based on 1 L of distilled water). 
 <Production Medium (pH 7.0)> 
 8% glucose, 0.25% soybean protein, 0.50% corn steep solids, 4% ammonium sulfate ((NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ), 0.1% potassium phosphate (KH 2 PO 4 ), 0.05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO 4 .7H 2 O), 0.15% urea, 100 μg of biotin, 3 mg of thiamine.HCl, 3 mg of calcium-pantothenic acid, 3 mg of nicotinamide, 5% calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) (based on 1 L of distilled water).

 Similarly, in Table 4, KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), and DAB12-b Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) which are 4 kinds of KCCM11240P or DAB12-b-based gapN-enhanced mutant strains showed putrescine productivity equivalent to or higher than that of the control group, and KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) which are 8 kinds of KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522-, KCCM11520P-, DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522-, DAB12-b ΔNCg12523-based gapN-enhanced mutant strains having enhanced putrescine export ability showed much increased putrescine productivity. 
 Accordingly, it was confirmed that when the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was enhanced in  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 or 13869-derived putrescine-producing strain, productivity and production were all increased, and when the putrescine export ability was enhanced together, the increase was further increased. 
 1-4: Comparison of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity in Putrescine Strains 
 NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity of  L. delbrueckii  subsp.  Bulgaricus -derived gapN(L) or  Streptococcus mutans -derived gapN(S) was compared in Ldb1179 gene or SMUFR 0590 gene-introduced KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L) or KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) strain. As a control group, KCCM11240P strain having no gapN gene was used. Each strain was cultured in a complex plate medium containing 1 mM arginine for about one day, and then cultured in a seed medium containing 1 mM arginine at an initial OD 600 =0.2. The cells were recovered at OD 600 =10. 
 <Seed Medium> 
 20 g of glucose, 10 g of peptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of urea, 4 g of KH 2 PO 4 , 8 g of K 2 HPO 4 , 0.5 g of MgSO 4  7 H 2 O, 100 μg of biotin, 1000 μg of thiamine-HCl (based on 1 L of process water) 
 A known method (A. Soukri et al., Protein Expression and Purification; 25; (2002) 519-529) was used to measure NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and the results are shown in Table 5 below.

 As shown in Table 5, when the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity of  Streptococcus mutans -derived gapN(S)-introduced KCCM 11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) was regarded as 100, the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity of  L. delbrueckii  subsp.  Bulgaricus -derived gapN(L)-introduced KCCM 11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L) strain was 1.5 times higher, indicating that as the NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was higher and the amount of NADPH provided was larger, putrescine productivity and production were increased.

Two gene fragments of about 0.5 kb were amplified using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 12 and 13 and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 14 and 15 (Table 6). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. The pDZ vector was treated with XbaI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZ-1′tkt(ATG).

 3-2: Co-Replacement of Promoter and Start Codon for G6PD Enhancement 
 <3-2-1> Preparation of G6PD Promoter and Start Codon-Co-Replaced Vector 
 To enhance G6PD activity, a vector for introducing CJ7 promoter before the start codon of the gene encoding the same on the chromosome and replacing the start codon GTG with ATG at the same time was prepared. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZ was used. Two gene fragments of about 0.5 kb were amplified using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 22 and 23 and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 31 and 26 (Table 13). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. CJ7 promoter region was obtained using a pair of primers of SEQ ID NOS: 24 and 6 by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The pDZ vector was treated with XbaI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZ-P(CJ7)-1′zwf(ATG).

 Example 4: Putrescine Production Through 6PGD Enhancement 
 The putrescine production was examined by enhancing 6PGD (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) activity in putrescine-producing strains. 
 4-1: Preparation of Vector for Introducing 6PGD into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of Coryneform Microorganism 
 To enhance activity of NCg11396 having 6PGD activity, a vector for introducing NCg11396 expressed by CJ7 promoter into the transposon gene on the chromosome was prepared. An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 32) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 33) of NCg11396 encoding Gnd having  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032-derived 6PGD activity were obtained from NIH GenBank. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZTn was used in order to introduce the gene into the transposon gene on the chromosome using the transposon gene region of the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium . A gene fragment of about 1.45 kb was amplified using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 34 and 35 (Table 16). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 1 minute and 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. CJ7 promoter region was obtained using a pair of primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6 by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The pDZ vector was treated with XbaI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZTn:P(CJ7)-1′gnd.

 In detail, 4 kinds of control groups (KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522, KCCM11520P, DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522, and DAB12-b ΔNCg12523) and 4 kinds of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strains (KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gnd, KCCM11520P Tn:P(CJ7)-gnd, DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gnd, and DAB12-b ΔNCg12523 Tn:P(CJ7)-gnd) were spread on CM plate medium containing 1 mM arginine, respectively and cultured at 30° C. for 24 hours. A platinum loop of each strain thus cultured was inoculated into 25 mL of a production medium, and then cultured under shaking at 30° C. and 200 rpm for 98 hours. At the time of culturing all the strains, 1 mM arginine was added to each medium.

 Example 5: Putrescine Production Through NAD(P) Transhydrogenase Introduction 
 Putrescine production according to NADPH supply was examined by enhancing NAD(P) transhydrogenase activity in putrescine-producing  Corynebacterium glutamicum.    
 5-1: Preparation of Vector for Introducing  E. coli  W3110-Derived NAD(P) Transhydrogenase into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of Coryneform Microorganism 
 To enhance expression of Y75_p1579 and Y75_p1578 encoding PntAB having  E. coli  W3110-derived NAD(P) transhydrogenase activity, a vector for introducing Y75_p1579 and Y75p1578 gene expressed by CJ7 promoter into the transposon gene on the chromosome was prepared.  E. coli  W3110-derived NAD(P) transhydrogenase forms a complex of PntA and PntB. An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 39) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 40) of PntA-encoding Y75p1579 gene and an amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 41) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 42) of PntB-encoding Y75 p1578 gene were obtained from NIH GenBank. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZTn was used in order to introduce the gene into the transposon gene on the chromosome using the transposon gene region of the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium . A gene fragment of about 2.92 kb was amplified using the chromosome of  E. coli  W3110 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 43 and 44 (Table 19). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 3 minutes. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. CJ7 promoter region was obtained using a pair of primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6 by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The pDZTn vector was treated with XhoI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZTn:P(CJ7)-pntAB.

 Example 6-1: Preparation of Vector for Deletion of Gluconate Kinase Gene NCg12399 or NCg12905 
 <6-1-1> Preparation of Vector for NCg12399 Deletion 
 The chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 includes NCg12399 and NCg12905 genes having gluconate kinase activity. Of the two genes having gluconate kinase activity, a vector for NCg12399 gene deletion was prepared. An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 45) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 46) of NCg12399 gene of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain were obtained from NIH GenBank. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZ was used. Two gene fragments of about 0.5 kb were amplified using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 47 and 48 and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 49 and 50 (Table 21). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. The pDZ vector was treated with XbaI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZ-1′NCg12399(K/O).

 9-1: Preparation of Vector for Introduction of  E. coli  W3110-Derived Nicotinate Phosphoribosyltransferase (EC.2.4.2.11) into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of Coryneform Microorganism 
 A vector for introducing Y75_p0903 encoding pncB having  E. coli  W3110-derived nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase activity into the transposon gene on the chromosome was prepared. An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 61) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 62) of Y75_p0903 gene encoding pncB having  E. coli  W3110-derived nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase activity were obtained from NIH GenBank. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZTn was used to introduce the gene into the chromosome using the transposon gene region of the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium . A gene fragment of about 1.2 kb of Y75_p0903 gene was amplified using the chromosome of  E. coli  W3110 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 63 and 64 (Table 26). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 1 minute and 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. Further, the CJ7 promoter region was subjected to PCR using a pair of primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6 under the same conditions to obtain a PCR product. At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The pDZTn vector was treated with XhoI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZTn:P(CJ7)-pncB(Eco).

 An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 73) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 74) of NCg10744 gene having NAD +  diphosphatase activity were obtained from NIH GenBank. To attenuate NAD +  diphosphatase activity, a vector for NCg10744 gene deletion was prepared. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZ was used. Two gene fragments of about 0.5 kb were amplified using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 75 and 76 and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 77 and 78 (Table 30). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. The pDZ vector was treated with XbaI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZ-1′NCg10744(K/O).

 Example 11: Putrescine Production Through Introduction of NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase and Enhancement of NAD +  Kinase 
 Putrescine production was examined by enhancing both NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and NAD +  kinase activity in the putrescine-producing strain. 
 11-1: Preparation of Vector for Introduction of NAD +  Kinase into Transposon Gene on Chromosome of Coryneform Microorganism 
 To enhance activity of NCg11358 having NAD +  kinase activity, a vector for introducing NCg11358 expressed by CJ7 promoter into the transposon gene on the chromosome was prepared. An amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 81) and a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 82) of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032-derived NCg11358 gene were obtained from NIH GenBank. 
 In a specific Example of the present disclosure, a vector for transformation, pDZTn was used to introduce the gene into the transposon gene on the chromosome using the transposon gene region of the microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium . A gene fragment of about 0.96 kb was amplified using the chromosome of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 strain as a template and primers of SEQ ID NOS: 83 and 84 (Table 32). At this time, PCR reaction was performed by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 1 minute. This PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, and a band of a desired size was eluted and purified. CJ7 promoter region was obtained using a pair of primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6 by repeating 30 cycles of denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 55° C. for 30 seconds, and extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The pDZ vector was treated with XbaI, and then the PCR product obtained above was subjected to fusion cloning. The fusion cloning was performed using an In-Fusion® HD cloning kit (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pDZTn:P(CJ7)-1′ppnk.

 The ATCC 13032-based putrescine-producing strain, KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) prepared in Example 1-4-1 was transformed with the plasmid pDZTn:P(CJ7)-1′ppnk prepared in Example 11-1 in the same manner as in <1-4-1> to prepare a strain in which NCg11358 gene was introduced into the transposon. The  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strain selected therefrom was designated as KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) Tn:P(CJ7)-1′ppnk. 
 Similarly, the ATCC 13869-based putrescine-producing strain, DAB-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 P(CJ7)-gapN(S) prepared in Example 1-4-2 was transformed with the plasmid pDZTn:P(CJ7)-2′ppnk prepared in Example 11-1 in the same manner as in <1-4-1> to prepare a strain in which NCg11358 gene was introduced into the transposon. The  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strain selected therefrom was designated as DAB-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) Tn:P(CJ7)-2′ppnK. 
 <11-2-2> Evaluation of Putrescine Productivity of  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175-Derived NADP-Dependent Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity-Introduced and NAD +  Kinase Activity-Enhanced Strain 
 In order to examine putrescine production when NCg11358 having NAD +  kinase activity was introduced in the form of being expressed by CJ7 promoter into the transposon gene on the chromosome in order to facilitate supply of NADP as a precursor of  Corynebacterium glutamicum  NADPH, the  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strain prepared in Example 11-2-1 was examined for putrescine productivity. 
 In detail, two control groups (KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 and DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522), two mutant strains in which  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175-derived gapN was introduced (KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S), DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S)), and  Corynebacterium glutamicum  mutant strains (KCCM11240P P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) Tn:P(CJ7)-1′ppnK and DAB12-b P(CJ7)-NCg12522 Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(S) Tn:P(CJ7)-2′ppnK) of 4 kinds of mutant strains in which  Streptococcus mutans  ATCC 25175-derived gapN was introduced and  Corynebacterium glutamicum -derived ppnK was introduced were compared for putrescine productivity from the final products which were cultured for 98 hours in the same manner as in Example 1-4-3.

 As shown in Table 33, it was confirmed that when NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapN was introduced and NCg11358 encoding  Corynebacterium glutamicum -derived NAD +  kinase ppnK was enhanced in  Corynebacterium glutamicum  ATCC 13032 or 13869-derived putrescine-producing strain, putrescine productivity was slightly increased. 
 In the present disclosure, it was confirmed that the  Corynebacterium glutamicum  strain, in which Ldb1179 was introduced into the transposon of the putrescine-producing microorganism of the genus  Corynebacterium  having deletion of the acetyl putrescine synthetic pathway to enhance NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, is able to produce putrescine with high yield and high productivity, and the strain was designated as KCCM11240P Tn:P(CJ7)-gapN(L), CC01-0811, and then deposited at the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (KCCM) which is the international depository authority under the Budapest Treaty on Jun. 29, 2017 with the Accession No. KCCM12052P. 
 Based on the above description, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be implemented in a different specific form without changing the technical spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Therefore, it should be understood that the above embodiment is not limitative, but illustrative in all aspects. The scope of the disclosure is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalents of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the claims.
