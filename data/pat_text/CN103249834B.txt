 Use TMHMM program (" Prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins "；TMHMM
Server v.2.0, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, BioCentrum-DTU, Technical
University of Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark) carry out cross-film [" the TM "] structure in EgD9eS
The analysis in territory.Six transbilayer helixs of predictive display (corresponding to amino acid residue 32-51,66-88,114-136,156-175,
188-206,221-243), N-and C-end is respectively positioned on Cytoplasm side.When with above-mentioned TMHMM program to Ot_elo2, Ig_elo1,
When Pav_elo2 with Tp_elo2 carries out similar analysis, the quantity of transbilayer helix is 4 to 8.Therefore, in order to strengthen these
The prediction of change, employs following function information. 
 1. the motif rich in histidine [Q/H] xxHH(" His-box " of high conservative) shown for Ig_d9e
The optimized enzymatic activity of (SEQ ID NO:42) is requisite, but and be not directly responsible for substrate specificity (Qi et al.,
FEBS Letters, 547:137-139(2003)).Therefore, this effectively implys that His-box(corresponds to the ammonia in EgD9eS
Base acid residue 134-138) relevant with avtive spot；Further, it should be positioned at the Cytoplasm side of the protein folded or it is attached
Closely so that substrate can be close to avtive spot. 
 The position of the most the high conservatives with charged residues is present in the C-terminal of EgD9eS.They may be with activity
Relevant, therefore C-terminal is likely located at the Cytoplasm side of the protein folded. 
 And predict the TMHMM of transbilayer helix between amino acid residue 114-136 and between amino acid residue 156-175
Result is contrary, and above-mentioned consideration shows, the not cross-film of the sequence between residue 114-136, because histidine box can not be positioned at film
Outwards one side.If C-terminal is positioned at Cytoplasm side, then the TM domain between the 156-175 predicted can not cross-film.Because
The substrate extending enzyme is very hydrophobic, and it is likely to be allocated into lipid bilayer.Avtive spot (including histidine box) can be deposited
It is the surface of film or the surface of closely film. 
 Therefore, predict that the two water repellent region is (that is, corresponding to amino acid residue 114-136 and amino acid residue herein
156-175) it is positioned near inner membrance individual or its, to guarantee that avtive spot is close to film.Final film for EgD9eS prediction
Topological model shows in Figure 16 A.Specifically, each vertical cylinder represents a transmembrane segment, and the circle of each level
Cylinder represents the hydrophobic extension being positioned near inner membrance individual or its.Histidine box (that is, corresponding to amino acid residue 134-138)
Interior conservative glutamine [Q] and histidine [H] residue represent with small circle.Finally, " interior " represents cytoplasmic space, and
" outward " represents periplasmic space. 
 Although conservative mode Analysis and Identification group III Δ 9 fatty acid elongase (that is, Ea_d9e [SEQ IDNO:34], Eg_
D9e [SEQ ID NO:32], E398_d9e [SEQ ID NO:38] and Ig_d9e [SEQ ID NO:42]) in be predicted to be impact
11 different amino acid residues of enzymatic activity, the result from the topological model of prediction further limit the residue of candidate.
Specifically, infer that those positions important for enzymatic activity must be positioned at the Cytoplasm side at avtive spot place or it is attached
Closely.Amino acid residue 47,54 and 192 could not meet this condition, and therefore they are assumed to be activity regulation Δ 9 being extended to enzyme
Can not be important. 
 Based on above-mentioned principle, the Candidate Residues of Δ 9 elongase activity of EgD9eS may be interfered significantly on by from SEQ ID
258 residues in the full length protein of NO:3 are reduced to only 8 residues, corresponding to position 22,101,107,111,115,
161,182 and 242.These eight positions are proposed as target for direct mutagenesis, to improve the substrate conversion efficiency of EgD9eS.Under
The experimental data targeting position 107 of literary composition.

 The exploitation of the topological model of example 11A: euglena gracilis (Euglena gracilis) Δ 5 desaturase [" EgD5 "] 
 
 In order to Δ 5 desaturase [" EgD5 " from euglena gracilis (E.gracilis) is better anticipated；United States Patent (USP) 7,
678,560；SEQ ID NO:184 and 185] in the possible importance of HDASH motif, logic-based and the exploitation of analysis hereafter
Topological model (Figure 18). 
 First, TMHMM program (" Prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins " is used；
TMHMM Server v.2.0, Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, BioCentrum-DTU,
Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800Lyngby, Denmark) carry out the transmembrane structure to EgD5
The analysis in territory.Six transbilayer helixs of predictive display are (corresponding to amino acid residue 103-125,130-152,165-187,234-
256,280-302 and 306-328), N-and C-end is respectively positioned on the Cytoplasm side of film. 
 The TMHMM using the congener of following EgD5 to be similar to analyzes: GenBank accession number AAT09160 is [little
Nitzschia closterium minutissima (Nitzschia closterium f.minutissima)], GenBank accession number BAG71007
[Oblongichytrium sp.SEK347] and GenBank accession number AAL92562 [Phaeodactylum (Phaeodactylum
Tricornutum)].For every kind of congener, it was predicted that four kinds of transmembrane segments, corresponding to for EgD5 prediction the first two and
Latter two membrane spaning domain. 
 The fatty acid desaturase that film combines belongs to three films being characterized rich in the motif of histidine (His-rich)
Double iron protein superfamilies: HX (3-4) H(SEQ ID NO:186 and 187), HX (2-3) HH(SEQ ID NO:188 and 189) and (H/
Q) X (2-3) HH(SEQ ID NO:190 and 191).These are rich in the most predicted Cytoplasm side being positioned at film of residue of histidine, and
And shown be important (Shanklin, J. et al., Biochemistry, 33:12787-12794 for enzymatic activity
(1994)；Shanklin, J. and Cahoon, E.B., Annu.Rev.Plant Physiol.PlantMol.Biol., 49:611-
641(1998)).In EgD5, first region rich in histidine (HDASH [SEQ ID NO:183]) is positioned at leap amino
Before the transmembrane segment of the 3rd prediction of acid residue 165-187, and second (HIMRHH [SEQ of the region rich in histidine
ID NO:189]) be positioned at this transmembrane segment after.If above-mentioned 3rd transmembrane segment cross-film really, then second rich in group ammonia
The region of acid will be located in periplasmic space thus prevents it to participate in ferrum-avtive spot.Therefore it is presumed that the 3rd
Individual transmembrane segment (amino acid residue 165-187) and the 4th transmembrane segment (amino acid residue 234-256) the most not cross-film.This with
TMHMM for three kinds of Δ 5 desaturase congeners (that is, GenBank accession number AAT09160, BAG71007 and AAL92562)
Prediction is consistent. 
 Owing to Δ 5 desaturase substrate (that is, DGLA, ETA) is very hydrophobic, it is assumed to be and is likely to distribute to fat pair
In Ceng.Similarly, it is assumed that from three rich in histidine bunch assemble avtive spots will likely be on film surface or its near.
Therefore, initially by TMHMM be predicted as crossing over film, be found the 3rd between residue 165-187 and 234-256 and the respectively
Four transmembrane segments, are predicted to be on the contrary and are positioned at film near surface, to guarantee that avtive spot is positioned near film.Amino acid residue
Trans-membrane region at 103-125,130-152,280-302 and 306-328 is still predicted such as TMHMM. 
 Therefore, the final topological model for EgD5 prediction is shown in Figure 18.Vertical cylinder represents that cross-film is tied
Structure territory, and the cylinder of level represents not cross-film, and it is in the region of two very hydrophobic near intimal surface.Circle
Corresponding to relating to the histidine residues of avtive spot by inference.Also identify HPGG(SEQ ID NO:181) motif and HDASH
(SEQ ID NO:183) motif.Finally, " interior " represents cytoplasmic space, and " outward " represents periplasmic space.
