 Preferred embodiment 
 Hereinafter, present disclosure will be more fully described with reference to the following examples.But, these embodiments only go out
It is not intended to be to be restricted to such embodiments in illustrative purpose, and present disclosure. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 1：YhhS mainly assists the preparation of transport protein superfamily (MFS) transport protein variant 
 
 In order to improve the activity of OPS- outputs albumen (output albumen (exporter)) in order in improving and producing OPS bacterial strains
OPS- output activity, transport protein superfamily (MFS) transport protein (SEQ ID NO are mainly assisted for YhhS：23) --- one
Plant certified OPS- outputs albumen recently, and yhhS (SEQ ID NO：24) --- its gene is encoded, variant is prepared.In detail
Process is described below. 
 First, the library of yhhS genetic mutations is built.Therefore, based on the e. coli k12 W3110 as template
(ATCC27325) genomic DNA, using gene-specific primer to (SEQ ID NO：7 and 8) carry out random mutagenesis PCR
(JENA fallibility PCR).PCLPrhtB carriers, wherein rhtB promoters (SEQ will be entered by the thus prepared gene fragment clone of mutagenesis
ID NO：13) --- its experience is using gene-specific primer to (SEQ ID NO：14 and PCR 15) --- it is inserted into
The SacI-EcoRV sites of pCL1920 carriers (GenBank AB236930).Specifically, cut using EcoRV and PstI
PCLPrhtB carriers, and then will using In-fusion Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.)
Gene fragment clone from mutagenesis enters wherein.This is carried out 10 minutes at being cloned in 50 DEG C, so as to complete pCL PrhtB yhhS
The structure of the plasmid library of variant. 
 Screened via high flow capacity screening (HTS) in the recombinant plasmid library for so building.Specifically, for screening
Platform bacterial strain is CA07-0012 (KCCM11121P), its be modified it is endogenous in Wild type E. coli strain W3110 to reduce
Active recombinant microorganism (the Korean patent No. 10-1381048 of phosphoserine phosphatase (SerB)；U.S. Patent application is public
Cloth 2012-0190081). 
 Then, in order to obtain the variant with the OPS- output activity for improving, the plasmid library for so building is worn via electricity
Hole is transformed into platform bacterial strain CA07-0012, is cultivated in the culture medium comprising excessive OPS, and selects wherein growth inhibition
Three bacterium colonies being released from.Then, plasmid is obtained and is analyzed via sequencing technologies from the bacterium colony of three selections. 
 Therefore, selection participates in three kinds of yhhS variants of growth inhibition removal, and these variants point under the conditions of OPS is added
It is not named as yhhS M2, yhhS M25 and yhhS M45. 
 After analysis yhhS M2, the nucleotide sequence of yhhS M25 and yhhS M45, confirm that yhhS M2 have by SEQ
ID NO：1 amino acid sequence for representing, yhhS M25 have by SEQ ID NO：3 amino acid sequences for representing, and yhhS M45
With by SEQ ID NO：5 amino acid sequences for representing.

 As shown in table 2 above, bacterial strain introduce have present disclosure yhhS variants in the case of, these bacterial strains with
The bacterial strain that introducing has wild type yhhS genes is compared, it is shown that remarkable result, shows that OPS productions increased 128% and arrive
165%.Specifically, respectively compared with the increase of wild type, yhhS M2 variants show 128% increase, and yhhS M25 show
165% increase, and yhhS M45 variants show 156% increase. 
 
 2-2. has the bacterial strain of enhanced YhhSMFS transport proteins using the strain construction with enhanced SerA and SerC 
 And assess product OPS abilities 
 
 In order to reconfirm the activity of the yhhS variants of present disclosure, CA07-0022/pCL-Prmf-serA* is used
(G336V)-serC (KCCM11103P, Korean patent No. 10-1381048), it is the product OPS with the product OPS abilities for improving
Bacterial strain, as OPS biosynthesis pathways there is enhanced D-3- phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (SerA) and 3- phosphoserines to turn
Ammonia enzyme (SerC) activity. 
 In order to build pCL-Prmf-serA (G336V)-serC_PrhtB- genophores, based on the pCL- as template
PrhtB-yhhS variants, use primer pair (SEQ ID NO：9 and 10) each in yhhS variants expanded, and will be raw
The HindIII restriction sites of pCL-Prmf-serA* (G336V)-serC carriers are cloned into thing. 
 Specifically, by bacterial strain, --- each plasmid is converted by conventional use of impulse method in the bacterial strain --- puts down
Plate is seeded in solid LB media and the then overnight incubation in 33 DEG C of incubators.To be cultivated in solid LB media
The inoculation at night enters in the 25mL potency culture mediums shown in table 1 above and in 34.5 DEG C of incubators in the speed of 200rpm
Cultivated 48 hours under rate.Result shows in following table 3.

YhhS variants can be efficiently used for OPS production. 
 
 2-3. according on chromosome promoter intensity build with enhanced YhhS MFS transport proteins bacterial strain and 
 OPS abilities are produced in assessment 
 
 From experiment above further, in order to confirm when yhhS variants are introduced on chromosome, OPS- outputs activity is
No raising, its own promoter of microorganism is replaced using pCJ1 promoters (Korean patent No. 10-0620092), and structure draws
Enter to have the bacterial strain of the variant of present disclosure and assess their product OPS abilities.PCJ1 promoters and variant are introduced into chromosome
Carried out by conventional use of method in this area.First, in order to convert, as initial step, by impulse method (Appl
Microbiol Biotechnol.1999 Oct；52(4)：Recombinant vector 541-5) is inserted into CA07-0022/pCL-Prmf-
SerA* (G336V)-serC (KCCM11103P, Korean patent No. 10-1381048) --- produce OPS bacterial strains.Then, by homologous
The bacterial strain of the restructuring insertion chromosome of sequence is selected in the culture medium comprising 25mg/L kanamycins.So selection is initial
(primary) then the second step that bacterial strain experience is exchanged, and select bacterial strain --- in the bacterial strain, pCJ1 promoters and change
Body is replaced and carrier is removed. 
 Finally, by carrying out using primer pair (SEQ ID NO：11 and PCR 12) confirms opening for the bacterial strain that there is conversion
The displacement of mover and variant. 
 Every kind of bacterial strain flat board is seeded in solid LB media and the then overnight incubation in 33 DEG C of incubators.Will be
The inoculation of overnight incubation enters in the 25mL potency culture mediums shown in table 1 above and at 34.5 DEG C in LB solid mediums
Cultivated 40 hours under the speed of 200rpm in incubator.Result shows in following table 4. 
 Table 4 
 
 
 
 As shown in table 4 above, it has been confirmed that when the activity of each protein variant on chromosome increases, passing through
The amount of the OPS productions of protein variant is demonstrated by 172% most compared with the amount of OPS productions of the bacterial strain for having wild type yhhS is introduced
Big value.
