 Figure 1A and Figure 1B together illustrate multiple approach of ω -3/ ω -6 aliphatic acid production, as mentioned below.All approach
It is required for initially passing through the desaturase of Δ -12 by oleate conversion into linoleic acid [" LA "]（First ω -6 aliphatic acid）.Then, make
Make substrate with " Δ -9 extends the enzyme/desaturase of Δ -8 approach " and with LA, the aliphatic acid of long-chain omega -6 is formed as follows：1）By Δ -9
Extend enzyme and LA is changed into eicosadienoic acid [" EDA "]；2）EDA is changed into by two height-γ-flax by the desaturase of Δ -8
Sour [" DGLA "]；3）DGLA is changed into by arachidonic acid [" ARA "] by the desaturase of Δ -5；4）By C 20/22 Extending enzyme will
ARA changes into docosatetraenoic acid [" DTA "]；And, 5）DTA is changed into by docosapentaenoic by the desaturase of Δ -4
Sour [" DPAn-6 "]. 
 " Δ -9 extends the enzyme/desaturase of Δ -8 approach " can also be used alpha-linolenic acid [" ALA "] and be produced by below as substrate
Long-chain omega-fatty acid：1）LA is changed into by ALA, first omega-fatty acid by the desaturase of Δ -15；2）By Δ-prolong
Stretch enzyme and ALA is changed into eicosatrienoic acid [" ETrA "]；3）ETrA is changed into by Eicosatetraenoic by the desaturase of Δ -8
Sour [" ETA "]；4）ETA is changed into by eicosapentaenoic acid [" EPA "] by the desaturase of Δ -5；5）By C 20/22 Extending enzyme will
EPA changes into clupanodonic acid [" DPA "]；And 6）DPA is changed into by two dodecahexaenes by the desaturase of Δ -4
Sour [" DHA "].Optionally, ω -6 aliphatic acid can be changed into omega-fatty acid.For example, by the desaturase of Δ -17 activity, point
ETA and EPA is not produced from DGLA and ARA. 
 Replacement approach for biosynthesis ω -3/ ω -6 aliphatic acid utilizes the desaturase of Δ -6 and C 18/20 Extend enzyme（That is,
" desaturase of Δ -6/Δ -6 extends enzymatic pathway "）.More specifically, LA and ALA can be changed into respectively by the desaturase of Δ -6
GLA and parinaric acid [" STA "]；Then, C 18/20 Extend enzyme GLA to be changed into DGLA and/or STA is changed into ETA.With
Form downstream PUFA as described above afterwards. 
 It is expected need to be introduced in specific host biology be used to produce the specific function of ω -3/ ω -6 aliphatic acid will depend on
Host cell（And its primary PFUA features and/or desaturase/extension enzyme feature）, substrate utilizability and required whole product
Thing.For example in some embodiments, the expression that Δ -9 extends enzyme/desaturase approach of Δ -8 is preferred, but it can suppress
The desaturase of Δ -6/Δ -6 extends the expression of enzymatic pathway, because lacking GLA and/or STA via the PUFA that the former produces. 
 Those skilled in the art is possible to the every kind of enzyme needed for identifying various coding ω -3/ ω -6 fatty acid biologicals synthesis
Candidate gene.Useful desaturase and extension enzyme sequence can derive from any source, for example, being isolated from natural origin（Come
From bacterium, algae, fungi, plant, animal etc.）, via semi-synthetic approach produce or de novo formation.Although introduce host go satisfy
Specific source with enzyme and elongase gene is not critical to, but selection is specific with desaturase or elongase activity
The Consideration of polypeptide includes：1）The substrate specificity of polypeptide；2）Whether polypeptide or its component are rate-limiting enzymes；3）Desaturase or
Extend enzyme and expect whether PUFA is required for synthesis；4）Co-factor needed for polypeptide；And/or 5）Polypeptide generation after whether
It is modified（For example modified by kinases or prenyltransferase）.The polypeptide of expression preferably has with it in host
The compatible parameter of the biochemical environment of the position in cell（More details are referring to United States Patent (USP) 7,238,482）. 
 The transformation efficiency for considering every kind of specific desaturase and/or extending enzyme also will be useful.More specifically, due to
Substrate seldom can be changed into product, the final lipid of the unpurified oil produced by host cell by every kind of enzyme with 100% efficiency
The mixing of various PUFA that feature typically will be made up of desired ω -3/ ω -6 aliphatic acid and various upstream PUFA intermediate products
Thing.Therefore, when the biosynthesis for making desired aliphatic acid is optimized, the transformation efficiency of every kind of enzyme is also intended to the change for considering
Amount.

Candidate gene can be according to the document that can disclose acquisition（Such as GenBank）, patent document and to produce PUFA abilities biology
Experimental analysis identify.These genes will be suitable for introduce into specific host organism, so that the biology can synthesize
PUFA or the biological PUFA synthesis of enhancing. 
 Once aliphatic acid synthesizes in vivo（Including saturation and undersaturated aliphatic acid and short chain and long-chain fat
Acid）, they may be impregnated in TAG.TAG is the main storage unit of aliphatic acid. 
 The most of desaturases of Δ -5 identified so far have the unique ability that DGLA is changed into ARA, and will
ETA changes into the secondary activity of EPA.Various desaturases of Δ -5 have been disclosed in open source literature and patent document.It is based on
The evolution of desaturase, P.Sperling et al. detail the general characteristic of the desaturase of Δ -5（Prostaglandins
Leukot.Essent.Fatty Acids, 68:73–95（2003）.Together with Δ -6, Δ -8 and the desaturase of Δ -4, it is known that
The desaturase of Δ -5 is long-chain PUFA " front end " desaturase（Double bond and fatty acid acyl that wherein desaturation previously there are
It is opposite with the desaturation that methyl is oriented between the carboxyl terminal of base）.These desaturases are characterised by three histidine box [H
(X) 3-4 H（SEQ ID NO:1 and 2）、H(X) 2-3 HH（SEQ ID NO:3 and 4）With H/Q (X) 2-3 HH（SEQ ID NO:5 and 6）],
And it is cytochrome b 5 The member of super race is condensed, because they have the cytochrome b for condensing in N-terminal 5 Rise in domain, the domain

 The topological model of the desaturase [" EgD5 "] of exploitation euglena gracilis Δ -5 
 
 In order to be better anticipated in the desaturase of euglena gracilis Δ -5 [" EgD5 "；U.S. Patent application 7,678,560] in
The possible importance of HDASH motifs, a kind of topological model is developed based on logic below and analysis（Fig. 2）. 
 First, the membrane-spanning domain of EgD5 is analyzed using TMHMM programs（“Prediction of transmembrane
helices in proteins”；TMHMM Server v.2.0, Center for Biological Sequence
Analysis, BioCentrum-DTU, Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800Lyngby,
Denmark）.Prediction indicates six transmembrane helical regions（Amino acid residue 103-125,130-152,165-187,234-256,
280-302 and 306-328）, both its N-terminal and C-terminal are positioned at the cytoplasm side of film. 
 Similar TMHMM is carried out using following EgD5 homologues to analyze：GenBank accession number AAT09160 [small crescent water chestnuts
Shape algae（Nitzchia closterium f.minutissima）], GenBank accession number BAG71007
[Oblongichytrium sp.SEK347] and GenBank accession number AAL92562 [Phaeodactylum tricornutums（Phaeodactylum
tricornutum）].For every kind of homologue, prediction has four transmembrane segments, and they correspond to the first two of the EgD5 of prediction
With latter two membrane-spanning domain. 
 Film combination fatty acid desaturase belongs to the super race of the iron protein of film two, and the protein is characterised by three
Rich in histidine（Rich in His）Motif：HX （3-4） H（SEQ ID NO:1 and 2）、HX （2-3） HH（SEQ ID NO:3 and 4）With
(H/Q)X （2-3） HH（SEQ ID NO:5 and 6）.Predicted these residues rich in His are located at the cytoplasm face and of film
Display is important to enzymatic activity（Shanklin, J. et al., Biochemistry, 33:12787-12794（1994）；
Shanklin, J., and Cahoon, E.B., Annu.Rev.Plant Physiol.Plant Mol.Biol., 49:611-641
（1998））.In EgD5, the first region rich in His（HDASH[SEQ ID NO:8]）Positioned at the 3rd cross-film piece of prediction
Before section, fragment spans amino acid residue 165-187, and the second region rich in His（HIMRHH[SEQ ID NO:4]）Position
After this transmembrane segment.If the 3rd transmembrane segment actually cross-film, the second region rich in His will be positioned at pericentral siphon
In space --- therefore prevent it from participating in iron avtive spot.Therefore it is presumed that the 3rd transmembrane segment（Amino acid residue 165-
187）With the 4th transmembrane segment（Amino acid residue 234-256）It is not cross-film.This is same with to three desaturases of Δ -5
Source thing（That is, GenBank accession number AAT09160, BAG71007 and AAL92562）TMHMM predictions it is consistent. 
 Because the desaturase substrate of Δ -5（That is, DGLA, ETA）It is high hydrophobicity, it is assumed that it may separate in lipid
In bilayer.Similarly, it is assumed that the avtive spot being combined into by three clusters rich in His will likely appear in film surface or connect very much
Nearly film surface.Therefore, the 3rd and the 4th transmembrane segment are respectively appeared between residue 165-187 and 234-256, TMHMM
Initially predict that they are located adjacent to film surface and sentence ensure avtive spot close to film rather than predicting them across film.In amino acid
Trans-membrane region at residue 103-125,130-152,280-302 and 306-328 is consistent with what TMHMM was predicted. 
 Therefore, the final topology model for EgD5 predictions is shown in Figure 2.Vertical cylinder represents membrane-spanning domain, and level
Cylinder represents that two cross-film but are not located adjacent to the high hydrophobicity region of intimal surface.Circle corresponds to prediction in active sites
The His residues being related in point.Also identify HPGG（SEQ ID NO:7）Motif and HDASH（SEQ ID NO:8）The position of motif
