 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 1. Field of the Invention 
 The present invention relates to a novel mannanase produced from  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13 
 2. Description of the Related Art 
 Cellulose and hemicellulose decomposing microorganisms are found in soil and compost related ecosystem, and digestive canals of herbivores and invertebrates. These microorganisms play an important role in biological transformation of biomass (Flint et al., 2008, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 6, 121-131; Kim et al., 2009, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 75, 7275-7279; Perez et al., 2002, Int. Microbiol. 5, 53-63). 
 Among structural polysaccharides found in plant biomass, β-1,4-mannan is the hemicellulose of softwood and is often found in various lignocellulose biomasses as heteropolysaccharide containing glucose and/or galactose units (van Zyl et al., 2010, Proc. Biochem. 45, 1203-1213). During the biodegradation of cellulose and xylan, mannan polysaccharide is also completely degraded by the cooperation of various hydrolases such as β-mannanase, β-mannosidase, β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase, and acetyl mannan esterase, according to the previous reports (Shallom and Shoham, 2003, Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 6, 219-228; Walker and Wilson, 1991. Bioresour. Technol. 36, 3-14). 
 β-1,4-mannanase is the endo-enzyme that degrades β-1,4-mannosidic binding in mannan polysaccharides randomly. Such glycoside hydrolase (GH) has the typical molecular structure composed of (β/α) 8 -barrel exhibiting double confront mechanism having anomer structure (Moreira and Filho, 2008, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 79, 165-178). β-1,4-mannanase in microorganism seems to be related to three GH family members, 5, 26, and 113, based on the amino acid sequence and structural/mechanical homology (cazy with the extension .org of the world wide web). Approximately 140 gene sequences of β-1,4-mannanase can be obtained from NCBI data-base. The homology among many genes encoding β-1,4-mannanase, which are originated from various bacteria and fungi, has been confirmed by genome analysis. Nevertheless, genetic and biochemical characteristics of β-1,4-mannanase originated from microorganism have not been disclosed as much as the characteristics of β-1,4-endoglucanases and β-1,4-xylanases. 
 Various aerobic and anaerobic cellulose decomposing microorganisms found in intestines of invertebrates and herbivores drew our attention recently as promising candidates capable of producing a novel GH enzyme having specific structural and functional characteristics (Brennan et al., 2004, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70, 3609-3617; Selinger et al., 1996, Anaerobe 2, 263-284). Even though it is presumed that an invertebrate such as earthworm that magnetizes soil organic matters has various cellulose decomposing microorganisms, most carbohydrolases have been confirmed to be the enzymes that degrade cellulose and xylan originated from rumen bacteria and insect intestine bacteria. 
 Two hemicellulose decomposing bacteria identified so far are  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 (Kim et al., 2009, Proc. Biochem. 44, 1055-1059; Kim et al., 2009, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 75, 7275-7279) and  Streptomyces thermocarboxydus  HY-15 (Kim et al., 2010, J. Mol. Catal. B: Enzym. 62, 32-39), which have been isolated from  Eisenia fetida  intestines. Extracellular endo-β-1,4-xylanase thereof was identified and molecularly confirmed. However, there have been no studies to disclose the characteristics of mannanase produced from the earthworm symbiotic microorganism at molecular level. 
 Thus, the present inventors identified the novel mannanase originated from  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13, the earthworm symbiotic bacterium, and further disclosed the structural and biochemical characteristics of the mannanase along with the optimum conditions for the specific activity. The present inventors thereby completed this invention by confirming that GH5 β-1,4-mannanase identified to have high specific activity toward ivory nut mannan and locust bean gum could be effectively used as a feed efficiency enhancer.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
 Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail. 
 The present invention provides a mannanase produced from  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 deposited under the Accession Number of KCTC 11302BP. 
 The said mannanase characteristically has the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 1, but not always limited thereto. 
 Molecular weight of the said mannanase is characteristically 43.0˜45.0 kDa, but not always limited thereto. 
 The said mannanase preferably shows the maximum activity at pH 5.0˜7.0, and more preferably shows the maximum activity at pH 6.0, but not always limited thereto. 
 The said mannanase preferably shows the maximum activity at 45˜55° C., and more preferably shows the maximum activity at 50° C., but not always limited thereto. 
 The said mannanase characteristically exhibits the stable enzyme activity in the presence of one of metal ions selected from the group consisting of Ca, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Sn, Ba, Co, and Fe, but not always limited thereto. 
 The said mannanase exhibits the increased enzyme activity in the presence of one of metal ions selected from the group consisting of Ca, Mn, and Ba, but not always limited thereto. 
 The said mannanase demonstrates the high activity toward such matrix as locust bean gum and ivory nut, but not always limited to those matrixes. 
 The said mannanase exhibits the endo-β-1,4-mannanase activity, but not always limited thereto. 
 In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the present inventors obtained the strain demonstrating mannanase activity, among earthworm enteric bacteria, cultured on LB agar medium containing Azo-mannan. Since the strain had at least 99.8% homology with  Cellulosimicrobium funkei  ATCC BAA-886, the strain of the present invention was identified as  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. strain and then named  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 (see  FIG. 1 ). The strain was deposited at Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, one of international depository authorities, in Mar. 12, 2008 (Accession No: KCTC 11302BP). 
 Chromosome DNA was extracted from  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13, which proceeded to PCR with the gene sequence common to GH5 endo-β-1,4-mannanase. Total mannanase gene sequence was obtained by cloning the PCR product into pGEM-T vector (Promega). The mannanase gene and other mannanase like enzyme analogues proceeded to multiple sequence alignment. As a result, the mannanase was confirmed to be very similar to extracellular GH5 endo-β-1,4-mannanase, suggesting that the mannanase has the molecular structure of endo-β-1,4-mannanase (see  FIG. 2 ). Sequence homology of mannanase catalytic GH5 domain and extracellular GH5 mannanase was very low. The mannanase exhibited highest homology with  Micromonospora  sp. β-1,4-mannosidase (GenBank Accession Number: GG657738), which was 65%, indicating that the mannanase of the present invention was the novel enzyme (see  FIG. 3 ). 
 Sequence confirmed mannanase gene was expressed and the enzyme was isolated and purified therefrom. To examine the molecular weight of the purified enzyme, SDS-PAGE was performed. As a result, it was confirmed that the mannanase protein was the enzyme having the molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa. 
 To investigate the characteristics of the mannanase, the optimum reaction temperature was examined at different temperatures of 37, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70° C. The optimum reaction pH was also examined at pH 4.0˜10.0. Particularly, the maximum degrading activity of the mannanase to the matrix was confirmed when the mannanase was reacted with locust bean gum at 50° C. at pH 6.0 (see  FIGS. 5 a  and 5 b   ). Half life of the enzyme was confirmed as 15 minutes at the optimum temperature (50° C.), which would be the thermolabile index of the mannanase. Thermolability of the mannanase was rapidly increased when the mannanase was exposed on the temperature of 55° C. 
 To investigate the effect of metal ions and chemicals on mannanase activity, metal ions (1 mM) and chemicals (5 mM) were treated to mannanase in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 50° C. for 10 minutes, followed by investigation of mannanase activity. As a result, catalytic activity of the mannanase was approximately at least 1.4 fold increased in the presence of Ca 2+ . In the meantime, the mannanase activity was approximately 1.2 fold increased in the presence of divalent cations such as Mn 2+  and Ba 2+  (see Table 1). 
 Therefore, the novel enzyme produced from  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 can be effectively used as a mannanase. 
 The present invention also provides a polynucleotide encoding the said mannanase. 
 The said polynucleotide is preferably encoding the sequence represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 2, but not always limited thereto. 
 The present invention further provides a vector containing the said polynucleotide. 
 The present invention also provides a transformant constructed by transforming the host cell with the said vector. 
 In this invention, the novel mannanase originated from  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13, the earthworm symbiotic bacterium, was identified. The structural and biochemical characteristics of the mannanase were confirmed along with the optimum conditions for the specific activity. Particularly, the mannanase was identified as GH5 β-1,4-mannanase exhibiting the high specific activity toward ivory nut mannan and locust bean gum. Therefore, the polynucleotide encoding the said mannanase, the vector comprising the same, and the transformant of the vector can be effectively used. 
 The present invention also provides a method for producing a mannanase comprising the following steps: 
 1) culturing  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13 deposited under the Accession Number of KCTC 11302BP in the medium containing mannan, and obtaining supernatant by centrifuging thereof; 
 2) inducing precipitation of water-soluble proteins by adding a precipitant to the supernatant of step 1); 
 3) obtaining a crude enzyme solution by dialyzing the precipitate of step 2) after eliminating insoluble precipitate from the same; and 
 4) purifying mannanase from the crude enzyme solution of step 3). 
 The precipitant of step 2) is preferably selected from the group consisting of ammonium sulfate, acetone, isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, and polyethyleneglycol, but not always limited thereto. 
 In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, centrifugation was performed to isolate cells from the culture solution. The isolated cells were treated with a protein separation solution (Novagen), which proceeded to centrifugation to obtain a crude enzyme solution. The crude enzyme solution obtained via centrifugation was loaded on HisTrap HP affinity column chromatography, leading to enzyme elution. The eluted fraction was loaded on HiPrep 26/10 desalting column to eliminate salts. The desalted fraction was loaded on Hiload 26/60  Superdex  200 equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). For further purification, the obtained active fraction was loaded on Hiprep 16/10 DEAE FF anion-exchange column chromatography. As a result, the mannanase purified under the conditions of 1.0 M NaCl and 2.0 Ml/min was obtained. 
 The mannanase obtained by the above production method was identified as GH-5 β-1,4-mannanase demonstrating high substrate specificity to mannan. Therefore, the said method can be effectively used for the production of the novel mannanase from  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13. 
 The present invention also provides a feed additive containing the said mannanase as an active ingredient. 
 The feed additive herein is added to non-ruminant feed, but not always limited thereto. 
 The present invention also provides a plant feed containing the said feed additive as an active ingredient. 
 The present invention also provides a use of the said mannanase, the said transformant, or the said mannanase produced by the said method for the preparation of a feed additive. 
 In addition, the present invention also provides a use of the said feed additive for the preparation of a plant feed. 
 In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, mannanase activity against various matrixes was compared. Particularly, locust bean gum, ivory nut mannan, and guar gum were used as different matrixes to compare the enzyme activity of the purified mannanase. As a result, the mannanase of the present invention was confirmed to be the enzyme having high activity of 14,711 IU/mg to ivory nut mannan. The enzyme activity to locust bean gum and guar gum of the said mannanase of the present invention was respectively 8,498 IU/mg and 967 IU/mg. Carbohydrates such as carboxymethylcellulose, Birchwood xylan, soluble starch, and pectin were not degraded by the mannanase. Therefore, it was presumed that the mannanase was the strict GH5 β-1,4-mannanase lacking of glycoside hydrolase activity. The mannanase of the present invention was therefore confirmed to be able to degrade mannan efficiently and specifically and further to be efficiently used for animal feed considering that most of recent plant feeds for animal contain a high concentration of mannan. As explained hereinbefore, the mannanase of the present invention is suitable as a feed additive designed to be enhance mannan degrading activity in plant feed, suggesting that the mannanase of the invention can be effectively used as a feed additive for mannan glycation. 
 When the feed additive of the present invention is added to those feeds for non-ruminant such as pig and chicken which exhibit low efficiency in using starch or protein in grain cell wall because the feeds do not include the enzyme degrading plant cell wall, the additive can glycosylate mannan, the major component of cell wall, to bring the effect of increasing feed value. 
 As an active ingredient, the mannanase of the present invention is added to feed preferably at the concentration of 0.01˜10 weight part and more preferably at the concentration of 0.05˜5 weight part, and most preferably at the concentration of 0.12 weight part. 
 The said feed additive herein can additionally include any acceptable carrier for non-ruminant. In this invention, the feed additive can be used as it is or include any generally informed carrier or stabilizer. If necessary, nutrients such as vitamins, amino acids, and minerals, or antioxidants and other additives can be added to the feed additive of the present invention. The feed additive can be formulated in the forms of powder, granule, pellet, and suspension. For the administration, the feed additive of the present invention can be provided to non-ruminant singly or as mixed in feed. 
 The present inventors identified the novel mannanase produced from  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13, the earthworm symbiotic bacterium. The structural and biochemical characteristics of the mannanase were confirmed along with the optimum conditions for the specific activity. Particularly, the mannanase was identified as GH5 β-1,4-mannanase exhibiting the high specific activity toward ivory nut mannan and locust bean gum. Therefore, the present invention can provide a feed additive containing the said mannanase as an active ingredient for mannan glycation. The mannanase of the present invention can also be added to feed for non-ruminant or plant feed as an active ingredient to increase mannan glycation. 
 Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrative as shown in the following Examples, Experimental Examples and Manufacturing Examples. 
 However, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, on consideration of this disclosure, may make modifications and improvements within the spirit and scope of the present invention. 
 Example 1 
 Identification of  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 
 Among earthworm enterobacteria, microflora of the strain showing mannanase activity was obtained on LB agar medium containing Azo-mannan. Characteristics of the strain producing the mannanase showing the highest activity was analyzed. To identify the separated strain, 16s rDNA sequencing was performed. As a result, the strain was confirmed to have at least 99.8% homology with  Cellulosimicrobium funkei  ATCC BAA-886, so that the strain was identified as  Celluosimicrobium  sp. and named  Celluosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 ( FIG. 1 ). The  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13 demonstrating the highest mannanase activity separated above was stored in a freezer and deposited at Korean Collection for Type Cultures, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (Accession No: KCTC 11302BP). 
 Example 2 
 Obtaining Mannanase Gene from  Celluosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 
 <2-1> Separation of Mannanase Gene 
 Chromosome DNA was extracted from  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13. Based on the common gene sequences with GH5 endo-β-1,4-mannanase (VDAPNW; SEQ. ID. NO: 3, and GWSWSGN; SEQ. ID. NO: 4), a forward primer (5′-GTCGACGCSCCGAACTGG-3′; SEQ. ID. NO: 5) and a reverse primer (5′-GTTGCCCGACCACGACCAGC-3′; SEQ. ID. NO: 6) were designed as DNA primers for PCR. 50 μl of PCR mixture was prepared with the primers, 2.5 unit polymerase (FastStart Tag DNA polymerase), 2.5 mM of each dNTP, 20 pmol primer, 50 ng of DNA, and buffer. PCR was performed as follows; predenaturation at 95° C. for 5 minutes, denaturation at 95° C. for 30 seconds, annealing at 59° C. for 30 seconds, extension at 72° C. for 3  minutes  35 cycles from denaturation to extension, and final extension at 72° C. for 30 seconds. The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega), from which total mannanase gene sequence was obtained ( FIG. 2 ). 
 <2-2> Characteristics of Mannanase Gene 
 Multiple sequence alignment was performed with the said mannanase gene and other similar enzyme sequences. As a result, the said mannanase was confirmed to be very similar to extracellular GH5 endo-β-1,4-mannanase, suggesting that the said mannanase had the molecular structure similar to that of the endo-β-1,4-mannanase ( FIG. 2 ). The said mannanase was also confirmed to be the multi-domain protein having a GH5 catalytic domain and two CBM like domains on C-terminal. 
 Sequence homology was compared between catalytic GH5 domain of the mannanase and extracellular GH5 mannanase, and as a result, the sequence homology was comparatively low. The highest sequence homology was confirmed between the said domain and  Micromonospora  sp. β-1,4-mannosidase (GenBank Accession Number: GG657738), which was 65%. The homology between the mannanase and  Streptomyces  sp. s6-204 β-1,4-mannanase (ABY90130) and the homology between the mannanase and  S. coelicolor  A3 β-1,4-mannosidase (CAA20610) were also 62%. S. The sequence homology between the mannanase and  S. lividans  TK24 β-1,4-mannanase (EFD65759) was 61%. Therefore, the mannanase of the present invention was confirmed to be the novel enzyme ( FIG. 3 ). 
 Example 3 
 Expression, Purification, and Analysis of Mannanase 
 <3-1> Expression and Purification of Mannanase 
 To express the mannanase gene whose gene sequence was already identified and to separate and purify the enzyme, the expression vector pET-28a(+) was digested with NdeI/HindIII. The pGEM-T vector containing the recombinated mannanase gene of Example 2 proceeded to PCR using DNA primers containing NdeI/HindIII restriction enzyme sites respectively in N-terminal and C-terminal. As a result, DNA fragment was obtained.  E. coli  BL21 was transformed with the pGEM-T(+) expression vector containing the recombinated mannanase gene. From the transformant, colonies were obtained. Particularly, the transformed strain was cultured in 2 l baffled-flask containing 500 Ml of Luria-Bertani medium at 30° C. at 180 rpm for 7 hours. To induce over-expression of the mannanase, 1 mM of IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside) was added to the medium. When absorbance (A600) of the culture solution reached 0.4˜0.5, the medium was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the precipitate (cells) was stored at −20° C. for 1 hour. The separated cells were treated with BugBuster protein isolation solution (Novagen), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 minutes to obtain a crude enzyme solution. The obtained crude enzyme solution proceeded to HisTrap HP affinity column chromatography and the recombinated enzyme was eluted by the manufacturer's protocol. Salt was eliminated from the obtained active fraction by loading the fraction on HiPrep 26/10 desalting column in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The desalted fraction was loaded on Hiload 26/60  Superdex  200 equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). For further purification, the obtained active fraction was loaded on Hiprep 16/10 DEAF FF anion-exchange column chromatography. As a result, a mannanase purified under the conditions of 1.0 M NaCl and 2.0 Ml/min was obtained. 
 <3-2> Analysis of Mannanase 
 SDS-PAGE (sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was performed on 12.0% gel, followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Then, zymography analysis was performed with the recombinated protein purified by affinity chromatography on 12.0% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5% locust bean gum. After SDS-PAGE, bio-degradation was induced for 15 minutes at 50° C. Upon completion of the reaction, β-1,4-mannanase activity was investigated by Congo red staining. 
 As a result, the mannanase was confirmed to be the enzyme having the molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa. Compared with the β-1,4-mannanase reported previously, the recombinated mannanase of the present invention had the molecular weight most similar to that of  Aspergillus aculeatus  endo-β-1,4-mannanase. The molecular weight of the recombinated mannanase was bigger than those of  Cellulosimicrobium  sp. HY-13 Mank (35.0 kDa) and  S. lividans  66 β-mannanase (36.0 kDa) ( FIG. 4 ). However, the molecular weight of the said mannanase was smaller than that of non-multifunctional GH-5 (β-mannanase (>60.0 kDa) known to have relative high molecular weight ( FIG. 4 ). 
 Example 4 
 Characteristics of Mannanase 
 <4-1> Optimum Temperature, pH, and Chemical Properties of Mannanase 
 To determine the optimum reaction temperature of the mannanase, mannanase activity was measured at different temperatures of 37, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70° C. To measure thermo-stability, the mannanase was heat-treated at the said temperatures for 15, 30, and 60 minutes and then the remained activity was measured. To determine the optimum reaction pH, the mannanase was treated respectively with 50 mM of sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.0˜5.5), phosphate buffer (pH 5.5˜7.5), Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5˜9.0), and glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0˜10.0) in pH range of 4.0˜10.0 at 55° C. for 15 minutes, followed by measurement of enzyme reaction. 
 As a result, the maximum degrading activity of the mannanase to the matrix was confirmed when the mannanase was reacted with locust bean gum at 50° C. at pH 6.0 ( FIGS. 5 a  and 5 b   ). Half life of the enzyme was confirmed as 15 minutes at the optimum temperature (50° C.), which would be the thermolabile index of the mannanase. Thermolability of the mannanase was rapidly increased when the mannanase was exposed on the temperature of 55° C. ( FIG. 5 c   ). 
 <4-2> Effect of Metal Ions and Chemicals on Mannanase Activity 
 To investigate the effect of metal ions and chemicals on mannanase activity, metal ions (1 mM) and chemicals (5 mM) were treated to mannanase in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 50° C. for 10 minutes, followed by investigation of mannanase activity. 
 As a result, catalytic activity of the mannanase was approximately at least 1.4 fold increased in the presence of Ca 2+ . In the meantime, the mannanase activity was approximately 1.2 fold increased in the presence of divalent cations such as Mn 2+  and Ba 2+ . However, Mg 2+  or Sn 2+  had no effect on the enzyme activity. In the meantime, the powerful Trp regulators such as Hg 2+  and N-bromosuccinimide inactivated the mannanase, and such metal ions as Cu 2+ , Zn 2+  and Fe 2+  inhibited the enzyme activity significantly at least 50% (Table 1).

 Substrate Specificity of Mannanase 
 To compare the mannanase activity to different matrixes, locust bean gum, ivory nut mannan and guar gum were used as matrixes and the activity of the purified mannanase to those matrixes were investigated. 
 The activity of β-1,4-mannanase was investigated by measuring the reduced amount of glucose isolated from locust bean gum using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). At this time, D-mannose was used as a standard material. 0.5 Ml of a standard mixture composed of 0.5% locust bean gum was mixed with 0.05 Ml of an enzyme aqueous solution, followed by inducing biodegradation reaction in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 50° C. for 15 minutes. The activity of the recombinated mannanase (1 IU) to the mannan substrate was defined as the amount of the protein necessary for the secretion of 1 μmol reducing sugar under the standard analysis condition. Chromogenic PNP-sugar derivative was used to measure another degrading activity of the said recombinated enzyme. The enzyme activity of the recombinated mannanase to the chromogenic substrate was measured under the same conditions as set for the analysis of β-1,4-mannanase activity. The activity of the recombinated mannanase (1 IU) to the PNP-sugar derivative was defined as the amount of the protein necessary for the production of 1 μmol PNP under the standard analysis condition. 
 As a result, the mannanase of the present invention was confirmed to be the enzyme having high activity of 14,711 IU/mg to ivory nut mannan. The enzyme activity to locust bean gum and guar gum of the said mannanase of the present invention was respectively 8,498 IU/mg and 967 IU/mg. The above results indicate that the specific activity of the mannanase to ivory nut mannan was 1.7 fold and 15.2 fold higher that the activity to locust bean gum and guar gum (Table 2 and Table 3). In the meantime, carbohydrates such as carboxymethylcellulose, Birchwood xylan, soluble starch, and pectin were not degraded by the mannanase. Therefore, it was confirmed that the mannanase was the strict GH5 β-1,4-mannanase lacking of glycoside hydrolase activity (Table 3).

 Analysis of Degradation Product 
 Mannooligomer (M 2 ˜M 5 , 1 mg/100 μl each) and locust bean gum (1.4 mg/100 μl) were reacted in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1 μg of the recombinant mannanase at 30° C. for 12 hours, followed by investigation of the hydrolysate. HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) was performed by using Finnigan Surveyor™ Modular HPLC systems (Thermo Electron Co.) equipped with Asahipak NH2P-50 2D column (5 μm, 2.0×150 mm, Shodex) ran by Xcalibur software (version 1.3 SP2, Thermo Electron Co.). Elution buffer A (0.05% pomalus acid/sterilized water) and elution buffer B (acetonitrile and methanol (7:3) containing 0.05% pomalus acid) were used as moving phases. LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry) was performed by using Finnigan LCQ Advantage MAX ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Co.). 
 The mannan hydrolysate produced by the mannanase was investigated by HPLC analysis. As a result, mannan polysaccharide of locust bean gum was primarily degraded into M 5  (44.2%) along with mannooligomer (at least M 6 , 39.4%). And small amount of M 1  (1.1%), M 2  (6.4%), M 3  (1.5%), and M 4  (7.4%) were generated as hydrolysates. In the meantime, ivory nut mannan was mostly degraded into M 4  (25.2%). Later on, most of M 3 ˜M 5  were further degraded into M 2 . N 2 , as a substrate, was not degraded by the mannanase anymore (Table 4). The above results indicate that the mannanase is the only endo-β-1,4-mannanase able to degrade β-1,4-mannos bond in the major backbone of a mannos material.

 Binding Activity of Mannanase to Hydrophobic Polymer 
 The mannanase of the present invention contains two  family  10 CBMs at C-terminal, which plays an important role in enzyme-substrate interaction. As the mannanase was expected to bind to various carbohydrate polymers, hydrophobic materials having microstructures including polysaccharide, poly(3HB) granules, and lignin were used as substrates to investigate enzyme-substrate binding activity of the mannanase. 
 Before analyzing the binding activity, insoluble substrates were washed with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) 5 times, followed by measuring the binding capacity of the enzyme to the hydrophobic materials. Particularly, the enzyme diluted at the concentration of 5.0 IU/Ml was put on ice for two hours with the equal volume of a substrate polymer. The mixture was stirred every 5 minute. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000×g to obtain supernatant. Then, the activity of β-1,4-mannanase thereof was measured. 
 As a result, the mannanase was strongly conjugated to Avicel, chitosan, chitin, and insoluble ivory nut mannan, but was not conjugated to insoluble oat spelt xylan, lignin, curdlan, and poly(3HB) granules ( FIG. 6 ). Therefore, it was confirmed that the mannanase of the present invention was the novel modular β-1,4-mannanase having affinity to various insoluble polymers.
