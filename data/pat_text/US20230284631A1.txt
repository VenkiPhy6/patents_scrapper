   FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE 
   
    
    [0003]
     The invention relates to treatment of a plant with one or more microorganisms for inhibiting a plant pathogen. More particularly, the invention relates to isolated  Bacillus  strains, and strains having all of the identifying characteristics of these strains, and combinations thereof, for a use comprising the above-mentioned use. 
   BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   
    
    [0004]
     The present invention relates to microorganisms, such as isolated  Bacillus  strains for use in inhibiting plant pathogens. Fungal pathogens cause a variety of diseases in plants, including, but not limited to, basal stem rot disease caused by  Ganoderma boninense , bud rot caused by  Phytophthora palmivora , and wilt caused by  Fusarium oxysporum . These diseases detrimentally affect palm plants on oil palm plantations, and cause significant economic losses in the palm oil industry. An additional fungal species,  Cladosporium  cladosporioides causes  Cladosporium  rot in the leaves and fruit of many plants, most notably red wine grapevines.  C. cladosporioides  affects up to 50% of grape clusters at harvest, greatly reducing yield and detrimentally impacting wine quality. Yeasts such as  Pichia manshurica , which grow on the fruit surface can contribute to off-odors and wine spoilage also resulting in loss of wine quality and financial loss.  Aspergillus fumigatus  is a ubiquitous mold that is commonly found on decaying vegetation and is not only a problem as an agent of soft rot, but has also been established as the global leading cause of aspergillosis in humans and causes one of the highest numbers of deaths among patients with fungal infections. Many other fungal diseases have detrimental effects on plants and cause significant economic losses in the horticulture, agricultural, and forestry industries in general, for example.  Ralstonia solanacearum  is a soil-borne bacterial strain that causes bacterial wilt in a wide range of host plants.

   Example 1 
 Culture Conditions 
   
    
    [0162]
     All fungal cultures were obtained from ATCC and include  Ganoderma boninense  ATCC 204074,  Ganoderma weberianum  ATCC 76753,  Ganoderma mirabile  ATCC 76757, 76537,  Phytophthora palmivora  ATCC 26008,  Phytophthora palmivora  ATCC 52161,  Fusarium oxysporum  ATCC 36870,  Fusarium kyushuense  ATCC 56750, and  Fusarium nelsonii  201410.  Ganoderma  species were cultured on yeast mold agar,  Phytophthora  species were cultured on tomato juice agar, and  Fusarium  species were cultured on potato dextrose agar.  Bacillus  strains 86, 300, 101, 235, 77, 177, 102, A12, ATC2, V17, V18, or 1607 were cultured on tryptic soy agar. 
   Example 2 
 Antifungal Plate Assay 
   
    
    [0163]
     Plates were inoculated with an agar plug of fungal growth placed in the center of the plate.  Bacillus  culture was struck on the plate in two parallel lines on either side of the agar plug at a distance of 3 cm. The plates were incubated at 30° C. until the fungal culture exceeded 6 cm in diameter. Data was recorded at 6 days for all strains except  F. kyushuense , which was recorded at 12 days. Fungal growth was measured, and inhibition scores were assigned for each  Bacillus  strain. Scores of −, +, ++, or +++ were defined as no inhibition, inhibition of 1 cm fungal growth, inhibition of 2 cm, and inhibition of 3 cm, respectively. 
     
    
    [0164]
     Several  Bacillus  strains had strong antifungal activity against all six fungal strains (see Table 1 below). The top six strains had at least moderate activity against all fungal strains, and were further evaluated for antifungal activity in a broth assay.

 Antifungal Broth Assay 
   
    
    [0165]
     The top performing  Bacillus  strains in the plate assay were evaluated using a broth method. An agar plug of fungal growth was used to inoculate 20 ml of broth media containing 10% cell-free  Bacillus  supernatant. Supernatants were prepared by growing  Bacillus  in tryptic soy broth for 24 hours, centrifuging the culture for 20 minutes at 4000 rpm, and filter-sterilizing the supernatant with a 0.22 μm filter. Fungal cultures were grown at 30° C. for two weeks. Fungal growth was filtered and allowed to dry completely. Total dry fungal weight was recorded, and inhibition was reported as a percentage of the reduction in growth weight compared to controls.  G. mirabile  and  P. palmivora  strains were excluded from the broth assay as they did not grow well in broth media. 
     
    
    [0166]
       F. nelsonii  and  F. kyushuense  were not inhibited at all by any  Bacillus  species (data not shown). However, all six  Bacillus  strains inhibited  G. boninense  by over 40%, the pathogen responsible for causing basal stem rot in oil palm plants (see  FIG.  1   —strain “A1gT2” in  FIG.  1    is the same as strain ATC2).        Bacillus              strain      235, 300, and 1607 also had strong activity against  G. weberianum. Bacillus  strains 101 and 300 had the best activity against  F. oxysporum.    
   Example 4 
 Isolation and Identification of Additional Pathogenic or Spoilage Fungi 
   
    
    [0167]
     Additional fungal isolates were obtained from molding or rotting vegetation including spoiled corn and hay silage, and were isolated by dilution plating on acidified potato dextrose agar incubated at room temperature (19-21° C.), protected from light, for 2-5 days until distinct isolate growth was observed. DNA was extracted from fungal isolates using the Nucleospin Microbial DNA extraction kit (Machery-Nagel, Duren, Germany), employing a bead-beating step for cell lysis. The fungal ribosomal intergenic spacer (ITS) region was amplified using primers ITS1 (TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG; SEQ ID NO: 1) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC; SEQ ID NO: 2) (White, et al., Amplification and direct sequencing of fungal ribosomal RNA genes for phylogenetics, pp. 315-322, In: PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications, eds. Innis, et al., Academic Press, Inc., New York (1990), incorporated herein by reference for the amplification method described in this example), following recommended amplification parameters. Product size was determined by gel electrophoresis, the PCR product was cleaned up with the Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit (Hilden, Germany), and DNA sequencing of each purified PCR product was performed by Eurofins Genomics (Louisville, Ky.). Sequences were trimmed for quality, in Chromas 2.6 (Technelysium, South Brisbane, Australia) and identified to the closest species match using a nucleotide BLAST search (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Md.). 
   Example 5 
 Antifungal Cross-Streak Assay Using Plant and Spoilage Fungi 
   
    
    [0168]
     Strain-specific antifungal activities of  Bacillus  strains were tested using agar cross-streak antimicrobial susceptibility methods known in the art and described below. Briefly,  Bacillus  strains 77, 86, 300, 101, 235, and V18 were inoculated from frozen glycerol stocks in a single 1 cm wide vertical streak down the center of a non-acidified potato dextrose agar plate. Plates were incubated aerobically for 24 hours at 37° C., or until a confluent streak of  Bacillus  growth was present. Isolates of  Cladosporium, Pichia  and  A. fumigatus  were struck horizontally from the center of the plate, beginning the streak within 1 mm of the  Bacillus  growth and streaking out to the plate perimeter. Plates were incubated at 25° C. under aerobic conditions for 3 days for  Pichia  yeasts and 5 days for the remaining fungal isolates. Zones of inhibition were measured where fungal isolate growth was inhibited by the  Bacillus  strain. Table 2 shows antimicrobial screening utilizing the agar cross streak method against isolates of  Cladosporium  cladosporioides,  Pichia manshurica, Pichia  kudriavzevii and  Aspergillus fumigatus . Scores of −, +, ++, or +++ were defined as no inhibition, inhibition of 2-5 mm fungal growth, inhibition of 5-10 mm, and inhibition of >10 mm, respectively. 
     
    
    [0169]
     Several  Bacillus  strains had broad antifungal activity against all fungal strains tested (see Table 2 below). The top performing  Bacillus  strain was further evaluated for antifungal activity in a broth assay.

   Aspergillus Fumigatus  Antifungal Broth Assay 
   
    
    [0170]
     The top performing  Bacillus  strain in the plate assay ( Bacillus  strain 300) was evaluated using a broth method to determine efficacy of inhibition of  A. fumigatus  in a liquid matrix. The supernatant was prepared by growing    Bacillus      strain  300 in tryptic soy broth for 24 hours at 32° C., centrifuging the culture for 20 minutes at 4000 rpm, and filter-sterilizing the supernatant with a 0.22 μm filter.  Aspergillus fumigatus  was propagated in potato dextrose broth to produce a suspension of approximately 105 spores/ml. A 0.1 ml amount of this inoculum was used to inoculate 5 ml of potato dextrose broth mixed with 1 ml of sterile-filtered supernatant from    Bacillus      strain  300 or with 1 ml of sterile culture broth (Control). Nine replicates of each treatment were prepared and all replicates were incubated for 24 hr at 37° C. Replicates were pooled into triplicate samples, fungal biomass was sedimented via centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes, washed with sterile water to remove media residue, dried on sterile filters and weighed to determine fungal biomass. The photograph shown in  FIG.  2 B  was taken at the end of the 24 hour growth period and the tubes are from left to right, control and    Bacillus      strain  300 treatment. Total dry fungal weight was recorded, and inhibition was reported as a percentage of the reduction in growth weight compared to controls.    Bacillus      strain  300 significantly inhibited  A. fumigatus  biomass (p=0.02), the species associated with acceleration of soft rot in many plant species and which is responsible for opportunistic infections in humans (see  FIG.  2 A ). 
   Example 7 
 Inhibition of  Ralstonia Solanacearum  by  Bacillus  Strains 
   
    
    [0171]
       Ralstonia solanacearum  is a soilborne pathogen that causes bacterial wilt in a variety of crops. Strains of  Ralstonia  were isolated from soil and tested for inhibition of the isolated  Ralstonia  strains by  Bacillus  species. Soil samples were plated for  Ralstonia  species on semi-selective media. Modified SMSA medium contained 1 g/L casein, 10 g/L peptone, 5 ml/L glycerol, and 17 g/L agar at pH 7.0 (Elphinstone et al., 1996). After autoclaving, media was supplemented with 5 mg/L crystal violet, 100 mg/L polymyxin B sulfate, 25 mg/L bacitracin, 5 mg/L chloromycetin, 0.5 mg/L penicillin, and 100 mg/L cycloheximide. Presumptive  Ralstonia  isolates were identified as  Ralstonia  species by 16S sequencing.  Bacillus  species were tested for antimicrobial activity against the  Ralstonia  species using a cross streak method. The zone of inhibition between the  Bacillus  and  Ralstonia  streak was measured in mm. 
     
    
    [0172]
     As shown in Table 3 below, all  Bacillus  species tested showed some inhibition of all three  Ralstonia  isolates.  Bacillus  species have the potential to be used as biocontrol agents against  Ralstonia  species.
