    [0001]
     The present invention relates to novel uricase mutants and their use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to uricase mutants, their production and their recombinant peptide sequences and corresponding recombinant nucleotide sequence. 
   
 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 
 
   
    
    [0002]
     Hyperuricemia is the condition in which the concentration of uric acid in the serum is above the normal range of uric acid levels (2.4 - 6.0 mg/dl for females and 3.4 - 7.0 mg/dl for males)(Chizynski and Rozycka 2005). Even though the cause and effect relationship has not been established (Alderman 2007) for some of the diseases, hyperuricemia is believed to be associated with metabolic syndrome (Choi and Ford 2007) and all the individual components of metabolic syndrome (Choi, Mount et al. 2005; Puig and Martinez 2008; Fraile, Torres et al. 2010)). Causes of hyperuricemia can be due to some disorder in purine degradation pathway or can be due to another disease or some conditions resulting in increased levels of uric acid, like chemotherapy for cancer or kidney diseases. In most of the cases hyperuricemia condition is asymptomatic. Increase in levels of uric acid occur due to over activity of uric acid synthesizing enzymes or defect in uric acid excretion mechanism or both (Yamamoto 2008). Intake of high purine content food (Brule, Sarwar et al. 1992) or the disorders in enzymes of purine degradation pathway like HGPRT, PRPP synthetase, xanthine oxidase increases the levels of uric acid. The excretion of uric acid can be impaired by some antiuricosuric drugs like  pyrazinamide , ethambutol, cyclosporine (Scott 1991) or by the improper function of uric acid transporters in kidney. In most of the mixed cases, it is both increase in production of uric acid and decrease in excretion of uric acid through kidney. 
     
    
    [0003]
     Hyperuricemia condition leads to gout and also has number of other significant associations (Feig, Kang et al. 2008). Hyperuricemia is also a risk factor for myocardial infarction and renal diseases (Bos, Koudstaal et al. 2006; Chang, Tung et al. 2010)). It was observed in animals, along with the epidemiological evidence from humans that hyperuricemia was a significant contributor for cardiovascular and vascular diseases (Feig, Kang et al. 2008). Hyperuricemia also plays role in the development of metabolic diseases (Vuorinen-Markkola and Yki-Jarvinen 1994; Cigolini, Targher et al. 1995; Lehto, Niskanen et al. 1998; Fang and Alderman 2000). 
     
    
    [0004]
     Another condition resulted due high urate levels is hyperuricosuria in which the urate crystals are formed in the kidney. The enhanced levels of uric acid in the urine and the defect in its excretion results in the formation of uric acid crystals. This condition may be acute, a complication of tumor lysis syndrome or may be chronic, associated to gout. 
     
    
    [0005]
     Gout is a common metabolic disorder in humans which is characterized by chronic hyperuricemia, deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints and an acute inflammatory arthritis (Choi, Mount et al. 2005). Gout manifests as microscopic and macroscopic deposits of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals tophi which trigger intense acute arthritis with excruciating pain and periarticular inflammation (Mandell 2008). Chronic hyperuricemia in which the serum uric acid levels rises above 9 mg/dl is the most important risk factor for the development of gout. However, only minority of people with hyperuricemia will develop gout (Campion, Glynn et al. 1987; Emmerson 1996; Wortmann 2002). In acute gout, monosodium urate crystals liberated from tissue deposits promote an inflammatory cascade and release of multiple inflammatory cytokines which culminates in neutrophilic inflammation (Liu-Bryan, Scott et al. 2005; Cronstein and Terkeltaub 2006; Martinon, Petrilli et al. 2006). 
     
    
    [0006]
     Humans have uniquely high basal levels of serum uric acid because of missense mutations resulting in a non-functional uricase gene (Yeldandi, Wang et al. 1990; Wu, Muzny et al. 1992). Gout has also been recognized as a complication of cyclosporine therapy among the recipients involved in organ transplantation (Burack, Griffith et al. 1992; Baethge, Work et al. 1993; Ben Hmida, Hachicha et al. 1995). There has been no major change in the treatment of gout since the introduction of colchicum in the sixteenth century" (Hench, Bauer et al. 1935). Treatment has to be done for the acute attack, lowering urate level and lastly prophylaxis to prevent acute gouty attacks. Antihyperuricemic agents are of different types, like xanthine oxidase inhibitors that target uric acid production, uricosurics that enhance the renal uric acid excretion and uricases, the enzymes that degrade uric acid (Bieber and Terkeltaub 2004). 
     
    
    [0007]
     Uric acid is oxidized by uricase to allantoin, which is five times more soluble than uric acid and undergoes efficient renal elimination. Uricase therapies for the gout management could enable to resolute tophi after weeks to months of uricase therapy (Baraf, Matsumoto et al. 2008). Rasburicase, Pegloticase, Uricase-PEG20 are some of the uricase drugs for the treatment of gout. The drugs were effective but their production was difficult, half-life was short and severe allergic reactions were common (Pui, Relling et al. 1997). It was found that uricase administration may cause anaphylaxis, hemolysis and methemoglobinemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Later it was found that pegylation reduced serum uric acid levels, was well tolerated and no antibodies were detected (Bomalaski and Clark 2004). 
     
    
    [0008]
     In the process to obtain uricases having better catalytic efficiency, the mutants were created. The present invention is related to two mutant uricases having better catalytic efficiency compared to that of the wild type uricase enzyme.

     The Uricases from  Aspergillus flavus  [pH 8.0, (Li, Chen et al. 2006)], chimeric pig-baboon uricase (pH 9.2,    US8293228   ) are being used as drugs and uricase of  Candida utilis  (pH 8.5,    EP 2271750   ) is under phase III clinical trials. These enzymes retain only partial activity at biological pH when used as therapeutic agents as their optimum pH is around 8 to 8.5. The optimum pH of uricase of the present invention has been found to be close to the biological pH. This property is of significance since it has been found that the enzyme activity is retained almost in its entirety (close to 100%) when administered as drug. Some other uricases reported in the literature were shown to have optimum pH of 7.0 (Suzuki, Sakasegawa et al. 2004). However the stability of enzyme is in the pH range of 8.5 to 11 indicating that this enzyme will have low activity at biological pH. The uricase of  Candida utilis  was reported to have better catalytic efficiency than other uricases reported so far. However, the catalytic efficiency of uricase mutant strains of this patent invention has been found to be higher than that of the uricase of  Candida utilis  (2 to 3 fold higher) when examined under similar experimental conditions in our laboratory along with the other enzymes available in the market (the values are not reported in any literature)  (Table 1).   
     
    
    [0037]
     K M  (Michelis and Menten constant) indicates the affinity of the enzyme towards the substrate molecules. Affinity is inversely proportional to the K M  value, i.e. lower K M  value indicates better affinity of the enzyme towards the substrate. Kcat represents catalytic turnover number of the enzyme, i.e. number of substrate molecules converted per unit time, which is expressed as k cat  (min -1 ) in the above table. Higher Kcat value indicates the enhanced ability of the enzyme to convert the substrate molecules. The overall catalytic efficiency of the enzymes is expressed as k cat /K M  (µM -1  min -1

       Recombinant DNA methods:  In general, the methods and techniques of rDNA well known in the area of molecular biology were utilized. These are readily available from standard texts and protocol pertaining field of the art, for example,  Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual" (IIIrd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, 2001 ;  McPherson, M. J., Quirk P., and Taylor, G. R., [Ed.] PCR: A Practical Approach. IRL press, oxford., 1991 ). However, pertinent in the context of experiments describing the present invention, particularly where modifications were introduced to established procedures, are indicated in the examples wherever relevant.

       SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins:  SDS-PAGE is carried out, essentially according to  Laemmli, U.K., 1970, Nature 227:680  with minor modifications, as needed. Briefly, protein samples are prepared by mixing with an equal volume of the 2X sample buffer (0.1 M TrisCl, pH 6.8; 6 % SDS; 30 % glycerol; 15 % beta-mercaptoethanol and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue dye). Prior to loading onto the gel, the samples are heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The discontinuous gel system usually has 5 % (acrylamide conc.) in the stacking and 12 % in the resolving gel. Electrophoresis is carried out using Laemmli buffer at a constant current of 15 mA first, till the samples enter the gel and then 30 mA till the completion. On completion of electrophoresis, gel is immersed in 0.1% coomasie Blue R250 in methanol: acetic acid: water (4:1:5) with gentle shaking and is then destained in destaining solution (20 % methanol and 10 % glacial acetic acid) till the background becomes clear.

       Enzymatic assay of uricase:  Substrate mixture contains
       a. 2.2 ml of 2 mM Uric acid   b. 0.15 ml of 60 mM 4-Aminoantipyrine (4-AAP)   c. 0.15 ml of 1.5% Phenol   d. 0.15 ml of 20 U/ml Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)   e. 0.1 M respective buffer to make up to 3 ml
   a. Uricase added to the above mixture and incubated at 25°C for 20 min. The colour is measured at 505 nm (Chen, Wang et al. 2008).   b. The reaction mix was set for 300 µl rather than 3 ml for convenient measuring in BiotekPowerwave X Elisa plate reader. The amounts of the solutions added in the assay mix were calculated accordingly for 300 µl.

 Example 3: Preparation of recombinant plasmid with mutant uricases SEQ ID No. 5 & SEQ ID No.6 
 
   
    
    [0067]
     The restriction sites of  Nco I and  Xho I were inserted in the forward and reverse primers respectively (Restriction sites of  Nco I and  Xho I were inserted in primers with SEQ ID no. 7 and 8 and primers with restriction sites are provided in Table 3 with SEQ ID no. 13 and 14 respectively). Cloning the gene at these enzymes sites in the vector pET28c  (     Figure 1     )  would allow the gene to express into a protein under the inducible T7 promoter with 6x His-tag at the C-terminal end. The uricase gene was amplified with these primers by standard PCR protocol mentioned above and the amplified products were purified using the gel purification kit as mentioned earlier. The amplified PCR products and pET 28c vector digested with the enzymes  Nco I and  Xho I (New England Biolabs, USA) for 3 hrs at 37 °C and digested products were gel purified. Insert and vector were added in the ratio 3:1 and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, USA) for 16hrs at 16 °C. The resulting plasmids were designated as pET28C- Kl UOM1 (mutant 1, SEQ ID No.5;    Figure 2     )  and pET28C- Kl UOM2 (mutant 2, SEQ ID No.6;    Figure 3     ).   
   
 Example 4: Expression and purification of the mutant uricases from  E. coli   
 
   
    
    [0068]
     The recombinant plasmids pET28C- Kl UOM1 (mutant 1, SEQ ID No.5) and pET28C- Kl UOM2 (mutant 2, SEQ ID No.6) were then transformed by heat shock method into the chemically competent  E. coli  strain BL21 (DE3) cells. Randomly selected colonies were inoculated in LB broth supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin antibiotics (LB+Kan) and incubated overnightat 37°C. The plasmids were isolated from the broth culture of clones using commercial plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). The presence of insert was confirmed in randomly selected colonies by both double digestion and PCR amplification of the insert. The positive clones carrying the recombinant plasmidspET28C- Kl UOM1 (mutant 1 SEQ ID No.5) and pET28C- Kl UOM2 (mutant 2 SEQ ID No.6) were in 20 ml LB+Kan broth and incubated at 37°C overnight.A 10 ml of overnight grown each seed culture were inoculated into 1,000 ml of fresh LB+Kan broth and was allowed to grow further at 37°C on a rotary shaking (200 rpm) incubator till it reached 0.6 - 0.8 OD at 600 nm. The protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG and the cells were allowed to grow further for 3 hr at 37°C in a rotary shaking (200 rpm) incubator. After 3 hr of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture for 15 min at 5,000 rpm at RT. The bacterial cell pellets wereresuspended uniformly in lysis buffer (5 ml/lgm of wet weight of cell pellet) using vortex or pipetteman. Lysis buffer constitutes 50 mMTris-HCL pH 8.5, 150 mMNaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.2 ml of protease cocktail Inhibitor (Sigma, USA). The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication (Sonics, USA); the sample was centrifuged and supernatant was taken in fresh tube. The Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column (Qiagen, Germany) was pre-equilibrated with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer (50 mMTris-HCL pH 8.5, 150 mMNaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT).After equilibrating, supernatant of protein preparation was added to the Ni-NTA column and allowed to pass. After passing the supernatant the column was washed with 25 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mMTris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mMNaCl, 1 mM DTT and 20 mM imidazole). After wash, the bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mMTris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mMNaCl, 1 mM DTT and 200 mM imidazole). The elutions were examined using 12 % SDS-PAGE. The elutions with visible protein band were pooled and dialyzed overnight against the dialysis buffer (50 mMTris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mMNaCl, 1 mM DTT) in cold room at 4°C.After Ni-NTA purification of recombinant proteins, a fewer contaminant protein could be removed by gel-filtration chromatography. We used Sephacryl S-200 column for protein purification (GE healthcare) installed in Biorad FPLC system. The technique was also used to analyze the hydrodynamic volume of proteins. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed against appropriate buffers using the Small Wonder-Lyzer dialysis bag (Excellion Innovations and Inventions Inc.,    US patent no. 6368509   ) having a 10 kDa molecular weight cut off (cellulose) membrane. 
   
 Example 5: Characterization of wild type and mutant uricases (mutant 1 & mutant 2) 
 
 
 1. Determination of optimum pH of uricases 
 
   
    
    [0069]
     To measure optimum pH of uricases the present invention used different pH buffers ranging from 3 to 12 and the uricases activity were assayed in each of these buffers under same conditions. Different buffers were used to provide desired pH for the assay. Citrate buffer for the pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer for pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, sodium tetra borate buffer for pH 8.5, 9.0, 10.0, sodium bicarbonate buffer for pH 11.0 and potassium chloride buffer for pH 12.0 were used. All these buffers were of 0.1 M concentration and adjusted to the final pH with respective bases or acids. The uric acid was dissolved in these buffers according to the final pH of the reaction. All other reagents were added in each reaction and finally equal amount of purified enzyme was added in all the wells to make up the volume of the assay mix to 300 µl. Incubated the mix at 25°C for 20 min and the reaction was stopped using KOH. Immediately the intensity of the color was measured in ELISA plate reader at 505 nm. The optimum pH for the wild type as well as both mutants was found to be pH 7 (Table 4), which is close to the biological pH.

 2. Kinetic studies of uricases 
 
   
    
    [0070]
     The kinetics of the uricases was studied to evaluate the efficiency of the enzymes. The kinetic parameters of the uricases of all the species were determined at their respective optimum pH and optimum temperatures. The substrate (uric acid) was added in increasing concentrations ranging from 10 to 600 µM (10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600) in triplicates. The assay reagents for the kinetic studies were added in 96 well plates in triplicates in the buffer of pH 7.0 and incubated at 35°C. Equal amounts of enzyme were added and immediately readings were taken at 505 nm. Around 30 readings were taken at the interval of 1min. The readings at a particular time point were taken for further steady state kinetic study of uricases. The K M  and V max  values were determined from Michaelis-Menten saturation curve by the non-linear curve fit (ORIGIN 7.5). kcat and kcat/K M  values were also calculated (table 5).
