Biological flora WM4. 
 The degradation of 6.3 food waste objects 
 Prepared by above-described embodiment 6.2 fixation flora (WM4) and commercially available microbial flora and food waste object (cold cuts and
Noodles) it is used with the ratio of 1:1 (w/w, weight in wet base).By fixation flora (WM4) that 50g is prepared by above-described embodiment 6.2 and it is used as
The commercially available microbial flora (50 grams, weight in wet base) of control group mixed respectively with 50g food waste object (weight in wet base) and 37 DEG C with
200rpm incubated under agitation.Cold cuts (50g, weight in wet base), raw noodles (50g, weight in wet base) (are wished into the private limited public affairs of general jeep food manufacturing
Department) and cold cuts and raw noodles (each 25g, weight in wet base) the substrate degraded as food waste object of combination, tested (Fig. 6-11). 
 6.4 solids reduce total amount and food waste object reduction amount 
 Measurement uses the total solid (food by the fixation flora (WM4) prepared of above embodiments 6.2 and commercially available microbial flora
Object waste+fixation microbial flora) weight loss and food waste object weight loss.Take 10 grams from embodiment 6.3
Different foodstuff samples (test group and control group) are simultaneously resuspended in 50ml water.By each sample thoroughly vortex 2-3 minutes, and
It is centrifuged 30 minutes in 4000rpm.It is each difference foodstuff samples particulate matter and substance not soluble in water each sample respectively
Falcon pipe in be deposited, and the soluble part in supernatant is decanted off.It is dry at 80 DEG C that there is particle
Falcon pipe, until not observing weight saving.Respectively in degradation 48 hours (meat and meat add noodles) and 120 hours
After (only noodles), calculates solid and reduce total amount and food waste object reduction amount (table 3). 
 The formula for calculating solid reduction total amount is: 
 
 
 
 A i : the initial dry weight of food waste object and microbial flora 
 A f : the final dry weight of food waste object and microbial flora after degradation 
 The formula for calculating food waste object reduction amount is: 
 
 
 
 A f : the final dry weight of food waste object and microbial flora after degradation 
 M i : the initial dry weight of microbial flora 
 F i : the initial dry weight of food waste object 
 Solid reduces total amount after table 3. is degraded and food waste object reduces total amount 
 
 
 
 As can be seen that only for the sample of noodles after 120 hours, the solid of WM4 reduces total amount and food waste object reduction amount
It is higher by 1.2 times and 1.4 times of commercially available microbial flora respectively.For the sample of only meat, after 48 hrs, the solid of WM4 subtracts
Few total amount and food waste object reduction amount are higher by 6.0 times and 4.4 times of commercially available microbial flora respectively.For meat and noodles sample
The combination of product, after 48 hrs, the solid of WM4 reduces total amount and food waste object reduction amount difference is 3.9 times and 2.3 times high.Cause
This, WM4 is more more efficient on degradation food waste object than commercially available microbial flora, because its palliating degradation degree is higher and operation temperature more
Low (< 40 DEG C).It is assumed that the degradation time of meat and noodles sample is shorter compared with the sample of only noodles, because meat is deposited
More nitrogen are provided in the growth for microbial strains. 
 6.5 be degraded food waste object pH value measurement 
 The solid sample (1.0g, weight in wet base) for being derived from the every kind of food waste object sample in degradation front and back is each added to 10ml certainly
In water.The degradation time of noodles is 120 hours, and only the degradation time of meat and meat and noodles sample is 48 hours.It will
Every kind of mixture is vortexed and is being stored at room temperature so that solid settles.Then the supernatant pH value (table 4) of each sample is measured. 
 The pH of the degradation of table 4. front and back solid sample changes (1g is dissolved in 10ml water) 
 
 
 
 It is noted that being increased in the case where noodles degradation using the pH value after WM4 and the degradation of commercially available microbial flora.
In the case where cold cuts and cold cuts and noodles combine, the reduction of pH is observed.Noodles, only meat and meat+noodles (WM4 and
Control group) catabolite HPLC analysis shows that there are a large amount of acetic acid and a small amount of butyric acid as main acidic materials.
