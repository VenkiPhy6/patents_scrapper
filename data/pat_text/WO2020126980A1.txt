 The present invention relates to active compound combinations comprising firstly at least one compound of formula (I) as shown below and secondly at least one active compound of group (II) selected from Biological Control Agent (BCA) Groups (1) to (7). Such combinations are highly suitable for controlling animal and microbial pests, such as unwanted insects and especially acarids (mites), and as plant strengthening agents.  
 Background  
 The compounds of formula (I) and methods for its production are known from WO 2006/089633 and their insecticidal action has been described.  
 However, the acaricidal and/or insecticidal efficacy and/or the activity spectrum and/or the compatibility of the known compounds with plants, especially with respect to crop plants, is not always satisfactory. Therefore, novel active compound combinations with improved properties are in great demand.  
 It has now been found that an active compound combination comprising at least one compound of the formula (I)  
   
 in which  
 W und Y independently of one another represent hydrogen, C  ]  -C^-alkyl, chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine,  
 X represents C  ]  -C^-alkyl, C  ]  -C^-alkoxy, chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine,  
 D represents hydrogen or methyl,  
 A and B and the carbon atom to which they are attached represent C 3 -C g - c y c 1 o a 1 k y 1 in which optionally one ring atom is replaced by a nitrogen and optionally monosubstituted by Ci-C 4 -alkoxy or  
 A, B and the carbon atom to which they are attached represent C3 - C g - c y c 1 a 1 k y 1 which is substituted by a C I -C^-alkyl- or a Ci-C 4 -alkoxy-Ci-C 2 -alkyl-substituierted alkylenedioxyl group which, together with the carbon atom to which it is attached, forms a five-membered or six-membered 

 ketal,  
 G represents hydrogen (a) or represents one of the groups 
 
 in which  
 E represents a metal ion or an ammonium ion,  
 M represents oxygen or sulphur,  
 R1 represents straight-chain or branched C  ]  -Cg-alkyl, represents straight-chain or branched C  ]  -Cg-alkyl, and at least one active compound of group (II) which is selected from Biological Control Agent (BCA) Groups (1) to (7), is highly suitable for the control of animal and microbial pests as well as plant strengthening agent. Especially, such active compound combinations have very good insecticidal, acaricidal and nematicidal properties.  
 Such active compound combinations are very suitable for controlling animal and microbial pests such as insects and/or arachnids, especially acarids, and/or nematodes and/or fungi, and indirectly improve plant health. Further, such active compound combinations can be used for reducing overall damage of plants and plant parts as well as losses in harvested fruits or vegetables caused by such pests, e.g. insects, mites and phytopathogens. Further, such active compound combinations are suitable as plant strengthening agents.  
 For some active compound combinations according to the invention, it might be possible that the insecticidal effect and/or arachnicidal/acaricidal effect and/or nematicidal effect and/or antimicrobial effect and/or the fungicidal effect and/or the plant-strengthening effect and/or the yield-increasing effect is substantially higher than the sum of the effects of the individual active ingredients. For such active compound combinations a synergistic effect will be present.  
 Group II consists of

 An individual embodiment refers to an active compound combination according to the present invention, wherein the compound of group (II) is selected from the group consisting of Biological Control Agent (BCA) Groups (1) to (7). 

 Mixing ratio  
 The compounds of the formula (I) and the biological control agent as defined above of the mixture or composition according to the invention can be combined in any specific ratio between these two mandatory components. A biological control agent is generally provided in form of a carrier such as a solution or powder or suspension comprising the biological control agent (e.g.in form of viable spores or conidia or an extract). In one preferred embodiment, the amount of viable spores or conidia per gramm compound of formula (I) in a mixture or composition according to the inve ntion normally provided in/on a carrier is at least 10 7  viable spores or conidia / g compound of formula (I), such as between 10 7  and 10 14  viable spores or conidia / g compound of formula (I), more preferably at least 10 s  viable spores or conidia / g compound of formula (I), such as between between 10 s  and 5xl0 13  viable spores or conidia / g compound of formula (I), or even more preferably at least 10 9  viable spores or conidia / g compound of formula (I), such as between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores or conidia / g compound of formula (I).  
 The term“viability” of spores or conidia refers to the ability of spores or conidia to germinate at standard conditions and under sufficient supply of nutritions, water, light and/or further support such as growth media. Viability of spores and conidia can be easily determined by a person skilled in the art, e.g. by counting colonies formed by spores/conidia on a growth medium suitable for species to be tested. In addition, many assays are available in the art to determine viability of spores and/or conidia, e.g., Chen et al (Can. J. Plant Pathol., 24; 230-232 (2002); Paul et al (Biotech. And Bioengeneering, 42; 11-23 (1993); Panahiam et al (International Research Journal of Applied and Basic Science, 3(2); 292-298 (2012) or Laflamme et al (J. of applied Microbiol. 96; 684-692 (2004)).  
 In one preferred embodiment, wherein the biological control agent is a natural extract or simulated blend, the ratio is measured in view of the amount of biological active agent(s) in the extract or simulated blend. Thus, the ratio of an extract or simulated blend is based on the amount of active ingredient and not on the amount of the whole extract or blend. For example, a weight ratio of 1 : 1 of a compound according to formula (I) and a biological control agent (II) in form of a natural extract or simulated blend with 16.75% (w/w) active ingredient(s), such as terpenes, refers to a mixture or composition comprising, e.g., 1 g of a compound according to formula (I) and 5.97 g of the natural extract or simulated blend comprising 16.75% active ingredient(s) (biological control agent (II)), i.e. 1 g active ingredient(s) (biological control agent (II)) resulting in a 1 : 1 mixture in view of a compound of formual (I) and the active ingredient(s) (biological control agent (II)).  
 Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the mixing ratio in mixtures of a compound of formula (I) and natural extracts or simulated blend of, e.g., Chenopodium ambrosioides is 1500: 1 to 1 :2000. Such as 1: 1 to 1 :2000 or 1 : 1 to 1:2000 or 1 :1 to 1 : 1500 or 1 : 10 to 1 : 1500 or 1 : 1 to 1 :250 or 1:5 to 1 : 100 or 1 : 10 to 1 :25. One natural extract or simulated blend of Chenopodium ambrosioides is known as Requiem. The active ingredient(s) concentration in Requiem is 16,75% (w/w) terpenes, i.e. a mixture of a-terpinene, p-cymene and limonene. As outlined above, the weight ratio of a compound of formula (I) and active ingredient(s) 

 of Requiem can be calculated by using the concentration of said active ingredients in the natural extract or simulated blend. The skilled person is aware how to calculate the concentration of, e.g., terpenes. Analytical methods are known from, e.g., Goren et al (0939D5075/2003/0900D0687 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen, (2003), http://www.znaturforsch.com); Kimball et al (J. of Chrom. Science, 42; 245-249 (2004), Davidowski, Perkin Elmer for the Better, http://www.perkinelmer.com/Content/applicationnotes/app_limoneneincitrusrindsbygcms.pdf

 For example, the ratio of viable conidia of Metarhizium anisopliae (e.g. Met 52, e.g., with a concentration of 5 x 10 9  viable conidia/g solid form carrier) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 s  and 10 13  viable conidia / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable conidia / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 12  viable conidia / g compound of formula (I) such as between 3xl0 10  and 7xlO n  viable conidia / g compound of formula (I).  
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (e.g. PreFeRal, for example with a concentration of 2 x 10 9  viable spores/g solution) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 n  and 3xl0 12  viable spores / g compound of formula (I).  
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of Beauveria bassiana (e.g., Naturalis-F, for example with a concentration of 2.3 x 10 7  viable spores/ml solution) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 5xl0 9  and 10 12  viable spores / g compound of formula (I) such as between 5xl0 9  and 5xlO n  viable spores / g compound of formula (I).  
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of Paecilomyces lilacinus (e.g., Paecilomyces lilacinus strain 251 (BioAct), for example with a concentration of 10 10  viable spores/g carrier) per gr compound of formula (I)) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 14  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 10  and 10 14  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 5xlO n  and 5xl0 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 12  and 5xl0 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I).  
 In another preferred embodiment, the mixing ratio in mixtures or compositions of a compound of formula (I) and bacteria (which are, e.g. provided in form of a solution or solid form (e.g. a powder) with viable 

 spores) is between 10 7  and 10 14  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), preferably between 10 s  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 9  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 10  and 10 12  viable spores / g compound of formula (I).  
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of Bacillus thuringiensis (e.g., B. thuringiensis subsp. aizawai ABTS-1857 (XenTari), for example with a concentration of 1.5 x 10 7  viable spores/g carrier) per gr compound of formula (I) is preferably between 10 s  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 8  and 10 n  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 9  and 10 n  viable spores / g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 9  and 5xl0 10  viable spores / g compound of formula (I).  
 For example, the ratio of viable spores of Bacillus firmus (including but not limited to strain CNCM I- 1582, for example with a concentration of 1.5 x 10 7  viable spores/g carrier) per gr compound of formula (I) is preferably between 10 8  and 10 13  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), more preferably between 10 8  and 10 n  viable spores / g compound of formula (I), even more preferably between 10 9  and 10 n  viable spores / g compound of formula (I) such as between 10 9  and 5xl0 10  viable spores / g compound of formula 
 (I)·  
 The insecticidal and/or acaricidal action of the active compound combinations of the invention is, surprisingly, substantially higher than the sum of the actions of the individual active compounds. The unforeseeable effect is a true synergistic effect and not merely a complementarity of action.  
 The active compound combinations comprise the compound of the formula (I) and the compound of group 
 (II) preferably in synergistically effective amounts.  
 When the active compounds are present in the active compound combinations of the invention in certain proportions by weight, the synergistic effect is particularly marked. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within a relatively broad range. Generally speaking, the combinations according to the invention comprise active compounds of the formula (I) and the co-components in the preferred, particularly preferred and very particularly preferred proportions indicated in the tables which now follow:  
 * The mixing ratios are based on weight ratios. The ratio is to be understood as meaning active compound of the formula (I) : Co-component

 Formulations  
 The present invention further relates to formulations and use forms prepared therefrom as pesticides, for example drench, drip and spray liquors, comprising an active compound combination according to the invention. In some cases, the use forms comprise further pesticides and/or adjuvants which improve action, such as penetrants, e.g. vegetable oils, for example rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, mineral oils, for example paraffin oils, alkyl esters of vegetable fatty acids, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, or alkanol alkoxylates and/or spreaders, for example alkylsiloxanes and/or salts, for example organic or inorganic ammonium or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or di ammonium hydrogenphosphate and/or retention promoters, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate or hydroxypropyl guar polymers and/or humectants, for example glycerol and/or fertilizers, for example ammonium-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilizers.  
 Customary formulations are, for example, water-soluble liquids (SL), emulsion concentrates (EC), emulsions in water (EW), suspension concentrates (SC, SE, FS, OD), water-dispersible granules (WG), granules (GR) and capsule concentrates (CS); these and further possible formulation types are described, for example, by Crop Life International and in Pesticide Specifications, Manual on development and use 

 of FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides, FAO Plant Production and Protection Papers - 173, prepared by the FAO/WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications, 2004, ISBN: 9251048576. The formulations, in addition to the active compound combination according to the invention, optionally comprise further agrochemically active compounds.  
 These are preferably formulations or use forms which comprise auxiliaries, for example extenders, solvents, spontaneity promoters, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, frost protectants, biocides, thickeners and/or further auxiliaries, for example adjuvants. An adjuvant in this context is a component which enhances the biological effect of the formulation, without the component itself having any biological effect. Examples of adjuvants are agents which promote retention, spreading, attachment to the leaf surface or penetration.  
 These formulations are prepared in a known way, for example by mixing the active compound combination according to the invention with auxiliaries such as, for example, extenders, solvents and/or solid carriers and/or other auxiliaries such as, for example, surfactants. The formulations are prepared either in suitable facilities or else before or during application.  
 The auxiliaries used may be substances suitable for imparting special properties, such as certain physical, technical and/or biological properties, to the formulation of the active compound combination according tot he invention, or to the use forms prepared from these formulations (for example ready-to-use pesticides such as spray liquors or seed dressing products).  
 Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzenes), the alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), the esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the unsubstituted and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulphones and sulphoxides (such as dimethyl sulphoxide), the carbonates and the nitriles.  
 If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, carbonates such as propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate or dibutyl carbonate, or nitriles such as acetonitrile or propanenitrile.  
 In principle, it is possible to use all suitable solvents. Examples of suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic 

 hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, chloroethylene or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, paraffins, petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, carbonates such as propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate or dibutyl carbonate, nitriles such as acetonitrile or propanenitrile, and also water.  
 In principle, it is possible to use all suitable carriers. Useful carriers include especially: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as finely divided silica, alumina and natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes and/or solid fertilizers. Mixtures of such carriers can likewise be used. Useful carriers for granules include: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and also granules of organic material such as sawdust, paper, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks.  
 Liquefied gaseous extenders or solvents can also be used. Particularly suitable extenders or carriers are those which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellant gases, such as halohydrocarbons, and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.  
 Examples of emulsifiers and/or foam-formers, dispersants or wetting agents with ionic or nonionic properties, or mixtures of these surfactants, are salts of polyacrylic acid, salts of lignosulphonic acid, salts of phenolsulphonic acid or naphthalenesulphonic acid, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, with substituted phenols (preferably alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic esters, taurine derivatives (preferably alkyl taurates), isethionate derivatives, phosphoric esters of polyethoxylated alcohols or phenols, fatty esters of polyols, and derivatives of the compounds containing sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, protein hydrolysates, lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. The presence of a surfactant is advantageous if at least one of the compounds of the active compound combination according to the invention and/or one of the inert carriers is insoluble in water and when the application takes place in water.  
 It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and nutrients and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc as further auxiliaries in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom.  
 Additional components may be stabilizers, such as low-temperature stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers or other agents which improve chemical and/or physical stability. Foam formers or antifoams may also be present. 

 Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids may also be present as additional auxiliaries in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. Further possible auxiliaries are mineral and vegetable oils.  
 Optionally, further auxiliaries may be present in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. Examples of such additives include fragrances, protective colloids, binders, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrants, retention promoters, stabilizers, sequestrants, complexing agents, humectants, spreaders. In general, the active compound combination according tot he invention can be combined with any solid or liquid additive commonly used for formulation purposes.  
 Useful retention promoters include all those substances which reduce the dynamic surface tension, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate, or increase the viscoelasticity, for example hydroxypropylguar polymers.  
 Suitable penetrants in the present context are all those substances which are usually used for improving the penetration of agrochemical active compounds into plants. Penetrants are defined in this context by their ability to penetrate from the (generally aqueous) application liquor and/or from the spray coating into the cuticle of the plant and thereby increase the mobility of active compounds in the cuticle. The method described in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science 51, 131-152) can be used to determine this property. Examples include alcohol alkoxylates such as coconut fatty ethoxylate (10) or isotridecyl ethoxylate (12), fatty acid esters, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, fatty amine alkoxylates, for example tallowamine ethoxylate (15), or ammonium and/or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate.  
 The formulations preferably comprise between 0.00000001 and 98% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention or, with particular preference, between 0.01% and 95% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention, more preferably between 0.5% and 90% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention, based on the weight of the formulation.  
 The content of the compound of the active compound combination according to the invention in the use forms prepared from the formulations (in particular pesticides) may vary within wide ranges. The concentration of the active compound combination according to the invention in the use forms is usually between 0.00000001 and 95% by weight of the active compound combination according to the invention, preferably between 0.00001 and 1% by weight, based on the weight of the use form. The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.  
 Plants and plant parts 

 All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Here, plants are to be understood to mean all plants and plant parts such as wanted and unwanted wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants), for example cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya bean, potato, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, melon, carrot, watermelon, onion, lettuce, spinach, leek, beans, Brassica oleracea (e.g. cabbage) and other vegetable species, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape, and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant varieties which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. Plants should be understood to mean all developmental stages, such as seeds, seedlings, young (immature) plants up to mature plants. Plant parts should be understood to mean all parts and organs of the plants above and below ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples given being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds, and also tubers, roots and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants or harvested plant parts and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.  
 Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compound combination according to the invention is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.  
 As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and also parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term“parts” or“parts of plants” or“plant parts” has been explained above. The invention is used with particular preference to treat plants of the respective commercially customary cultivars or those that are in use. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having new properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, varieties, bio- or genotypes.  
 Transgenic plant, seed treatment and integration events  
 The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated with preference in accordance with the invention include all plants which, through the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particular advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to levels of water or soil salinity, enhanced flowering 

 performance, easier harvesting, accelerated ripening, higher yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage life and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are increased resistance of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, arachnids, nematodes, mites, slugs and snails owing, for example, to toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof), furthermore increased resistance of the plants against phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses owing, for example, to systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and also resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question may also be present in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetable, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), with particular emphasis being given to maize, soya beans, wheat, rice, potatoes, cotton, sugar cane, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of the plants to insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails.  
 Crop protection - types of treatment  
 The treatment of the plants and plant parts with the compounds of the active compound combination according to the invention is carried out directly or by action on their surroundings, habitat or storage space using customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, atomizing, irrigating, evaporating, dusting, fogging, broadcasting, foaming, painting, spreading-on, injecting, watering (drenching), drip irrigating and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, furthermore as a powder for dry seed treatment, a solution for liquid seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for slurry treatment, by incrusting, by coating with one or more coats, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compound combination according to the invention by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the application form or the active compound combination according to the invention itself into the soil.  
 A preferred direct treatment of the plants is foliar application, i.e. the active compound combination according to the invention is applied to the foliage, where treatment frequency and the application rate should be adjusted according to the level of infestation with the pest in question.  
 In the case of systemically active compounds, the active compound combination according to the invention also access the plants via the root system. The plants are then treated by the action of the active compound combination according to the invention on the habitat of the plant. This may be done, for 

 example, by drenching, or by mixing into the soil or the nutrient solution, i.e. the locus of the plant (e.g. soil or hydroponic systems) is impregnated with a liquid form of the active compound combination according to the invention, or by soil application, i.e. the active compound combination according to the invention is introduced in solid form (e.g. in the form of granules) into the locus of the plants, or by drip application (often also referred to as "chemigation"), i.e. the liquid application of the active compound combination according to the invention from surface or sub-surface driplines over a certain period of time together with varying amounts of water at defined locations in the vicinity of the plants. In the case of paddy rice crops, this can also be done by metering the active compound combination according to the invention in a solid application form (for example as granules) into a flooded paddy field.  
 The plants listed can be treated particularly advantageously according to the invention with the active compound combinations according to the invention. The preferred ranges given above in the active compound combinations also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is placed on the plant treatment with the active compound combinations specifically mentioned in the present text.  
 Formula for the efficacy of the combination of two compounds  
 The expected efficacy of a given combination of two compounds is calculated as follows (see Colby, S.R.,„Calculating Synergistic and antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 15, pp. 20-22, 1967):  
 If  
 X is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control for test compound A at a concentration of m ppm or m g/ha,  
 Y is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control for test compound B at a concentration of n ppm or n g/ha,  
 E is the efficacy expressed in % mortality of the untreated control using the mixture of A and B at m and n ppm respectively m and n g/ha,  
 X x Y  
 then is E = X + Y - 
 100  
 If the observed insecticidal efficacy of the combination is higher than the one calculated as„E“, then the combination of the two compounds is more than additive, i.e., there is a synergistic effect. 

 Example A  
 Aphis gossvpii - spray test  
 Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide  
 Emulsifier: alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and is diluted with water, containing an emulsifier concentration of lOOOppm, to the desired concentration. Further test concentrations are prepared by dilution with emulsifier containing water. Ammonium salt and/or penetration enhancer in a dosage of lOOOppm are added to the desired concentration if necessary. Cotton leaves ( Gossypium hirsutum ) which are heavily infested with the cotton aphid ( Aphis gossypii ) are treated by being sprayed with the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration.  
 After the specified period of time the mortality in % is determined. 100 % means all the aphids have been killed; 0 % means none of the aphids have been killed. The mortality values determined thus are recalculated using the Colby-formula (see sheet 1). According to the present application in this test e.g. the following combination shows a synergistic effect in comparison to the single compounds:

  * obs. = observed efficacy; ** cal. = efficacy calculated with Colby-formula 

 Example B  
 Mvzus persicae - spray test  
 Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide  
 Emulsifier: alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and is diluted with water, containing an emulsifier concentration of lOOOppm, to the desired concentration. Further test concentrations are prepared by dilution with emulsifier containing water. Ammonium salt in a dosage of lOOOppm is added to the desired concentration.  
 Cabbage leaves ( Brassica oleracea ) which are heavily infested by the green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae ) are treated by being sprayed with the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration.  
 After the specified period of time mortality in % is determined. 100 % means all the aphids have been killed; 0 % means none of the aphids have been killed. The mortality values determined thus are recalculated using the Colby-formula (see sheet 1). According to the present application in this test e.g. the following combinations show a synergistic effect in comparison to the single compounds:  
 Table B: Myzus persicae - spray test
