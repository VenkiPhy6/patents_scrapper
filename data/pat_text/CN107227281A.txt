 Technical field 
 The invention belongs to microbial technology field, it is related to the skill of a kind of streptomycete novel bacterial and its application in disinfectant
Art field. 
 
 
 Technical background 
 Sterilization refers to remove or kill livestock and poultry body surface and its existence with suitable method according to different production links, object
Pathogenic microorganism and other harmful microorganisms in environment.Under the higher and higher trend of current intensive degree, farm is cultivated
Disease incidence becomes increasingly complex, and it is very prominent that animal epidemic prevents and treats problem.Scale livestock farming epidemic disease be often it is many because
The result of plain comprehensive function, but wherein it is topmost be due to pathogenic microorganism in external environment intrusion and diffusion or field in move
The diffusion of thing microbiological contamination itself is caused.Effective sterilization is to prevent and reduce the pathogen in plant's environment, is cut
Disconnected epidemic disease route of transmission, one of prevention and the important measures of control plant infectious disease.But use existing disinfectant often
There are the resistance pathogenic bacteria of residual after sterilization, using effect is undesirable, it is impossible to effectively prevent and treat some scale livestock farming epidemic diseases,
Such as cow subclinical mastitis recurrent exerbation, it is difficult to cure, the chronic illness as livestock-raising industry. 
 Recent study finds that biofilm is to cause these pathogenic bacteria to be difficult to the main cause eradicated, with biofilm
The bacterium that form is present is different from planktonic bacteria, and they are to the bactericide such as antibiotic, adverse circumstances and host immune defenses mechanism
There is the bacterium in very strong resistance, biofilm in physiology, metabolism, the degraded to substrate or utilization and to the resistivity of environment
In terms of all there is unique property, it is to be extremely difficult to preferably disappear to carry out elimination to these pathogenic bacteria with existing disinfectant
Toxic effect fruit, and the disinfectant containing bioflm inhibiting agents can solve this problem well, significantly lift Disinfection Effect,
It is one type using the bioflm inhibiting agents of micro-organisms, some actinomyces, which can produce, suppresses bacterial biof iotalm formation
Active material, such as indoles, protease, entirely different with conventional antibiotic mechanism of action, these active materials are not
On the premise of influenceing growth of pathogenic bacteria, by disturbing pathogen biofilm formation related gene expression to realize inhibitory action.With
Traditional antibiosis and sterilization agent is compared, and novel membrane-biological membrane inhibitory activity material can alleviate bacterial drug resistance and ask to a certain extent
Topic.Therefore, bacterial biof iotalm formation inhibitor is as new disinfectant composition, in pre- preventing microorganism especially biomembrane infection field
Have broad application prospects, but it is seldom for the report of disinfectant on microbial biofilm inhibitor at present, it is therefore desirable to
The biomembrane inhibitory action of microorganism is further probed into, suppresses to provide with biofilm formation inhibitory action for microbial biofilm
And the stable resistant strain of performance, there will be potential application and development prospect in disinfectant field. 
 
 
 The content of the invention 
 For having no the correlation about the streptomycete novel bacterial in the present invention and the application in disinfectant in the prior art
Report, and existing disinfectant also has the resistance pathogenic bacteria of residual after sterilization, using effect is undesirable, it is impossible to effectively prevent and treat rule
The present situation of modelling plant epidemic disease, it is contemplated that to be provided in disinfectant with biofilm formation inhibitory action and performance stabilization
The new bacterial strain of resistance.The present invention has generation by separating a streptomycete novel bacterial in pedotheque
Enzyme ability is higher so as to which its zymotic fluid has significant biomembrane inhibitory action.By providing a kind of salt lake streptomycete
(Streptomyces salilacus) TRM20170601CGMCC No.14260, and the bacterium zymotic fluid in disinfectant
Application technology scheme.

Salilacus) influence of the zymotic fluid to suppression biofilm formation 
 1st, test method 
 Bacterium solution is pressed 1:100 dilution proportions, zymotic fluid is filtered through sterilised membrane filter, and the zymotic fluid after processing is pressed into various concentrations
(10%~50%) is mixed with bacterium solution, and 20 μ L to 96 orifice plates, each hole of gradient 4,37 DEG C of constant incubator are drawn after mixing
Quiescent culture 24h, surveying OD590 (needs verification to be OD590 or OD 590 , similarly hereinafter), the slow board-washing of flowing water 3 times is not sticked with washing away
Attached bacteria.Baking oven is put into, 56 DEG C, 1h is dried, with 0.5% violet staining 5min, flowing water is rinsed, unnecessary crystal violet dye is washed away
Liquid, dries naturally, surveys OD490. 
 Relative biological film Forming ability=(treatment group OD490/ blank OD490) × 100. 
 2. different temperatures is to salt lake streptomycete (Streptomyces salilacus) TRM20170601 CGMCC
No.14260 zymotic fluids suppress the influence of MRSE biofilm formation ability 
 Temperature is -20 DEG C and is set to untreated fish group, treatment group temperature is respectively：30℃、40℃、60℃、80℃、100℃
By zymotic fluid with after different temperatures water bath processing 30min, as a result as shown in Figure 3, the Relative biological when albumen temperature is -20 DEG C
Film Forming ability is 51.36%；With respect to biofilm formation ability it is 52.02% when temperature is 30 DEG C；Temperature is relative when being 40 DEG C
Biofilm formation ability is 49.88%；With respect to biofilm formation ability it is 37.89% when temperature is 60 DEG C；When temperature is 80 DEG C
Relative biological film Forming ability is 54.68%；With respect to biofilm formation ability it is 59.04% when temperature is 100 DEG C；Temperature is 60
DEG C when zymotic fluid suppress MRSE biofilm formation ability it is most strong. 
 3. different pH value are to salt lake streptomycete (Streptomyces salilacus) TRM20170601 CGMCC
No.14260 zymotic fluids suppress the influence of MRSE biofilm formation ability 
 It is untreated fish group using pH value as 7, zymotic fluid is adjusted to different pH value respectively, surveys it to MRSE ATCC
The influence of 35984 Relative biological film Forming abilities, as a result as shown in Figure 4, the relative biofilm formation when the pH value of albumen is 3
Ability is 27.47%；With respect to biofilm formation ability it is 30.24% when pH value is 5；PH value be 7 when with respect to biofilm formation energy
Power is 38.54%；With respect to biofilm formation ability it is 25.74% when pH value is 9；PH value be 11 when with respect to biofilm formation ability
For 10.94%；When pH value is 11, relative biofilm formation ability is most weak, its biomembrane inhibiting rate highest.
