Method 
 
 Technical field 
 Glu is produced the present invention relates to a kind of microorganism for producing Glu and using the microorganism
Method. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Glu is as the amino acid being widely used in medicine, cosmetics and health food, mainly using compound
It is prepared by resistance or compound responsive microorganism.For example, sulfaguanidine resistance bacterial strain (JP 1978-17675), azaserine are anti-
Property microorganism (JP 1980-148094), penicillin sensitivity microorganism (JP1992-088994) and tyrosine glutamic acid (tyr-
Glu)-resistant strain (JP 1990-186994) has been used to these purposes. 
 In these cases, in the research process of bacterial strain of the exploitation with improved Glu productivity, this hair
A person of good sense is found that the mutant resistant to high concentration Glu and the L- paddy of high yield is produced by using mutant
The method of glutamine, so as to complete the present invention. 
 
 
 The content of the invention 
 [technical problem] 
 The present invention provides a kind of Corynebacterium glutamicum for the Glu productivity for having and improving
(Corynebacterium glutamicum) mutant. 
 The present invention provides a kind of method that Glu is produced by using Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant body. 
 [technical scheme] 
 According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a kind of generation Glu resistant to Glu
Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant body. 
 As used herein, term " Glu " refers to the monoamides of glutamic acid, and it is the amino acid for constituting protein
With with formula H 2 NCO-CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ) COOH l-amino acid. 
 As used herein, statement " resistant to Glu " refers to have with high concentration Glu
It can be grown in environment or be able to maintain that or increase the microorganism for the characteristic for producing Glu activity. 
 When Glu builds up to a certain concentration or higher concentration in cell, this can be induced by feedback regulation
Suppress, cause to forbid or suppress the activity of glutamine synthelase, and therefore suppress the biosynthesis of Glu.L- paddy ammonia
The feedback regulation of acid amides is released, and Glu synthesis suppression in the bacterial strain resistant to Glu not
Work so that Glu resistant strain can produce Glu under conditions of high concentration Glu. 
 Mutant can be Corynebacterium glutamicum KCCM 11553P or Corynebacterium glutamicum KCCM 11554P. 
 Mutant can be resistant to the Glu of high concentration.For example, mutant can have about 5g/L to about
The resistance of 30g/L Glu, and in some embodiments, the Glu with about 15g/L to about 30g/L
Resistance, and in some other embodiments, the resistance with about 20g/L to about 25g/L Glu. 
 Mutant can be survived in the minimal medium containing about 15g/L to about 25g/L Glu about 6 days or
For more time.For example, mutant can be in the Glu containing about 15g/L to about 25g/L, 0.1% glucose, 0.04% sulphur
Sour magnesium (MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O), 0.1% potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2 PO 4 ), 0.0001% thiamine HCl, 200 μ g/L biotins and
Survived in the minimal medium (pH 7.0) of agar under about 30 DEG C of culture about 6 days or the longer time.
