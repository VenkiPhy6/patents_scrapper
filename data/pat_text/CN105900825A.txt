 Invention brief introduction introduction 
 
 The present invention relates to Cortex jatrophae plant, botany is referred to as the Radix Euphorbiae Pekinensis (Euphorbiaceae) section Cortex jatrophae, that is
Usually said " leprosy " (Physic Nut).Leprosy belongs to and includes the perennial arbor of meat more than 175 kinds or filling
Wood.Cortex jatrophae is derived from Hispanic drought resisting perennial plant, the subtropical and tropical zones of throughout world,
Including India, Africa, Asia and North America. 
 More specifically, Jatropha curcas is diploid (2N=22) little tree or shrub, has smooth, Lycoperdon polymorphum Vitt or pale red
Bark, during cutting flow out white water-borne latex.Cortex jatrophae typically grows to three to five meters high, but in favourable growth
Under the conditions of, it can grow to eight to ten meters.Even if planting on barren soil, Cortex jatrophae plant also has vigorous
Growth rate, and the generation of fruit and seed was for up to 50 years.The seed oil-producing of Jatropha curcas plant, adds
Can be as diesel oil and the succedaneum of jet fuel after work. 
 Jatropha curcas plant as the assemblage characteristic of non-agronomic crops, the cultivation adaptability in semiarid and lean soil,
And the seed oil content height produced, cause the interest of crop improvement plan.But, up to now, only
Limited document and relevant hereditary information contribute to the improvement of Jatropha curcas plant merit, as the most ripe, carry
				
Prematurity, increases female blooming, and increases fruit and seed amount, and increases oil production. 
 For other cross-pollinatd plants, feature is entered by the most effective and economic breeding using hybridization and selection course
Row changes or improvement.Use two kinds of different mother plant colonies, obtain in hybrid maximum genetic identity with
And improve vigor and yield, this can be realized by different conventional methods. 
 First method is asexual (nutrition) breeding.By this method, all of plant both is from single plant,
This plant itself is probably result or the result of unique heredity selection of the hybrid of two kinds of different parental plants. 
 Second method is selfing line seed (sexual) breeding, and this will produce unified plant population.Selfing line is originated
In autophilous process, in usually more than 6 generations or more, so that homologous chromosome is to upper all allele
To isozygotying or identical.In strain, every generation selfing degree (homozygote) is close to 50%, therefore to the 6th generation purity be 98.4
%, the 7th on behalf of 99.2%.Hereafter, what self-pollination in isolates, adelphogamy or randomer hybridization obtained is all
On plant genetics the most identical, therefore, isozygoty and unified appearance. 
 But, selfing can not get maximum plant yield.During selfing, performance, yield and plant size reduce.This
Planting the plant vigor reduction that selfing causes, be referred to as " inbreeding depression ", this is that unified selfing line usually will not be as business
The reason of industry plant growth. 
 The third method producing unified plant population is two hybridizations between selfed lines, produces unification, the first generation (F1)
Hybridization population.Due to hybrid vigor (hybrid vigor), maximum output and uniformity are achieved.As detailed below,
The present invention uses the method produce the first generation (F1) Jatropha curcas hybrid and gather in the crops seed. 
 
 
 
 Invention brief introduction 
 
 This description relate to produce FO Cortex jatrophae offspring " the most female " (FO) Jatropha curcas plant, and from
There is the heterozygote plant that FO character plant produces. 
 The most in one aspect, present description provides and be characterized as the Jatropha curcas plant of only female flower inflorescence.At one
In preferred embodiment, the essentially all inflorescence that Jatropha curcas plant produces only produces female flower. 
 On the other hand, present description provides the method producing hybridization Jatropha curcas seed.The method includes that (1) exists
Interplant the first A phenotype Jatropha curcas plant in field and the second be different from the B phenotype Jatropha curcas plant of A phenotype,
Thus the pollen exchange carried out in described field is limited only to described first and second plants, then (2) are from institute
State results fruit in the first plant, from the first plant described, therefore obtain F1 hybridize (AxB) seed. 
 In the method, A phenotype comprises the feature only opening female flower, and B phenotype does not has.The field of interplanting is preferred
It is positioned at the area substantially not having other Jatropha curcas plant, the probability that the leprosy plant outside described field pollinates i.e. occurs
Minimum. 
 In another embodiment, the first plant is the homozygous line of FO character.Can be cloned by asexual propagation
Property expands this first plant.In another embodiment, the first plant and the second plant from different from
Hand over system.These strains are preferably different on hereditism, the first and the second plant hybridization time institute proceeded as above
The F1 hybrid generation produced shows vigor and the seed production being better than arbitrary parental line. 
 
 
 Accompanying drawing explanation 
 Fig. 1 provides the close-up illustration of the Jatropha curcas plant with FO character, i.e. plant generation only has female flower
Inflorescence. 
 Fig. 2 provides the close-up illustration of normally (wild type) Jatropha curcas plant, and its generation has male flower and female flower simultaneously
Inflorescence. 
 
 Detailed Description Of The Invention 
 
 This specification relates to selection and the purposes of Jatropha curcas phenotype, be characterized as produce inflorescence have simultaneously female flower and
The common Jatropha curcas of male flower is compared, it is characterised in that the inflorescence of generation only has female flower. 
 The uniqueness of this specification is also resided in and provides the unification being obtained commercial size number by seminal propagation first
The hybridization example of F1 Jatropha curcas hybrid.In this regard, can produce by the following method hybridization Jatropha curcas seed: (1)
Interplant the first A phenotype Jatropha curcas plant in the fields and the second is different from the B phenotype Jatropha curcas of A phenotype and plants
Strain, thus the pollen exchange carried out in described field is limited only to described first and second plants, then (2)
From the first plant described, gather in the crops fruit, from the first plant described, therefore obtain F1 hybridize (AxB) seed.
A phenotype comprises the feature only opening female flower, and B phenotype does not has.Parental line is preferably different on hereditism, as
When carrying out the first and the hybridization of the second plant described on, produced F1 hybrid generation shows and is better than arbitrary parent
The vigor of strain and seed production. 
 Therefore, FO Jatropha curcas plant disclosed herein can produce biology with other the same being used for of Jatropha curcas plant
Fuel or as hedge.But, the feature of FO makes this Jatropha curcas plant be better than wild type Jatropha curcas plant.Such as,
FO character can efficiently produce F1 hybrid seed, and its labour force expended and soil are only and produce and transport nothing of sprouting
A part for the F1 hybrid plant of sexual reproduction.Additionally, with cuttage gained hybrid plant conversely, because be from results
F1 hybrid seed growth, interplanting produce F1 hybrid plant there is more preferable root growth. 
 In this specification, the definition of following term and phrase is used for showing that the present invention and guides reader to put into practice.Unless otherwise
Shown in, it should understand word used herein according to usual usage.This specification is referred to asexual and sexual reproduction method
Common technology. 
 Cultivar or kind are one group belongs to the similar plant of same species, and its construction features and characteristic can be distinguished
				
Other kind in same species.Two basic features of kind are homogeny and reproducibility.Homogeny is necessary
, make this kind can be distinguished from other kinds in crop species and distinguish.Distinguishing characteristic can be form
Feature, color mark, physiological function, disease reaction or performance, but the particularly important is FO character in this article. 
 Major part variety of crops feature is pure or pure to the feature of those identification of species itself.Reproducibility is must
Want, in order to the feature of identification of species reproduces in offspring.From term single gene type or the population of mixing genotype breeding,
It is referred to as " strain ".Once it is determined that strain is superior, it can be named, breed and as the commercialization " product of cultivation
Kind " or " cultivar ". 
 Therefore, in this manual, term " cultivar " and " kind " same meaning, refer to that species (herein refer to fiber crops
Crazy tree) in one group of plant, it has feature that some is fixing, and including FO character, these features make it distinguish
Other in usual form and species may kind." kind " of the present invention at least has FO specific characteristic
Meanwhile, it is further characterized in that a large amount of overall variability between individuality in kind, is based primarily upon the Mendel of character between offspring
Separate.On the other hand, " cultivar " or " kind " also may indicate that a clone, because Cortex jatrophae cultivar
Can replicate separately through cuttage asexual propagation, and all of upper essence of clone's heredity is identical. 
 Different from " kind ", it is less for making a variation between individuality after self-pollination by number that " strain " is usually (but non-exclusive)
One group of plant.For purposes of the present invention, the definition of " strain " is enough extensive, including using cuttage or tissue training
The technology of supporting is from the vegetative one group of plant of single parental plant. 
 Observe the hereditary pattern of FO character and phenotype or the single recessive gene seat phase of character showing FO when isozygotying
With.Owing to the plant of FO lacks male flower, self-fertilization cannot show " really breeding " state of character, i.e. cannot
Observe the significant amount of state of independent separate character in offspring.By contrast, FO character heterozygous plant and open country
Raw type has hermaphrodite flower and can self-pollination.The ratio that the offspring that this self-pollination produces reproduces FO character is the most every
, there is 1 strain FO in 3 strain wild types, and this is consistent with the character of recessive character.Similarly, FO character is showed
Plant, the plant born of the same parents pollination of the FO character heterozygosis can being similar to by genetic constitution.Wherein, after consequent
It is divided into the FO character plant of 1:1 and FO character heterozygosis for plant and there is the plant of wild type outward appearance.At this
It is believed that FO character is real breeding in the case of Zhong, character comes across background unified in heredity, root else if
According to Mendelian inheritance pattern, offspring's FO character aspect prediction difference. 
 Offspring represents the generation after crossing parental plants.After the offspring of the present invention can also be considered one group of plant
Generation. 
 The plant isozygotied to produce hereditism by number generation compatriot hybridization or self-pollination is selected, thus produces selfing
System.By upper for two kinds of hereditism different hybridization between selfed lines, collect the seed that hybridization produces, the seed then making generation
				
Germinate to produce hybrid plant, thus produce Hybrid.The hybrid seed produced in this way and plant, its
Form and the unification of physiological property.During this, produced hybrid seed, also benefits from hybrid vigor (hybrid
Advantage) effect. 
 The character only having female flower (FO) results from the normal or abiogenous sudden change of wild type Jatropha curcas plant.?
In the present invention, the Jatropha curcas plant comprising FO character has the female flower (stamen the is few) inflorescence without male flower, and wild
Type is the hermaphroditism inflorescence that male and female flowering separates in same inflorescence.The Cortex jatrophae plant of display FO characteristic can be effective
Male sterility and the parent can being used as during hybrid seed produces according to the present invention. 
 Transplanted or method for tissue culture by conventional, utilize clonal propagation can obtain hybrid seed and produce commonly required
The FO plant of considerable amount.Additionally use chain molecular marked compound, seed that optional FO character is isozygotied or
Seedling. 
 Inflorescence refers to the arrangement of flower on plants stems or axle.In the Jatropha curcas plant of known wild habit, inflorescence is formed at
Branch end, produces male flower and female flower simultaneously.In the FO Jatropha curcas of the present invention, inflorescence is formed at an end, and only produces
Raw female flower. 
 Interplanting refers to the system planting two or more crops or cultivar on same soil, is either mixed in
Together, or by row arrangement is alternately separated.According to the present invention, the two parent's cultivar is respectively to pass through asexual propagation
Single parent's gained.Interplanting system allows insecticide by the transport of the pollen of normal flower pattern to FO flower pattern, thus plants at FO
Produce Cortex jatrophae hybrid seed in strain, after germination, produce FO parental line and the hybrid plant of normal parents strain. 
 So the planting proportion of such as 1:2 can be used, although also can be with other interplanting configuration.As follows, will be single
Row's wild type selfing line or clonal derivation system plant on the limit of continuous two row FO Jatropha curcas clone varieties: 
 
 
 
 Consistent with the present invention, it be also possible to use different Plant plane and with the pollination of plant effectively and produce hybrid seed.
Other exemplary arrangement is respectively, and between a line FO and a line normal type alternately, three row FO and a line are normal
Between type alternately, FO and the interior wrong row alternately of normal type row. 
 Interplanting is a kind of efficient planting system hybridized, and only uses asexual propagation to produce the required soil of hybridization
				
A part.Such as, utilizing interplanting system according to the present invention, in per hectare 2,000 strain plant produces 6,000kg or
The production plot of 10 hectares (ha) of seed/hectare, the annual hybrid seed producing about 57000000 Cortex jatrophae.This
Sufficient seed will be had to plant 28,500 hectares of hybridization Cortex jatrophae.On the other hand, asexual propagation is passed through, it is assumed that every
Year every strain carries out 60 stems and transplants, then need 500 hectares to produce plot and produce 57000000 hybridization Cortex jatrophae cuttages. 
 Pollen exchange is that crossing pollination occurs, and causes wild type selfing Jatropha curcas plant to plant FO selfing Jatropha curcas
The process of strain insemination.Pollen exchange is generally carried out by insecticide, and pollen is carried to FO certainly by it from WT lines
Hand over plant. 
 It is normal or wild that the compounding power of improvement used herein refers to that the hybrid vigor produced and yield are higher than FO parent
The ability of type parent. 
 
 The generation of FO phenotype 
 
 FO Jatropha curcas plant can pass through the kind of international accession administrative organization (International Deposit Authority)
Sub-preservation is open to be obtained.Specifically, FO Jatropha curcas Seed Deposit is in being positioned at Manassas, Virginia 10801
American type culture collection (ATCC) (the American Culture Type of University Avenue 20110-2209
Collection), University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209).2500 pieces of FO Jatropha curcas
Seed is preserved in ATCC on the 30th in December in 2010, and gives ATCC Patent Deposit Designation PTA-11583.
As embodiment 3 describes in detail, the seed that can plant preservation has the Jatropha curcas plant of FO flower inflorescence with generation, and
The Jatropha curcas plant and the wild type Jatropha curcas plant that are produced performance FO character hybridize, recyclability ground and it is contemplated that
Property ground produce context of methods the Jatropha curcas hybrid seed including FO character. 
 Show that other collection of the Jatropha curcas available from wild environment also observes that FO is special with other group and exchanging of individual
Property.It will therefore be appreciated that FO characteristic exists in wild stocks, therefore can be obtained by the public. 
 
 The hereditary pattern of FO characteristic 
 
 FO plant and normal plant (wild-type inflorescences) hybridization produce two kinds of offspring's type, depend on male
The genotype of parent.First kind offspring is made up of the plant only producing normal inflorescence, and Equations of The Second Kind offspring is by with about 50-50
Ratio produce FO offspring and normal offspring mixing Progeny plants composition. 
 This FO character inheritance pattern is consistent with the hereditary pattern of recessive nuclearity shape, with FO allele and normally
Other normal plant that some normal plants of allele heterozygosis and normal allele isozygoty is consistent.Observe
The FO character of hereditary pattern and cytoplasmic male sterility type be consistent.In this case, FO type
Can lack core and recover allele, the nuclear restorer gene of some normal type is heterozygosis, and the core of other normal type
Restore gene is to isozygoty. 
 *********************** 
 The following example further illustrates foregoing invention.About these embodiments, produce being permitted of close or analog result
Many versions are it is clear that without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.Therefore, embodiment is not limiting as this
Bright. 
 
 
 The origin of embodiment 1FO character and the generation of hybrid seed 
 Achten etc., Biomass and Bioenergy 32:1063-84 (2008) describe Jatropha curcas cultivar
General cultivate and breeding method. 
 Shellfish in Guatemala steps on (Pet é n) and draws horse quina (La M á quina) to showing above-mentioned FO character
Jatropha curcas is cultivated.The purpose of breeding is to cultivate the Jatropha curcas hybrid plant that makes new advances, and its female flower increases, fruit and kind
Son amount increases and oil yield increases. 
 After inventor observed in 2009, choose and be grown on Guatemala shellfish and step on the calculated finger of controlled breeding improvement
It is set to the non-patent of " only female flower ", the Jatropha curcas of proprietary login (proprietary accession).Inventor's base
Herb Catastrophic selection in wild type Jatropha curcas goes out the Cortex jatrophae of " only opening female flower ".Specifically, " female flower is only opened "
Produce the inflorescence only having female flower (few stamen), therefore, there is no any male flower. 
 The only female flower of Jatropha curcas plant produces fruit and seed.Therefore, the Female Flower Number of each inflorescence and follow-up every
The fruit peplos of female flower generation and number seeds affect the potential oil production of each Jatropha curcas plant.Inventor recognizes
To using " only open female flower " FO Jatropha curcas from this usually hermaphrodite species, efficiently producing cenospecies
Potentiality in the Breeding Process of son. 
 
 
 The generation of embodiment 2FO hybrid seed 
 The method that hybrid crop and seed produce see U.S. Patent number 4,326,358,4,527,352,4,627,192,
4,686,319 and 6,018,101, and disclosed U.S. Application No. 2008-0098492.Disclosed in these patents
Content is totally incorporated herein by reference respectively. 
 Hybrid produces the female strain needing not have male gamete to produce.In some cases, carry out emasculation and make plant
Lack pollen, be therefore female.The another kind of method setting up the female strain producing hybrid seed is to identify to produce
The strain of liveliness proof pollen. 
 The FO character of the Cortex jatrophae being appointed as the selected proprietary login of " only opening female flower " is used for creating production cenospecies
The female strain of son, because " only opening female flower " only produces female flower, the most any male flower.Jatropha curcas " only opens female flower "
FO character allow by only open the selfing line of female flower with there is wild type bloom and with the strain only opening female flower
The Jatropha curcas selfing line interplanting of the genetic background of compounding power improvement produces hybrid seed. 
 Produce the plot of hybrid seed, such as, by the planting proportion of 1:2, can there is no other to a great extent
A line wild type Jatropha curcas selfing line is planted in two row FO Jatropha curcas selfing line plant by the region of Jatropha curcas plant
Bian Shang, so that the pollen that the insecticide of pollination FO strain only obtained and carried wild type Jatropha curcas selfing line arrives
FO Jatropha curcas strain, thus produce hybridization F1 seed.Distance 3 meters between every a line, between each plant
Distance 2 meters, but may be used without other suitable planting density.Only gather in the crops fruit from the selfing line only opening female flower (FO)
Real, the seed obtained from FO strain is F1 hybrid seed.The Jatropha curcas plant that the F1 hybrid seed of results produces
Show normally bloom, raising vigor, fruit and seed amount increase and oil yield increases.Also can be from wild
The male strain of type is collected fruit and is carried out oil processing. 
 Seed produces by 6000 kg/ha/in terms of year, and the production plot of 10 hectares will produce 60000 kilograms of seeds,
Wherein 40000 kilograms is F1 hybrid seed, because the FO type of per hectare accounts for the plant of 2/3.Average seed
Weight in terms of about 0.7 gram/seed, then produces about 57000000 pieces of seeds, if or as it has been described above, per hectare hybrid is close
Degree is 2000 strain hybrids, and gained seed then be enough to use selected FO Jatropha curcas plant to be planted on 28500 hectares
Plantation F1 hybrid.Use selected FO Jatropha curcas strain and wild type Jatropha curcas strain with the F1 seed that hybridizes
Interplanting process have superiority, therefore, spent by this process labour force and cost of land be by asexual numerous
Grow a part for the F1 hybrid producing clonal derivation.It also reduces the cost that hybrid plant is transported to new plantation.
The cost of transportation that the cost of seed transport is transplanted far below the clonal derivation of hybrid.With collection and transport hybrid seed phase
Ratio, carries out hybrid clone breeding more expensive by transplanting, and transport is the most more expensive to expection client. 
 
 
 Embodiment 3 International Depository Authority carries out Seed Deposit 
 Jatropha curcas Seed Deposit containing FO character is in being positioned at Manassas, Virginia 10801 University Avenue
The American type culture collection (American Culture Type Collection) of 20110-2209
(ATCC), University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209).2500 pieces of fiber crops containing FO character
Wind seeds is preserved in ATCC on the 30th in December in 2010, and gives ATCC Patent Deposit Designation
PTA-11583.The seed that can plant preservation has the Jatropha curcas plant of FO flower inflorescence with generation, and with being produced
The Jatropha curcas plant of raw performance FO character and the hybridization of wild type Jatropha curcas plant, recyclability is the most predictable
Produce the Jatropha curcas hybrid seed containing FO character of methods described herein. 
 
 
 The heredity choosing of embodiment 4FO character characterizes 
 In February, 2009, Guatemala shellfish step on by asexual transplant the Jatropha curcas containing FO character is selected into
Row asexual propagation.The assessment of First Year shows that FO character is fixed and retains in the asexual propagation first generation, and in nothing
Also should result in the continuous offspring of sexual reproduction. 
 In November, 2009 steps on Guatemala shellfish and draws between the breeding experiment of horse quina, it was observed that given Jatropha curcas
Log in the percentage ratio of FO type in family and have good concordance, support FO character be by heredity rather than environment because of
Usually control.The number only opening female flower type in logging in family is of about 1/4 or 1/2, and this shows the spy of FO character
Point is probably natural recessiveness.The seed that the autologous pollination of the wild type Jatropha curcas flower of FO character heterozygosis produces may go out
Existing 1/4 separation, the Jatropha curcas flower only opening female flower receives the pollen institute that the wild type Cortex jatrophae of adjacent FO character heterozygosis is spent
The seed produced is likely to occur 1/2 separation. 
 What the genetic base no matter controlling FO character in Jatropha curcas is, these data show that FO character can weigh
Penetrate in the middle of Jatropha curcas genetic background again and predictably and can keep stablizing by asexual propagation. 
 
 
 Embodiment 5 shows the sign of the Jatropha curcas of FO character 
 FO type Jatropha curcas and normal Jatropha curcas plant strain growth are under same place and same environmental conditions. 
 The jatropha curcas seed of open pollination first germinates under usual greenhouse experiment, when seedling (having bud) is long to about 8-10
Its growth of inch limit.Then Jatropha curcas seedling cultivation is covered the danger ground horse under Weeds distribution in drip irrigation and plastics
In soil, La Beideng nursery. 
 First the seedling of the open pollination of about 6000 strain Cortex jatrophae will be pacified in Guatemala at the beginning of the end of the year 2008 and 2009
Carry melon (Antigua) nursery to plant, be transplanted on the soil that Guatemala shellfish steps in May, 2009 subsequently.
Jatropha curcas plant is carried out screening system there is with qualification the character of potential value, in this population, identify FO
Shape, its unique distinction is that all flowers are female flower. 
 
 
 Embodiment 6 is the exemplary use of FO character in other Jatropha curcas kind 
 FO Jatropha curcas plant in the present invention can the same with other Jatropha curcas plant be used for producing bio-fuel or work
For hedge.But, FO character makes Jatropha curcas plant of the present invention be especially better than wild type Jatropha curcas plant.Such as,
FO character can efficiently produce F1 hybrid seed, and its labour force expended and cost of land sprout for producing and transporting
A part for vegetative F1 hybrid plant.Additionally, with stem transplant gained hybrid plant conversely, because be from
The F1 hybrid seed growth of results, the F1 hybrid plant that interplanting produces has more preferable root growth. 
 
 
 FO character is introduced other Jatropha curcas kind by embodiment 7 
 By traditional breeding method, the Morphological and physiological characteristics of Jatropha curcas plant in the present invention can be included FO character
Introduce other Jatropha curcas kind. 
 Such as, make the FO Jatropha curcas plant strain growth pollination close with another wild type Jatropha curcas kind of the present invention, this
Sample makes to carry out between FO type and wild type artificial crossing pollination, then gathers in the crops hybrid seed.Grow miscellaneous from these
The plant handing over seed can estimate the reservation of screening/monitoring FO character, or autologous pollination, then screens F2 offspring's
				
FO character, and from wild type Jatropha curcas other needed for character. 
 Therefore according to the present invention, plant clone (often row 12-15 strain plant) of FO character is carried and as pollen
The alternately plantation of the normal plants (often row 12-15 strain plant) in source, thus the fruit of normal amount is produced by entomophila hybridization
Reality and hybrid seed.Additionally, the planting density of FO plant is different, to the every a line normal plant as pollen source
Plant two row FO clones.In all cases, the total seed yield of the clone of every 7 months big FO is (average
Every 25 pieces of fruits of strain plant, raw 3,703 seeds of common property) it is similar to or exceedes in the manual pollination of areal same year
7 months big FO clone the seed obtained. 
 These results indicate that the feature of FO can be used for mixing with male combination carrying out implant mass, pass through entomophila
Hybridization produces hybrid seed.By this method, the seed that the present invention collects from the plant of FO row is hybrid seed.
According to the present invention, available often combine male greater proportion FO plant (i.e. 3 row FO//1 row normal plant or
4 row FO//1 row normal plant), at the generation hybrid seed that unit area is more efficient. 
 ************************
