 The present invention relates to conjugates comprising pyrrolobenzodiazepines and related dimers (PBDs), and the precursor drug linkers used to make such conjugates. 
 BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION 
 Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al.,  Chem. Rev.  1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al.,  Chem. Brit.,  26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al.,  Tetrahedron,  48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al,  J. Antibiotics,  29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston,  J. Org. Chem.,  52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al.,  J. Antibiotics,  25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure: 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N═C), a carbinolamine (NH—CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH—CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In  Antibiotics III . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDeventer,  Acc. Chem. Res.,  19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents. 
 It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of this molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8/C′-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al.,  J. Org. Chem.,  61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5′-Pu-GATC-Py-3′ interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al.,  Biochemistry,  42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al.,  Biochemistry,  44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity. 
 One example of a PBD dimer is SG2000 (SJG-136): 
                     
(Gregson, S., et al.,  J. Med. Chem.,  44, 737-748 (2001); Alley, M. C., et al.,  Cancer Research,  64, 6700-6706 (2004); Hartley, J. A., et al.,  Cancer Research,  64, 6693-6699 (2004)) which has been involved in clinical trials as a standalone agent, for example, NCT02034227 investigating its use in treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (see: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02034227).
 
 Dimeric PBD compounds bearing C2 aryl substituents, such as SG2202 (ZC-207), are disclosed in WO 2005/085251: 
                     
and in WO2006/111759, bisulphites of such PBD compounds, for example SG2285 (ZC-423):
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 These compounds have been shown to be highly useful cytotoxic agents (Howard, P. W., et al.,  Bioorg. Med. Chem . (2009), doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.09.012). 
 WO 2007/085930 describes the preparation of dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody. The linker is present in the bridge linking the monomer PBD units of the dimer. 
 Dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent, such as an antibody, are described in WO 2011/130598. The linker in these compounds is attached to one of the available N10 positions, and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group. If the non-bound N10 position is protected with a capping group, the capping groups exemplified have the same cleavage trigger as the linker to the antibody. 
 WO 2014/057074 describes two specific PBD dimer conjugates bound via the N10 position on one monomer, the other PBD monomer being in imine form. 
 WO 2015/052322 describes a specific PBD dimer conjugate bound via the N10 position on one monomer, the other PBD monomer being in imine form. It also describes a specific PBD dimer conjugate bound via the N10 position on one monomer, the other PBD monomer having a capping group with the same cleavage trigger as the linker to the antibody: 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 
 The present invention provides PBD and related dimer conjugates where the N10-C11 group that is not bound to the ligand unit is a β-glucuronide capping group. The cleavage trigger for the linking unit to the ligand unit is non-glucuronide cleavable. 
 Use of the glucuronide capping unit in these conjugates is believed to be advantageous, as if the conjugate is cleaved from the antibody outside the target cell, the released protected compound remains inactive as it is unable to permeate cell membranes due to its hydrophilicity. 
 The present invention also provided PBD and related dimer drug linkers, suitable for conjugating to a ligand unit, where the N10-C11 group that is not intended to be bound to the ligand unit is a glucuronide capping group. The cleavage trigger for the linking unit is a non-glucuronide capping unit. 
 Use of the glucuronide capping unit in these drug linkers is believed to be advantageous, as it increases the hydrophilicity of the generally hydrophobic drug linker, making the drug linkers easier to conjugate to a ligand unit.

 Ligand Unit 
 The Ligand Unit may be of any kind, and include a protein, polypeptide, peptide and a non-peptidic agent that specifically binds to a target molecule. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit may be a cyclic polypeptide. These Ligand units can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one target molecule-binding site, lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, or any other cell binding molecule or substance that can specifically bind to a target. 
 The terms “specifically binds” and “specific binding” refer to the binding of an antibody or other protein, polypeptide or peptide to a predetermined molecule (e.g., an antigen). 
 Typically, the antibody or other molecule binds with an affinity of at least about 1×10 7  M −1 , and binds to the predetermined molecule with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific molecule (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined molecule or a closely-related molecule. 
 Examples of Ligand units include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein. 
 In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a Cell Binding Agent that binds to an extracellular target on a cell. Such a Cell Binding Agent can be a protein, polypeptide, peptide or a non-peptidic agent. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a protein, polypeptide or peptide. In some embodiments, the Cell Binding Agent may be a cyclic polypeptide. The Cell Binding Agent also may be antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). 
 Cell Binding Agent 
 A cell binding agent may be of any kind, and include peptides and non-peptides. These can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one binding site, lymphokines, hormones, hormone mimetics, vitamins, growth factors, nutrient-transport molecules, or any other cell binding molecule or substance. 
 Peptides 
 In one embodiment, the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4-30, preferably 6-20, contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment, it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound. 
 In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin α v β 6 . The peptide may be selective for α v β 6  over XYS. 
 In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV-Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV-Cys has the sequence: NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC. Alternatively, a variant of the A20FMDV-Cys sequence may be used wherein one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten amino acid residues are substituted with another amino acid residue. Furthermore, the polypeptide may have the sequence NAVXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXRTC. 
 Antibodies 
 The term “antibody” herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, dimers, multimers, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Miller et al (2003)  Jour. of Immunology  170:4854-4861). Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001)  Immuno Biology,  5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species, including human, murine, or rabbit origin. 
 “Antibody fragments” comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′) 2 , and scFv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. 
 The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975)  Nature  256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991)  Nature,  352:624-628; Marks et al (1991)  J. Mol. Biol.,  222:581-597 or from transgenic mice carrying a fully human immunoglobulin system (Lonberg (2008)  Curr. Opinion  20(4):450-459). 
 The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984)  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies include “primatized” antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape) and human constant region sequences. 
 An “intact antibody” herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g. human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more “effector functions” which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR. 
 Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different “classes.” There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into “subclasses” (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. 
 Humanisation 
 Techniques to reduce the in vivo immunogenicity of a non-human antibody or antibody fragment include those termed “humanisation”. 
 A “humanized antibody” refers to a polypeptide comprising at least a portion of a modified variable region of a human antibody wherein a portion of the variable region, preferably a portion substantially less than the intact human variable domain, has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species and wherein the modified variable region is linked to at least another part of another protein, preferably the constant region of a human antibody. The expression “humanized antibodies” includes human antibodies in which one or more complementarity determining region (“CDR”) amino acid residues and/or one or more framework region (“FW” or “FR”) amino acid residues are substituted by amino acid residues from analogous sites in rodent or other non-human antibodies. The expression “humanized antibody” also includes an immunoglobulin amino acid sequence variant or fragment thereof that comprises an FR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human immunoglobulin. 
 “Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Or, looked at another way, a humanized antibody is a human antibody that also contains selected sequences from non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies in place of the human sequences. A humanized antibody can include conservative amino acid substitutions or non-natural residues from the same or different species that do not significantly alter its binding and/or biologic activity. Such antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulins. 
 There are a range of humanisation techniques, including ‘CDR grafting’, ‘guided selection’, ‘deimmunization’, ‘resurfacing’ (also known as ‘veneering’), ‘composite antibodies’, ‘Human String Content Optimisation’ and framework shuffling. 
 CDR Grafting 
 In this technique, the humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient antibody are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, camel, bovine, goat, or rabbit having the desired properties (in effect, the non-human CDRs are ‘grafted’ onto the human framework). In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues (this may happen when, for example, a particular FR residue has significant effect on antigen binding). 
 Furthermore, humanized antibodies can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and maximize antibody performance. Thus, in general, a humanized antibody will comprise all of at least one, and in one aspect two, variable domains, in which all or all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), or that of a human immunoglobulin. 
 Guided Selection 
 The method consists of combining the V H  or V L  domain of a given non-human antibody specific for a particular epitope with a human V H  or V L  library and specific human V domains are selected against the antigen of interest. This selected human VH is then combined with a VL library to generate a completely human VH×VL combination. The method is described in Nature Biotechnology (N.Y.) 12, (1994) 899-903. 
 Composite Antibodies 
 In this method, two or more segments of amino acid sequence from a human antibody are combined within the final antibody molecule. They are constructed by combining multiple human VH and VL sequence segments in combinations which limit or avoid human T cell epitopes in the final composite antibody V regions. Where required, T cell epitopes are limited or avoided by, exchanging V region segments contributing to or encoding a T cell epitope with alternative segments which avoid T cell epitopes. This method is described in US 2008/0206239 A1. 
 Deimmunization 
 This method involves the removal of human (or other second species) T-cell epitopes from the V regions of the therapeutic antibody (or other molecule). The therapeutic antibodies V-region sequence is analysed for the presence of MHC class II-binding motifs by, for example, comparison with databases of MHC-binding motifs (such as the “motifs” database hosted at www.wehi.edu.au). Alternatively, MHC class II-binding motifs may be identified using computational threading methods such as those devised by Altuvia et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 249 244-250 (1995)); in these methods, consecutive overlapping peptides from the V-region sequences are testing for their binding energies to MHC class II proteins. This data can then be combined with information on other sequence features which relate to successfully presented peptides, such as amphipathicity, Rothbard motifs, and cleavage sites for cathepsin B and other processing enzymes. 
 Once potential second species (e.g. human) T-cell epitopes have been identified, they are eliminated by the alteration of one or more amino acids. The modified amino acids are usually within the T-cell epitope itself, but may also be adjacent to the epitope in terms of the primary or secondary structure of the protein (and therefore, may not be adjacent in the primary structure). Most typically, the alteration is by way of substitution but, in some circumstances amino acid addition or deletion will be more appropriate. 
 All alterations can be accomplished by recombinant DNA technology, so that the final molecule may be prepared by expression from a recombinant host using well established methods such as Site Directed Mutagenesis. However, the use of protein chemistry or any other means of molecular alteration is also possible. 
 Resurfacing 
 This method involves:
         (a) determining the conformational structure of the variable region of the non-human (e.g. rodent) antibody (or fragment thereof) by constructing a three-dimensional model of the non-human antibody variable region;   (b) generating sequence alignments using relative accessibility distributions from x-ray crystallographic structures of a sufficient number of non-human and human antibody variable region heavy and light chains to give a set of heavy and light chain framework positions wherein the alignment positions are identical in 98% of the sufficient number of non-human antibody heavy and light chains;   (c) defining for the non-human antibody to be humanized, a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues using the set of framework positions generated in step (b);   (d) identifying from human antibody amino acid sequences a set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues that is most closely identical to the set of surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c), wherein the heavy and light chain from the human antibody are or are not naturally paired;   (e) substituting, in the amino acid sequence of the non-human antibody to be humanized, the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues defined in step (c) with the set of heavy and light chain surface exposed amino acid residues identified in step (d);   (f) constructing a three-dimensional model of the variable region of the non-human antibody resulting from the substituting specified in step (e);   (g) identifying, by comparing the three-dimensional models constructed in steps (a) and (f), any amino acid residues from the sets identified in steps (c) or (d), that are within 5 Angstroms of any atom of any residue of the complementarity determining regions of the non-human antibody to be humanized; and   (h) changing any residues identified in step (g) from the human to the original non-human amino acid residue to thereby define a non-human antibody humanizing set of surface exposed amino acid residues; with the proviso that step (a) need not be conducted first, but must be conducted prior to step (g).
 
Superhumanization
       
 The method compares the non-human sequence with the functional human germline gene repertoire. Those human genes encoding canonical structures identical or closely related to the non-human sequences are selected. Those selected human genes with highest homology within the CDRs are chosen as FR donors. Finally, the non-human CDRs are grafted onto these human FRs. This method is described in patent WO 2005/079479 A2. 
 Human String Content Optimization 
 This method compares the non-human (e.g. mouse) sequence with the repertoire of human germline genes and the differences are scored as Human String Content (HSC) that quantifies a sequence at the level of potential MHC/T-cell epitopes. The target sequence is then humanized by maximizing its HSC rather than using a global identity measure to generate multiple diverse humanized variants (described in Molecular Immunology, 44, (2007) 1986-1998). 
 Framework Shuffling 
 The CDRs of the non-human antibody are fused in-frame to cDNA pools encompassing all known heavy and light chain human germline gene frameworks. Humanised antibodies are then selected by e.g. panning of the phage displayed antibody library. This is described in    Methods   36, 43-60 (2005). 
 Examples of cell binding agents include those agents described for use in WO 2007/085930, which is incorporated herein.

 The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin-binding peptide (ABP) sequence (Dennis et al. (2002) “Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins”  J Biol Chem.  277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746). Antibodies of the invention include fusion proteins with ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002)  J Biol Chem.  277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; (ii) US 2004/0001827 at [0076]; and (iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, and all of which are incorporated herein by reference. 
 In one embodiment, the antibody has been raised to target specific the tumour related antigen α v β 6 . 
 The cell binding agent may be labelled, for example to aid detection or purification of the agent either prior to incorporation as a conjugate, or as part of the conjugate. The label may be a biotin label. In another embodiment, the cell binding agent may be labelled with a radioisotope. 
 Connection of Linker Unit to Ligand Unit 
 The Ligand unit is connected to the Linker unit through a disulfide bond. 
 In one embodiment, the connection between the Ligand unit and the Drug Linker is formed between a thiol group of a cysteine residue of the Ligand unit and a maleimide group of the Drug Linker unit. 
 The cysteine residues of the Ligand unit may be available for reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit to form a connection. In other embodiments, for example where the Ligand unit is an antibody, the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit. 
 In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is an introduced into the heavy or light chain of an antibody. Positions for cysteine insertion by substitution in antibody heavy or light chains include those described in Published U.S. Application No. 2007-0092940 and International Patent Publication WO2008070593, which are incorporated herein. 
 Methods of Treatment 
 The compounds of the present invention may be used in a method of therapy. Also provided is a method of treatment, comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a conjugate of formula II. The term “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors. 
 A conjugate may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Examples of treatments and therapies include, but are not limited to, chemotherapy (the administration of active agents, including, e.g. drugs; surgery; and radiation therapy. 
 Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, i.e. a conjugate of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. cutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous. 
 Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included.

 Drug Loading 
 The drug loading (p) is the average number of PBD drugs per cell binding agent, e.g. antibody. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to cysteines, drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, i.e. where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the cell binding agent. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 8. Where the compounds of the invention are bound to lysines, drug loading may range from 1 to 80 drugs (D) per cell binding agent, although an upper limit of 40, 20, 10 or 8 may be preferred. Compositions of conjugates include collections of cell binding agents, e.g. antibodies, conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 80, 1 to 40, 1 to 20, 1 to 10 or 1 to 8. 
 The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV, reverse phase HPLC, 
 HIC, mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and electrophoresis. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA, the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined (Hamblett et al (2004) Clin. Cancer Res. 10:7063-7070; Sanderson et al (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11:843-852). However, the distribution of p (drug) values is not discernible by the antibody-antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also, ELISA assay for detection of antibody-drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody, such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments, or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis. Such techniques are also applicable to other types of conjugates. 
 For some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. 
 Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the Drug Linker. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TCEP, under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of Drug Linker relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification. 
 Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by engineering one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids. 
 Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages (Junutula, et al., 2008b Nature Biotech., 26(8):925-932; Dornan et al (2009) Blood 114(13):2721-2729; U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,521,541; 7,723,485; WO2009/052249). The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug-linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol-reactive, electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha-halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed, controlled, and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol-reactive linker reagents or drug-linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved with near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC. 
 Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase (PLRP) and hydrophobic interaction (HIC) may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value (p) may be isolated, however, these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached, via the linker, at different sites on the antibody. 
 Thus the antibody-drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody-drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues. 
 In one embodiment, the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8, 2 to 8, 2 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8. 
 In some embodiments, there is one dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine group per cell binding agent. 
 General Synthetic Routes 
 The synthesis of PBD compounds is extensively discussed in the following references, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference: 
 a) WO 00/12508 (pages 14 to 30); 
 b) WO 2005/023814 (pages 3 to 10); 
 c) WO 2004/043963 ( pages  28 to 29); and 
 d) WO 2005/085251 ( pages  30 to 39). 
 Synthesis Route 
 Compounds of the present invention of formula I: 
                     
can be synthesised from a compound of Formula II:
 
                     
where R 2 , R 6 , R 7 , R 9 , R 6′ , R 7′ , R 9′ , R 11b , R 12 , Y, Y′ and R″ are as defined for compounds of formula I, and R LL  is a precursor of R L —this method is particularly applicable to compounds of formula I where R L  is of formula IIIa. For these compounds, R LL  will typically be a portion of R L , such as a group of formula IIIa′:
 
                     
In such as case, the reaction involves adding the group G.
 
 The compounds of Formula 2 may be made by deprotecting compounds of Formula 3: 
                     
where R 2 , R 6 , R 7 , R 9 , R 6′ , R 7′ , R 9′ , R 11b , R 12 , Y, Y′ and R″ are as defined for compounds of formula I, R LL-Prot  is a protected version of R LL , and the Prot represents an appropriate carboxy/hydroxy protecting group.
 
 Compounds of formula 3 may be made by ring-closure of compounds of Formula 4: 
                     
where the ring closure is carried out by oxidation, e.g. Swern.
 
 Compounds of formula 4 can be synthesised from compounds of formula 5: 
                     
by step-wise addition of the two amino protecting groups. Step-wise addition can be achieved by simple protection of one amino group (e.g. by Fmoc), followed by installation of a desired protecting group at the other amino group. This can be followed by removal of the simple protecting group, and then installation of the other desired amino protecting group.
 
 Compounds of formula I where R L  is of formula IIIb, may be synthesised in a similar manner, although the complete R L  group may be installed starting from a compound of Formula 5, rather than with the use of a protected precursor. 
 Compounds of Formula 5 can be synthesised by known methods, such as those disclosed in WO 2011/130598. 
 Synthesis of Drug Conjugates 
 Conjugates can be prepared as previously described. Antibodies can be conjugated to the Drug Linker compound as described in Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2003, 21, 778-784). Briefly, antibodies (4-5 mg/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37° C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, is monitored by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols/mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0° C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol. After 1 hour, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC is then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation, and RP-HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker.

These groups may be bound to the rest of the PBD moiety via the nitrogen atom. These groups may be further substituted, for example, by C 1-4  alkyl groups. If the C 6  nitrogen containing heterocyclyl group is piperazinyl, the said further substituent may be on the second nitrogen ring atom.

Additional Background
 
 In an impact study submitted to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the United Kingdom by University College London (available at http://impactref.ac.uk/casestudies2/refservice.svc/GetCaseStudyPDF/35393), it was commented that: 
 “The next generation of PBD dimers, which are more potent than SG2000, have been developed, including SG2057 and SG2202. They exhibit picomolar/sub-picomolar activity against a range of human tumour cell lines and demonstrate curative activity in human tumour xenograft models.” making reference to: 
 Hartley J A, et al.,  DNA interstrand cross - linking and in vivo antitumor activity of the extended pyrrolo [2,1- c ][1,4]benzodiazepine dimer SG2057. Invest New Drugs. 2012 June; 30(3):950-8. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10637-011-9647-z (herein after “Hartley et al (2012)”) and: 
 “The ability to generate such cytotoxic molecules that display exquisite potency suggested a potential role in strategies aimed at targeting and releasing highly cytotoxic agents directly at a tumour site. An example is as the ‘warhead’ component of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The fully synthetic PBD dimers are ideally suited for the role of warhead in an ADC approach.” 
 The Hartley et al (2012) paper comments in its summary that “SG2057 is therefore a highly active antitumour agent, with more potent in vitro activity and superior in vivo activity to SG2000, warranting further development”. 
 SG2057 has the structure: 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 Antibody drug conjugates using SG2057 as a warhead were first disclosed in WO 2011/130598. For example, claim 54 of this application includes the formula: 
                     
wherein n is from 1 to 24, more preferably 4 to 8. The following drug linkers were exemplified: n=4, 15c; n=8, 15d; n=24, 15e.
 
 Claim 54 of this application also includes the formula: 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 wherein n is from 1 to 24, more preferably 4 to 8. The following drug linkers were exemplified: n=8, 58; n=24, 61. 
 WO 2011/130598 also discloses antibody-drug conjugates including these drug linkers, for example 110 (antiSteap1-15d), example 114 (tastuzumab-15d) and example 115 (tastuzumab-58). 
 WO 2013/055987 discloses the drug linkers 14 and 22: 
                     
and their use in antibody-drug conjugates.
 
 More recently, the warhead: 
                     
has been used in drug linkers and antibody-drug conjugates. WO 2014/057074 discloses:
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 The present inventors have surprisingly found that although SG2000 is at least 10 times less cytotoxic than SG2057 (see Hartley et al 2012), particular antibody-drug conjugates, i.e. those of formula Id, appear to show at least comparable activity. These conjugates have been shown to have surprisingly well tolerated in toxicity studies in a variety of species. This leads to the conjugates exhibiting high therapeutic indices and thus are promising clinical candidates. 
 In some embodiments of the present invention, the C11 substituent may be in the following stereochemical arrangement relative to neighbouring groups:

 In Vitro Testing of  Compound  10 
 DU145 (2000/well, 72 hour assay) and MDA-MB-361 (5000/well, 144 hour assay) cells were plated in culture medium to tissue culture-treated 96-well plates at a volume of 80 μL per well and allowed to adhere overnight. For warhead dilutions, first a 60× concentration of each dose to be tested was prepared by diluting the test articles in DMSO. The 60× dilutions of warhead were then further diluted to a 5× concentration in either cell culture medium alone or cell culture medium containing 5× β-glucuronidase enzyme (Sigma Cat # G0799-25KU). 20 μL of cell culture medium containing test article+/−enzyme was added to cells in triplicate wells, and the final dose curve ranged from 6.4 nM to 61 pM in a stepwise 1:4 serial dilution series. DMSO alone diluted to the culture medium was used as the controls. The treated cells were cultured at 37° C./5% CO 2  for 72 to 144 hours (depending on established growth kinetics of each particular cell line). At the end of the assay, CellTiter-Glo® (CTG) Luminescent Viability Assay (Promega) was used to determine relative cytotoxicity. 100 μL of CTG reagent was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking, absorbance of each sample was read at 560 nM using an EnVision luminometer (Perkin Elmer). The percent cell viability was calculated by the following formula:

Testing of ConjB and ConjC in Cells with siRNA Knock Down of β-Glucuronidase
 
 HER2-overexpressing SKOV3 cells were subjected to reverse transfection to knock down GUSB expression levels. First, a 4× stock of RNAiMAX (final concentration of 0.125 ul/well, Life Technologies) and a 4× stock of siRNA oligos (Non-targeting/Negative siRNA, GAPDH siRNA and GUSB siRNA final concentration of 100 nM/well, Life Technologies) were prepared in OptiMEM medium. An RNAiMAX/OptiMEM only mixture was included as the lipid control. The 4× RNAiMAX solution and 4× siRNA solutions were brought to 2× by mixing in a one to one ratio, and the RNAiMAX/siRNA mixture was left to incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes. After incubation, 40 μl of the RNAiMAX/siRNA mixtures and lipid control were added per well to tissue culture-treated 96-well plates and 40 μl of cell solution was added onto the lipid/siRNA mixture, with a final plating density of 2000 cells/well. Plates were cultured at 37° C./5% CO 2  for 72 hours at which  point  20 μl of a 5× concentration of each dose of ConjB/ConjC was added to the cells in duplicate wells with a final dose curve ranging from 10 μg/mL to 0.15 ng/mL in a 1:4 serial dilution series. The ADC treated cells were cultured at 37° C./5% CO 2  for an additional 72 hours and the CellTiter-Glo® (CTG) Luminescent Viability Assay (Promega) was used to determine relative cytotoxicity as described above. Efficiency of the siRNA knock down was determined by RNA expression levels and measurement of β-glucuronidase enzyme activity.

 Example 10—In Vitro Testing 
 Medium from sub-confluent (80-90% confluency) cell culture in a T75 flask was aspirated and the flask rinsed with PBS (about 20 ml) and emptied. Trypsin-EDTA (5 ml) was added, the flask returned to the 37° C. gassed incubator for up to about 5 minutes, then rapped sharply to dislodge and dissociate cells from the plastic. The cell suspension was transferred to a sterile 50 ml screw-top centrifuge tube, diluted with growth medium to a final volume of 15 ml, then centrifuged (400 g for 5 min). The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet re-suspended in 10 ml culture medium. Repeated pipetting may be necessary to produce monodisperse cell suspensions. The cell concentration and viability are measured of trypan blue cell stained cells, and counted using the LUNA-11™ Automated Cell Counter. Cells were diluted to 2×10 5 /ml, dispensed (50 μl/well) into 96 well flat bottom plates and incubated overnight before use. 
 A stock solution (1 ml) of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) (20 μg/ml) was made by dilution of filter-sterilised ADC into cell culture medium. A set of 8×10-fold dilutions of stock ADC were made in a 24 well plate by serial transfer of 100 μl onto 900 μl of cell culture medium. 
 ADC dilution was dispensed (50 μl/well) into 4 replicate wells of the 96-well plate, containing 50 μl cell suspension seeded the previous day. Control wells received 50 μl cell culture medium. The 96-well plate containing cells and ADCs was incubated at 37° C. in a CO 2 -gassed incubator for the exposure time. 
 At the end of the incubation period, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. MTS (Promega) was dispensed (20 μl per well) into each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37° C. in the CO 2 -gassed incubator. Well absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Percentage cell survival was calculated from the mean absorbance in the 4 ADC-treated wells compared to the mean absorbance in the 4 control untreated wells (100%). IC 50  was determined from the doses-response data using Graph Pad Prism using the non-linear curve fit algorithm: sigmoidal, 4PL X is log(concentration).

 Example 11—Xenograft Testing 
 NCI-N87 Xenografted Mice 
 Female severe combined immune-deficient mice (Fox Chase SCID®, C.B-17/Icr-Prkdcscid, Charles River) were ten weeks old with a body weight (BW) range of 16.5 to 21.1 grams on Day 1 of the study. The animals were fed ad libitum water (reverse osmosis, 1 ppm Cl), and NIH 31 Modified and Irradiated Lab Diet® consisting of 18.0% crude protein, 5.0% crude fat, and 5.0% crude fibre. The mice were housed on irradiated Enricho'cobs™ Laboratory Animal Bedding in static micro-isolators on a 12-hour light cycle at 20-22° C. (68-72° F.) and 40-60% humidity. CR Discovery Services specifically complies with the recommendations of the  Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  with respect to restraint, husbandry, surgical procedures, feed and fluid regulation, and veterinary care. The animal care and use program at CR Discovery Services is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC), which assures compliance with accepted standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. 
 Tumour Cell Culture 
 Human NCI-N87 gastric carcinoma lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate and 25 μg/mL gentamicin. The cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in a humidified incubator at 37° C., in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2  and 95% air. 
 In Vivo Implantation and Tumour Growth 
 The NCI-N87 cells used for implantation were harvested during log phase growth and Re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 50% Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences). On the day of tumour implant, each test mouse was injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 1×10 7  cells (0.1 mL cell suspension), and tumour growth was monitored as the average size approached the target range of 100 to 150 mm 3 . Fourteen days later, designated as Day 1 of the study, mice were sorted according to calculated tumour size into groups each consisting of ten animals with individual tumour volumes ranging from 108 to 144 mm 3  and group mean tumour volumes of 115 mm 3 . 
 Tumours were measured in two dimensions using calipers, and volume was calculated using the formula: 
           Tumour   ⁢           ⁢   Volume   ⁢           ⁢     (     mm   3     )       =         w   2     ⁢   xl     2           
where w=width and 1=length, in mm, of the tumour. Tumour weight may be estimated with the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm 3  of tumour volume.
 
Treatment
 
 Treatment began on Day 1 in groups of 10 mice (n=10) with established subcutaneous NCI-N87 tumours (108-144 mm 3 ). Trastuzumab-10 (ConjA) was administered intravenously once on Day 1 (qd×1). A vehicle-treated group served as the control group for efficacy analysis. Tumours were measured twice per week until the study was ended on Day 79. Each mouse was euthanized when its tumour reached the endpoint volume of 800 mm 3  or on the final day, whichever came first. The time to endpoint (TTE) was calculated for each mouse. 
 Treatment outcome was determined from percent tumour growth delay (% TGD), defined as the percent increase in median TTE for treated versus control mice, with differences between groups deemed statistically significant at P≤0.05 using logrank survival analysis. Mice were monitored for complete regression (CR) and partial regression (PR) responses. 
 Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. All regimens were well tolerated. The median TTE for vehicle-treated controls was 50.7 days, establishing a maximum possible TGD of 28.3 days (56%) for the 79-day study. 
 The minimum effective dose was defined as the minimum dosage required to produce tumour stasis for twenty-eight days after test article administration. Based on visual inspection of the mean and median tumour volume plots and percent change of tumour volume from Day 1, trastuzumab-10 (ConjA) at 1.0 mg/kg, appeared to be the dosage that achieved a response consistent with the minimum effective dose 
 Two of the 0.3 mg/kg group animals were end of study survivors with an MTV of 708 mm 3 . Eight of the 1.0 mg/kg group animals were end of study survivors with an MTV of 650 mm 3 . The results are illustrated in  FIG. 3 . 
 JIMT-1 Xenografted Mice 
 Mice 
 Female severe combined immunodeficient mice (Fox Chase SCID®, CB17/Icr-Prkdcscid/IcrIcoCrl, Charles River) were ten weeks old with a body weight (BW) range of 15.1 to 22.2 g on Day 1 of the study. 
 Tumour Cell Culture 
 JIMT-1 human breast carcinoma cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulphate, 25 μg/mL gentamicin, and 2 mM glutamine. Cell cultures were maintained in tissue culture flasks in a humidified incubator at 37° C., in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2  and 95% air. 
 In Vivo Implantation and Tumour Growth 
 The JIMT-1 cells used for implantation were harvested during exponential growth and re-suspended in 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences): 50% phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of 5×10 7  cells/mL. On the day of tumour implant, each test mouse was injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 1×10 7  cells (0.2 mL cell suspension), and tumour growth was monitored as the average size approached the target range of 100 to 150 mm 3 . Tumours were measured in two dimensions using calipers, and volume was calculated using the formula: 
           Tumour   ⁢           ⁢   Volume   ⁢           ⁢     (     mm   3     )       =         w   2     ⁢   xl     2           
where w=width and l=length, in mm, of the tumour. Tumour weight may be estimated with the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm 3  of tumour volume.
 
Treatment
 
 Treatment began on Day 1 in groups of 10 mice (n=10) with established subcutaneous JIMT-1 tumours with volume range (88-196 mm 3 ) and group mean timour volume of 120 to 122 mm 3 . Trastuzumab-10 (ConjA) was administered intravenously once on Day 1 (qd×1). A vehicle-treated group served as the control group for efficacy analysis. Tumours were measured twice per week until the study was ended on Day 59. Each mouse was euthanized when its tumour reached the endpoint volume of 1000 mm 3  or on the final day, whichever came first. The time to endpoint (TTE) was calculated for each mouse. 
 Treatment outcome was determined from percent tumour growth delay (% TGD), defined as the percent increase in median TTE for treated versus control mice, with differences between groups deemed statistically significant at P≤0.05 using logrank survival analysis. Mice were monitored for complete regression (CR) and partial regression (PR) responses. Treatment tolerability was assessed by body weight measurements and frequent observation for signs of treatment-related side effects. All regimens were well tolerated. The median TTE for vehicle-treated controls was 48.4 days, establishing a maximum possible TGD of 10.6 days (22%) for the 59-day study. All ADC regimens tested produced significant survival benefit compared to vehicle-treated controls (P<0.01). 
 The minimum effective dose was defined as the minimum dosage required to produce tumour stasis for twenty-eight days after test article administration. Based on visual inspection of the mean and median tumour volume plots and percent change of tumour volume from Day 1, trastuzumab-10 (ConjA) at 1.0 mg/kg, appeared to be the dosage that achieved a response consistent with the minimum effective dose. 
 A dose-dependent effect was observed where the 0.3 mg/kg group median tumour volume slowly increased through Day 34 then progressed thereafter, while the 1.0 mg/kg group showed static median tumour volume through Day 38 which progressed thereafter. The median TTE for the 0.3 mg/kg group was 56.9 days corresponding to a significant TGD of 8.5 days (18%) versus the control (P<0.05). The 0.3 mg/kg group had no objective regression responses. Five of the 0.3 mg/kg group animals were end of study survivors with an MTV of 486 mm 3 . 
 The median TTE for the 1.0 mg/kg group was a maximal 59.0 days corresponding to a significant TGD of 10.6 days (22%) versus the control (P<0.001). The 1.0 mg/kg group had no objective regression responses. Nine of the 1.0 mg/kg group animals were ‘end of study’ survivors with an MTV of 446 mm3. The 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg groups were significantly different from one another (P<0.05). 
 The results are illustrated in  FIG. 4 . 
 Example 12—Toxicity Studies/Therapeutic Index 
 Rat Study: 
 A single dose toxicity study was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of Trastuzumab-10 (ConjA). Male Sprague Dawley rats (ENVIGO) were dosed once by slow bolus intravenous injection via the tail vein with vehicle control (25 mM Histidine, 200 mM Sucrose, pH 6.0) or test material (ConjA). Parameters evaluated during the study included mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, body weights, body weight changes, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, and coagulation), and gross pathology findings. All animals in groups 1-6 were terminated on Study Day (SD) 29, except one animal in  Group  6 who was terminated on Study Day (SD) 25.

 Tolerability was determined based on toxicity end points, including decreased absolute reticulocytes, white blood cells and cellular components, as well as macroscopic and microscopic lesions in the lungs. The major finding at dose levels of ≥4 mg/kg were histopathological observations of lung lesions. At the 4 mg/kg dose, findings were mild and considered reversible. As the dose increased, the lung lesions were of increasing severity and were not considered reversible. Based on this finding, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the rat after a single dose of ConjA was determined to be 6 mg/kg. 
 Therapeutic Index 
 The Therapeutic Index can be calculated by dividing the maximum tolerated single dose (MTD) of non-targeted ADC in rat, by the minimal effective single dose (MED) of the a targeted ADC. The MED is the single dose necessary to achieve tumour stasis in an in vivo model at 28 days (for NCI-N87 xenograft). 
 Thus for conjugates of  compound  10, the therapeutic index is the MTD of 6 mg/kg divided by the MED which is 1.0 mg/kg (see above), giving a Therapeutic Index of 6.
