 The present invention relates to a kind of composition, it comprises the insecticide that at least one biocontrol agent of cooperative effective quantity and at least one are specified, described biocontrol agent is selected from the mutant with whole recognition features of respective bacterial strain of specified microorganisms and/or these bacterial strains, and/or the metabolite showing anti-insect, nematode and/or phytopathogen activity that at least one is produced by respective bacterial strain.In addition, the present invention relates to the purposes of said composition, and for the method for the overall damage that reduces plant and plant parts. 
 Synthetic pesticide or fungicide are normally nonspecific and therefore can act on organism instead of target organism, comprise other naturally occurring beneficial organisms.Due to their chemical property, also possibility is poisonous and not biodegradable for they.Global consumer recognizes the potential environment relevant to chemical residues and health problem just gradually, particularly in food.This makes the requirement from consumer reduce use chemistry (namely synthesizing) insecticide or at least reduce its pressure measured increases day by day.Therefore, need management food chain demand, still allow effective control of insect simultaneously. 
 Another problem occurred along with the use of synthetic pesticide or fungicide is, repeats and exclusive application insecticide or fungicide cause selecting resistant microorganism usually.Usually, these bacterial strains also have cross tolerance to other active components with the identical mode of action.So described reactive compound no longer effectively may prevent and treat pathogene.But the active component that research and development have novel mechanism is both difficult and expensive. 
 In pathogene population resistance development risk and the interest to the substitute identified for the synthetic pesticide and fungicide controlling plant disease has been caused to the concern of environment and human health.Biocontrol agent (BCA) is used to be a kind of selection.But the validity of most of BCA does not reach the level identical with fungicide with conventional pesticides, particularly when severe infections pressure.Therefore, known biocontrol agent, its mutant and the metabolite produced by it, particularly when low rate of application, not exclusively satisfactory. 
 Therefore, need constantly to research and develop the new plant protection product substituted having at least in some field and help meet the demand.

 The method finally relating in one aspect to nematode in control surrounding plants soil or insect of the present invention, it comprises the present composition to described soil application effective dose. 
 
 Embodiment illustrates the present invention. 
 For calculating the formula of effect that two kinds of compounds combine 
 Expection effect of the given combination of two kinds of compounds presses following calculating (see Colby, S.R., " Calculating Synergistic and antagonistic Responses of HerbicideCombinations ", Weeds 15, pp.20-22,1967): 
 If 
 X is test compounds A effect when concentration is m ppm (being equivalent to m g/ha), represents with the lethality % of untreated control; 
 Y is examination test compounds B effect when concentration is n ppm (being equivalent to n g/ha), represents with the lethality % of untreated control; 
 E is the mixture effect when m and n ppm (being equivalent to m and n g/ha) using A and B, represents with the lethality % of untreated control; 
 Then
               E   =   X   +   Y   -       X   &CenterDot;   Y     100     .         
 If insecticide effect of viewed combination is greater than effect " E " of calculating, so the combination of two kinds of compounds be above add and, namely there is synergistic effect.
