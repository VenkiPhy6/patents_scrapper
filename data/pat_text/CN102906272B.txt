 As used in this application, term " transforms cysteine rate " refers to the amount of product cysteine and the percentage ratio of initiation material OPS.Under best reaction condition, 1 mole of OPS is converted to 1 mole of cysteine.Such as, if the OPS of 100 moles is converted to the cysteine of 100 moles, then transforms cysteine rate is 100%. 
 According to one aspect, the present invention provides the method producing cysteine or derivatives thereof, comprising: 
 1) recombinant microorganism reducing endogenous phosphoserine phosphatase (SerB) activity through modification is cultivated, to produce O-phosphoserine (OPS)；And 2) O-phosphoserine mercapto solution enzyme (OPSS) or express OPSS microorganism exist under, by step 1) OPS and sulfide react, to produce cysteine or derivatives thereof. 
 In the method, step 1) relevant with the recombinant microorganism cultivating endogenous phosphoserine phosphatase (SerB) activity reduction. 
 SerB is the protein with the activity that OPS is hydrolyzed into Serine.Therefore, the recombinant microorganism that endogenous SerB activity reduces is characterised by its accumulation OPS.SerB may include but be not limited to the aminoacid sequence of any performance SerB activity, and preferably can have the aminoacid sequence shown in SEQIDNO:1 or 2.But, as long as showing SerB activity, arbitrary amino acid sequence can be used, it is preferable that with SEQIDNO:1 or 2 have 90% or more than, more preferably 96% or more than, even more preferably from 98% or more than, it is most preferred that 99% or above homology.The SerB activity reduced refers to compared with the bacterial strain before modifying, and SerB activity reduces the cracking including SerB.The method reducing SerB activity is well known in the art.Illustrative examples includes the disappearance of chromosome serB, introduces sudden change in chromosome serB to reduce endogenous SerB activity, to introduce sudden change to the control region of serB to reduce endogenous SerB activity, with mutant gene substituted dyeing body serB to reduce endogenous SerB activity, and the antisense oligonucleotide of introducing and the complementation of serB transcript is to suppress the antisense of mRNA, but the method reducing SerB activity is not limited to this.These methods can be used for reducing the activity of other enzyme in the present invention. 
 The cracking of endogenous SerB causes introducing serine auxotrophy to recombinant microorganism, thus culture medium must add glycine or serine.Glycine can pure glycine, form containing glycine yeast extract or peptone provide.Concentration contained by glycine is 0.1～10g/L, it is preferable that concentration is 0.5～3g/L.As for serine, it can pure silk propylhomoserin, form containing serine yeast extract or peptone provide.Its concentration range in the medium is 0.1～5g/L, it is preferable that 0.1～1g/L. 
 In one embodiment of the invention, when (disrupted) that its endogenous SerB activity is damaged suddenlys change corynebacterium glutamicum (Corynebacteriumglutamicum) or escherichia coli (E.coli) are incubated at containing glycine or serine media, it has been found that it produces more substantial OPS (see table 2,3,6 and 7) compared with wild type. 
 Additionally, the recombinant microorganism of the present invention can have phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (SerA) or phosphoserine aminotransferase (SerC) activity of enhancing.SerA is the protein with the activity that 3-phoshoglyceric acid changes into 3-phosphohydroxypyruvic acid.SerA can have wild-type amino acid or the amino acid sequence variants of anti-serine feedback suppression, but is not limited to these.Preferably, SerA can have a kind of aminoacid sequence in SEQIDNOS:3～7.As long as it shows the sudden change SerA activity of the active or anti-serine feedback suppression of the SerA of wild type, arbitrary amino acid sequence can be used, but its preferably have with the one in SEQIDNO:3～7 90% or more than, more preferably 96% or more than, even more preferably from 98% or more than, it is most preferred that 99% or above homology." the sudden change SerA of feedback-inhibition resistance " refers to regardless of the feedback suppression to serine or glycine, and this sudden change shows the SerA activity maintained or strengthen.Anti feedback mutant is (GrantGA et al., J.Biol.Chem., 39:5357-5361,1999 well known in the art；GrantGA et al., Biochem., 39:7316-7319,2000；GrantGA et al., J.Biol.Chem., 276:17844-17850,2001；Peters-WendischP et al., Appl.Microbiol.Biotechnol., 60:437-441,2002；EP0943687B).In one embodiment of the invention, when further to have the corynebacterium glutamicum of the serB being damaged or escherichia coli import anti feedback serA time, it has been found that it produces more substantial OPS (see table 4 and 9) compared with wild type.
