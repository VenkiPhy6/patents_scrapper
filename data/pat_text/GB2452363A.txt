 NOVEL FISH PATHOGEN   
 Technical field of the invention   
 The present invention relates to a novel fish pathogen. In particular the invention provides a fish virus, which when injected intraperitoneally or intramuscularly into fish, has the ability to introduce the symptoms and disease of Cardiomyopathy Syndrome (CMS). Further the invention pertains to vaccines and therapeutics developed on the basis of this pathogen.   
 Background of the invention  
 Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is emerging as a significant disease problem and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has recommended that it should be classified and handled as a group B disease. The infectious nature of HSMI has been indicated, and the first isolation of the virus was previously reported. By electron microscopy virus-like particles of approximately 70 nm were observed. Most outbreaks are reported in fish transferred to seawater 5-9 months earlier. Cardiac lesions are characterized by myocardial degeneration and infiltration of mononuclear cells in both the spongious and compact layers of the ventricle. Lesions are also regularly observed in the red skeletal muscle localized along the lateral line of the fish, sometimes extended to adjacent white fibres.   
 Cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) is a related disease affecting primarily large Atlantic salmon in the second year in seawater close to harvest, and therefore the economic impact is significant. Affected fish may suddenly die without showing signs of disease, or may show symptoms such as abnormal swimming behaviour and anorexia. CMS is diagnosed on the basis of histopathology, showing severe inflammation and degeneration of spongious myocardium in the atrium and ventricle. A possible secondary effect of circulatory disturbance is multifocal liver necrosis which is commonly observed. Whereas the cause of CMS is still unknown, infectious aetiology has been hypothesized and debated, but not yet proven or rejected. Both intracellular inclusions and virus-like particles have been observed, but reports are not consistent as apparent from a review provided in Kongtorp et a!. 2005: in 1997 Grotmol et a!. reported the presence of nodavirus-like particles in endothelial cells in the heart of Atlantic salmon diagnosed as suffering from CMS. The particles had a diameter of 25 nm. However, the assumed virus was never isolated, and infection trials were never conducted to confirm the aetiology of the disease. In 2005 Hodneland et a!. described the isolation and characterization of a togavirus, salmonid alphavirus 3 (SAV3) from rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon diagnosed with Pancreatic disease or CMS. This Norwegian subtype of the salmonid aiphaviruses is the causative agent of pancreatic disease in Norwegian waters but any involvement of this pathogen in the ethiology of CMS has not been confirmed. Most recently, as documented in a report of November 2007, challenge experiments conducted by the Institute of Aquaculture, University of Stirling, Scotland failed to establish whether CMS is in fact infectious: in these experiments only one of 25 Atlantic salmon developed symptoms of CMS when exposed to cell extracts from kidney and heart from a CMS outbreak. The authors discuss that CMS outbreaks in farmed salmon may be a production problem resulting from fish growing too fast (Report prepared for the Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum by Institute for Aquaculture, University of Stirling, 2007).   
 Consequently, there is a need to first establish whether CMS has viral or bacterial aetiology and, if this is the case, to isolate and characterise the causative agent.   
 Secondly the economical impact which CMS infections may have in the fish farming industry provides the impetus to develop tools for detecting and diagnosing CMS infections and therapeutics for prophylaxis and treatment of CMS infections.   
 Summary of the invention

 The present invention will now be described in more detail in the following.   
 Detailed description of the invention  
 Definitions Prior to discussing the present invention in further details, the following terms and conventions will first be defined: The term "genotypic characteristics" refers broadly to the composition of one or more parts of an individual's genome which contributes to determining a specific trait of the individual. In the context of the present invention, genomic characteristics of the virus may be assessed by RT-PCR using species specific primers.   
 The term "phenotypic characteristics" refers equally broadly to one or more observable properties of an organism that are produced by the inherited genotype or by interaction of the inherited genotype of the individual with transmitted epigenetic factors, and/or non-hereditary environmental variation or factors. In the context of the present invention, the term "related phenotypic characteristics" includes any of the following characteristics: size, shape, density, pH stability, temperature stability, chloroform sensitivity and haemaglutination.   
 "Phenotypic characteristics" further include the ability to induce symptoms or clinical signs of CMS as described in the present application. "Phenotypic characteristics" also include the ability of the virus to introduce such clinical signs in a laboratory challenge experiment when a homogenate from a cell culture or a tissue infected with the CMS virus is injected in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo Salar L.) as described herein.   
 The term "essentially free of other viral or microbial material" as used herein refers to a preparation of a virus according to the invention, wherein the virus has been removed from its natural genetic milieu, and is thus largely free of other extraneous or unwanted viral or microbial material. Thus, when substantially free of other viral or microbial material, the virus of the invention is in a preparation containing at the most 10% by titre or volume of other viral or microbial material (lower percentages of other viral or microbial material are preferred, e.g. at the most 8% by titre or volume, at the most 6% by titre or volume, at the most 5% by titre or volume, at the most 4% by titre or volume, at the most 3% by titre or volume, at the most 2% by titre or volume, at the most 1% by titre or volume, at the most 0.5% by titre or volume, at the most 0.1% by titre or volume, or at the most 0.05% by titre or volume).   
 The term "substantially free of other viral or microbial material" as used herein refers to a preparation of a virus according to the invention, wherein the virus is in a preparation in which other viral or microbial material cannot be detected using conventional techniques like seeding on ISA or cystein heart agar spread plates, seeding in cell cultures known to support the growth of known fish viruses like Pancreas Disease Virus, Infectious Salmon Anemia virus and Infectious pancreatic Necrosis virus and PCR with primers designed against known sequences from fish pathogens. Further, it is to be understood that when "substantially free of other viral or microbial material" the virus of the invention is in a form wherein it may be used for therapeutic purposes.   
 It is to be understood that providing virus according to the invention in preparations being essentially or substantially free of other viral or microbial material does not exclude the possibility of combining such preparations with other viral or microbial material, such as in the polyvalent vaccines disclosed herein.   
 The term "component or part of said virus" refers to a component or part of the nucleic acid core of the virus or of the surrounding protein coat. In the context of the present invention, it is preferred that the said component or part possesses antigenicity. Antigenicity may imply a capacity of the component or part of said virus to induce an immune response,that is to be recognized by and interact with an immunologically specific antibody or T-cell receptor; or a capacity to produce immunity.   
 Aspects and embodiments of the invention Virus A first aspect of the present invention pertains to a virus which is the causative agent of Cardiomyopathy Syndrome. In particular the invention provides a fish virus, which when injected intraperitoneally or intramuscularly in doses of 0.1 - 0.2 mI/fish of an infected GF-1 cell homogenate prepared from ls passage of the virus, has the ability to introduce the symptoms and disease of Cardiomyopathy Syndrome (CMS) and wherein: i) said virus is the strain deposited under the Budapest Treaty with the European Collection of Cell Culture (ECACC), Health Protection Agency, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire (UK), SP4 OJG UK on the 29 March 2007 under the accession number 07032902 or a strain with related genotypic and/or phenotypic characteristics, and/or ii) said virus reacts with immune serum from rabbit raised against the deposited strain under ECACC accession number 07032902.   
 Particular embodiments of the invention pertain to virus being obtainable from said deposited isolates.. As the skilled person will realize, replication of viral genomes may be accompanied by very high mutation rates. In RNA viruses this is due to the lack of proofreading activity of RNA virus polymerases, which leads to a constant generation of new genetic variants e.g. during virus propagation. Also, it is known that different constellations of mutations may be associated with a similar biological behaviour of the virus. Accordingly, the invention includes viruses which are obtainable from the strain deposited under the Budapest Treaty with the European Collection of Cell Culture (ECACC), Health Protection Agency, Porton Down, Salisbury, Wiltshire (UK), SP4 OJG UK on the 29 March 2007 under accession number 07032902, such as by passage of the virus on a cell line or by genetic manipulation. As illustrated in the present application, a useful cell line for the purpose of culturing the virus according to the invention is a GF-1 cell line; GF-l cells are described in US patent 6,436,702 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and have been deposited in the ATCC under deposit no. PTA-859.   
 Genetic manipulation comprises for instance introduction of substitutions and/or deletions of single or multiple nucleic acid residues.   
 In relation to the present invention the ability of the virus to introduce the symptoms and disease of CMS symptoms was demonstrated when a homogenate from a cell culture infected with the CMS virus was injected in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo Salar L.). As the skilled person will acknowledge the virus of the invention is likely to cause similar symptoms after having been injected into or after having infected fish from species within the salmonidae family. In particular the virus is likely to cause similar symptoms and disease in fish from the salmo subfamily of the salmonidae.   
 Specifically, the invention provides a virus in relation to which it. is characteristic that said symptoms are seen when the cell homogenate is injected in a dose of 0.1 ml on each side of the fish in the lateral muscle.   
 Further, the symptoms may be seen in at least 20% of individuals in a population of fish, such as in at least 3O%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 6O%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or in at least 95% of individuals in a population of fish.   
 In particular, the symptoms may appear 6 weeks post challenge or later, such as 7 weeks post challenge or later, 8 weeks post challenge or later, 9 weeks post challenge or later or 10 weeks post challenge or later.   
 In particular embodiments relating to the invention, the virus has the ability of introducing: I) Inflammatory changes in areas of the spongious myocardium in the atrium and/or the ventricle; and/or ii) Abnormal swimming behaviour and/or anorexia; and/or iii) Multifocal liver necrosis.   
 While some variation in the location and severity of the symptoms is to be expected, the inflammatory changes in areas of the spongious myocardium in the atrium and/or the ventricle may appear as foci of degeneration and infiltration of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and/or macrophages, and/or as areas of necrosis, said areas optionally extending along fibres, the foci ranging in   
 number from 1-> 5 per viewed field.   
 The virus according to the invention may have the ability of introducing one or more symptoms selected from the group consisting of: skin haemorrhages, raised scales, exopthalamos, ascites, fibrinous casts over the liver capsule, blood or blood clots filling the pericardial cavity, ruptures in the cardiac atrial wall, dilation of the cardiac atrium, compression of the cardiac ventricle, inflammation of the epi-and endocardium, liver lesions including multifocal to anastomosing necrosis of hepatocytes and fibrinous coating of the capsule, congestion of the spleen and/or the gills.   
 When isolated using rate-zonal density gradient centrifugation on a sucrose gradient, the virus according to the invention localized in a fraction having a refractive index between 1,3950 and 1,4000 and a density in between 1,160 g/cm3 and 1,175 g/cm3, and/or in a fraction having a refractive index between 1,365 and 1,75 and a density in between 1,090g/cm3 and 1,llOg/cm3.   
 The fact that the virus according to the invention is localized in two separate fractions is likely due to the fact that the virus adheres to larger particles/cell debris during the process. Therefore, a part of the virus isolate will be located in the top part of the gradient. It is contemplated that the true density of the virus is in the range of 1,16-1,17 g/cm3 when analysed on a sucrose gradient.   
 For the purpose of analysing the virus according to the invention the rate-zonal density gradient centrifugation was performed using as starting material the supernatant from a culture of GF-1 cells infected with the virus. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17700xg for 30 mm, re-suspended in 4 ml culture media and frozen at -80°C. The supernatant was spun at l00000xg for 3h and the pellet was re-suspended in PBS and frozen at -80°C.   
 The pellet material was diluted in PBS and loaded on to a sucrose density gradient consisting of: 6 ml 36% sucrose in PBS w/v, 6 ml 42% sucrose in PBS w/v, 6 ml 48% sucrose in PBS w/v, 6 ml 54% sucrose in PBS w/v, and 6 ml 60% sucrose in PBS w/v which was subsequently spun at l00000xg at 4°C for 16h. Fractions were collected in 2 ml aliquots from the bottom of the tube, and the refractive index was measured in each fraction.   
 Initial studies suggested that the virus according to the invention has a diameter of 60-100 nm, such as a diameter of 60-70 nm, a diameter of 65-75 nm, a diameter of 70-80 nm, a diameter of 75-85 nm, a diameter of 80-90 nm, a diameter of 85-95 nm or a diameter of 90-100 nm.   
 Inspection of electron micrographs (EM) of infected cell cultures suggested, that the virus according to the invention is a spherical virus. Further the EM analyses indicated that the virus according to the invention has an approximate diameter of nm. By "an approximate diameter of 70 nm" is to be understood a diameter in the range of 65-75 nm, such as in the range of 67-75 nm, 67-73 nm, 65-73 nm, or such as 67-73 nm.   
 Analyses by PCR on reverse transcribed RNA from the virus according to the invention has indicated that the virus has genotypic characteristics which are different from those of the salmonid alphaviruses, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), and nodavirus, including grouper nervous necrosis virus, In particular, this was shown in studies where 1,7pg RNA isolated from the virus according to the invention was reverse transcribed using random hexamers as primers.   
 PCR was performed on the reverse transcribed products using the following primers: Primers specific for salmonid alphavirus: forward primer -CGTCALIUCACCAGCGACTCCCAGACG (SEQ ID NO: 1) reverse primer -GGATCCAUCGGATGTGGCGUGATGG (SEQ ID NO: 2) Primers specific for IPNV: Forward primer -GTCCGGTGTAGACATcAMG (SEQ ID NO: 3) Reverse primer -TGCAGTTCCTCGTCCATCC (SEQ ID NO: 4); Primers specific for Grouper nervous necrosis virus (Noda-virus): Forward primer -GGATTTGGACGTGGGACCAA (SEQ ID NO: 5) Reverse primer -CGGATGACCCGGTTAG i I i [C (SEQ ID NO: 6); The analysis is performed using in a standard PCR reaction, comprising heating of the sample to 95°C for 5 mm, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 60 sec, followed by a single step of heating to 72°C for 10 mm. While a detailed description of the RT-PCR methodology is provided in example 8 in the present application, it will be within the capacity of the skilled person to conduct such analyses using general knowledge on the requirements for buffers, polymerases, primers, nucleotide mixtures and the like.   
 Using standard PCR conditions and temperatures as described above it was not possible to detect any significant product formation in any of the tests.   
 Accordingly, the CMS virus as provided herein does not contain a ribonucleic acid species capable of forming significant amounts of a product with any one of the PCR primer pairs selected from the group consisting of: i) a forward primer having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 and a reverse primer having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2; ii) a forward primer having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3 and a reverse primer having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 4; and iii) a forward primer having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: and a reverse primer having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6; when analysed in a standard PCR reaction on reverse transcribed RNA isolated from the fish virus, comprising heating of the sample to 95°C for 5 mm, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30 sec, and elongation at 72°C for 60 sec, followed by a single step of heating to 72°C for 10 mm. As illustrated in example 7 of the present application, studies have been conducted in order to asses the ability of the virus according to the invention to grow in cultures of various cell lines which are commonly used to support growth of known viral fish pathogens. As demonstrated, the fish virus according to the invention, when provided in a tissue homogenate from an infected fish, is incapable of growing in any cell line from the group consisting of: BF-2 (Bluegill fry, caudal trunk, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CCL-91TM), BB (Brown bullhead, connective tissue and muscle, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CCL-59TM), RTG-2 (Rainbow trout, gonadal tissue, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CCL-55TM), SHK-1 (salmon head, kidney, established by Dannevig et al. as reported in 1995 and commonly available in research laboratories), CHSE-214 (Chinook salmon, embryo, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CRL-1681TM), CCO (Channel catfish, ovary, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CRL-2772TM), CHH-1 (Chum salmon, heart fibroblast, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CRL-1680TM) and FHM (Fat head minnow, epithelial like, available from LCG Promochem as ATCC� Number: CCL-42TM).   
 As mentioned in the example most of these cell lines are permissive for one or more known viral fish pathogens, providing further indication that the virus according to the invention has phenotypic characteristics which are different from those of Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV), Viral Haemorrhagic Syndrome Virus (VHSV), Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV), Channel Catfish Virus (CCV), Spring Viremia of Carp (SVCV), Infectious salmon Anemia Virus, Pancreatic Disease Virus (PDV) and Catfish Tumour Virus (Clv).   
 In a further embodiment the virus according to the invention is inactivated by incubation with 10% v/v chloroform for 30 minutes at 20°C with continuous shaking. The sensitivity towards chloroform treatment indicates the presence of an envelope containing essential lipids.   
 In yet a further embodiment the fish virus according to the invention is inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 30 minutes while it is insensitive to incubation at 60°C for 30 minutes.   
 In other embodiments the culture of the fish virus according to the invention is insensitive to incubation with 100 jig/mI DNA synthesis inhibitor bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In these embodiments the insensitivity to DNA synthesis inhibitors indicates that the virus according to the invention is an RNA virus.   
 In still other embodiments the fish virus according to the invention is inactivated after incubation 4 hours with pH 3.0 at 15°C, whereas pH 5.0 has no effect compared with pH 7.2.   
 It is with.in the scope of the present invention to provide an isolate of the virus described above. The virus of the invention may thus be in an isolated form and/or substantially or essentially free of other viral or microbial material.   
 It is further within the scope of the invention to provide a virus as described above which is either attenuated or inactivated. Several approaches for obtaining attenuated virus are available to the skilled person. An attenuated strain of a virus may be generated for instance by passing the virus through cell culture a number of times, or deleting or mutating a gene involved in its replication pathway.   
 Inactivation of the virus may be obtained by chemical or physical means.   
 Chemical inactivation can be carried out by treatment of the viruses by for example, but not limited to, treatment with enzymes, With formaldehyde, -propiolactone or ethyleneimine or a derivative thereof, with organic solvent (e.g. halogenated hydrocarbon) and/or detergent, e.g. Triton� or Tween�. Physiological inactivation can advantageously be carried out by subjecting the viruses to energy-rich radiation, such as UV light, gamma irradiation or X-rays. If necessary, the inactivating agent can be neutralized with thiosulphate. If required, the pH is subsequently returned to about pH 7.   
 Infected cell line A second aspect o                                  f the invention provides a cell line comprising the fish virus as defined in above. Several cell lines may be used for propagation of the virus. In preferred embodiments, however, the cell line is derived from Epinephelus coloides.   
 In particular embodiments the cell line is a GF-1 cell line; GF-1 cells are described in US patent 6,436,702 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and have been deposited in the ATCC under deposit no. PTA-859. Another example of a useful cell line is the ASL cell line derived from Atlantic salmon liver. Cells were isolated from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) liver by a two-step collagenase perfusion procedure according to Dannevig and Berg (1985). The cells have been sub-cultured more than 20 times.   
 Vaccine Another aspect of the invention pertains to a vaccine comprising a virus as defined above, or a component or part of said virus.   
 The skilled person will realise that the content of a vaccine preparation varies depending on the intended use of the vaccine. In presently preferred embodiments of the invention, such as the test vaccine which is used in the clinical trial illustrated in Example 11 herein very low amounts of antigen are used. As illustrated in the example, good protection against histopathological changes typical for CMS are shown in fish vaccinated with CMS vaccine containing for instance 0.016 mg antigen/dosage or 0.16 mg antigen/mi of vaccine formulation. According to these embodiments the vaccine comprises an amount of antigen, which is in the range of 0.05-1.0 mg/mI, such as from 0.15 to 0.5 mg/mi, from 0.15 -0,4 mg/mI, from 0.15 -0,3 mg/mI or such as from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/mI, from 0.1 -0,4 mg/mI, from 0.1 -0,3 mg/mi, from 0.1 -0,25 mg/mI or such as from 0.1 -0.2 mg/ml.The vaccine may be for administration in dosages of 0.005-0.5 mg/individual, preferably from 0.01-0.05 mg/individual, or such as from 0.01-0.02 mg/individual.   
 In a final product approved for commercial use in aquaculture, the preferred amount of antigen may be somewhat higher. According to embodiments pertaining to such products the preferred amount of antigen may be in the range of 0.5-2.0 mg/mI, such as from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/mi, from 0.5 -1,3 mg/mI, from 0.6 -1,5 mg/mI or 0.7-1.5 mg/mI, such as from 0.8 to 1.5 mg/mI, from 0.9 -1,5 mg/mi, from 0.7 -1,4 mg/mI, from 0.7-1.3 mg/mI, from 0.7-1.2 mg/mI, such as from 0.8 to 1.4 mg/mI, from 0.8 -1,3 mg/mI, from 0.8 -1,2 mg/mI or from 0.9- 1.4 mg/mi, such as from 0.9 to 1.3 mg/mi, from 0.9 -1,2 mg/mI. For such embodiments a most preferred amount of antigen of 1 mg/mI is presently contemplated. Additional embodiments provide a vaccine comprising an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 10510b0 per dosage, such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 106_109 per dosage, an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of per dosage, such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 5x107-5x108 per dosage, such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 8x107-4x108 per dosage, such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 1x108-4x108 per dosage, such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 1x108-3x108 per dosage, such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 1-2x108 or such as an amount of antigen corresponding to a TCID50 of 1.5x108 per dosage.   
 The vaccine may be in the form of a suspension of the virus or it may be lyophilized. In a lyophilized vaccine it may be useful to add one or more stabilizers. Suitable stabilizers are for example carbohydrates such as sorbitol, mannitol, starch, sucrose, dextran; protein containing agents such as bovine serum or skimmed milk; and buffers such as alkali metal phosphates.   
 The vaccine according to the invention may further be in a formulation comprising an adjuvant. Examples of adjuvants frequently used in fish and shellfish farming are muramylciipeptjdes lipopolysaccharjdes several glucans and glycans, mineral oil, MontaniderM and Carbopol�. An extensive overview of adjuvants suitable for fish and shellfish vaccines is given in the review paper by Jan Raa (1996), the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.   
 The vaccine of the invention may further comprise a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. In a currently preferred embodiment the vaccine is formulated as an emulsion of water in oil. The vaccine may also comprise a so-called "vehicle". A vehicle is a device to which the antigen adheres, without being covalently bound to it. Such vehicles are l.a. biodegradable nano/micro-parsjcles or -capsules of PLGA (poly-lactide-co-glycolic acid), alginate or chitosan, liposomes, niosomes, micelles, multiple emulsions and macrosols, all known in the art. A special form of such a vehicle, in which the antigen is partially embedded in the vehicle, is the so-called ISCOM (European patents EP 109.942, EP 180.564 and EP 242.380, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).   
 In addition, the vaccine may comprise one or more suitable surface-active compounds or emulsifiers, e.g. Cremophore�, Tween� and Span�. Also adjuvants such as interleukin, CpG and glycoproteins may be used.

 Examples  
 Examole 1: Challenge study comoaring HSMI and CMS Heart tissue from Atlantic salmon experiencing a clinical outbreak of HSMI was collected and homogenized with quarts sand in a porcelain mortar, centrifuged at 3000 xg, the supernatant passed through a 45mm syringe filter ((sartorius 17829) and inoculated into GF-1 cell cultures. After 7-10 days, cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed in infected cells. Lysed and filtrated material from these infected cells was further used to infect fresh cell cultures and similar vacuolization was observed.   
 Inflamed heart tissue was collected from a clinical outbreak of CMS and treated as described above. Clarified heart tissue homogenate was inoculated onto GF-1 cell cultures resulting in cytoplasmic vacuoles in infected cells, with morphology similar to that of HSMI infected cells. Lysed and filtrated material from these infected cells was further used to infect fresh cell cultures and similar vacuolization was observed.   
 As both diseases are usually observed in seawater, the clinical trial was conducted in seawater. A challenge study was conducted using a "CMS viral isolate" material.   
 The lysed and filtered material described above was used for intramuscular injection of fish in seawater. Samples of heart and red muscle tissue were collected at defined intervals to follow the development of the disease. The intention was to examine whether material cultured from fish with a CMS or HSMI diagnosis would produce similar or different clinical signs in Atlantic salmon. This would provide information as to whether CMS and HSMI may be caused by the same or different viral agents.   
 Objectives The main objective of this pilot challenge study was to gain knowledge of the development of HSMI and CMS in seawater, and to compare these disease entities in terms of development of histopathological changes in internal organs.   
 Schedule The major dates were as follows: Task Activity Experimental week Start of Transfer of fish to Week -6 experiment experimental cell Seawater Transfer of fish to seawater Week 0 transfer Challenge Tank 1: HSMIV challenge by Week 0 and control i.m. injection of 50 fish + 20 sampling cohabitants.

Examination was carried out using a Zeiss light _____________ microscope.   
 Assessment criteria The assessment of histological changes in HSMI challenged fish was performed on the basis of the criteria given below and the scoring was marked on a visual analog scale (VAS).   
 Inflammation Pathological description   
 score for HSMI infected fish 0 No pathological changes observed.   
 1 Mild pathological changes characterized by a limited number (countable) of mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrating the epicardium, not extending into the compact layer of the ventricle. The infiltration of cells is multifocal to diffuse and can involve parts of or the entire epicardium available for assessment.   
 2 Moderate pathological changes consisting of high number (uncountable) of inflammatory cells in the epicardium and extending into the compact layer of the heart. The changes in the compact layer can be multifocal or diffuse and typically orient along small blood vessels. A few focal changes can also be seen in the spongious layer.   
 3 Severe pathological changes characterized by intense infiltration of inflammatory cells in the epicardium, extending into the compact layer, typically with a diffuse distribution pattern and involving the spongius layer in a multifocal pattern. Degeneration and or necrosis of muscle fibers are seen. Atrium can also be involved with inflammatory changes comparable to what is seen in the ventricle.   
 The criteria listed above were of no use for the evaluation of the changes seen in CMS infected fish. A new score scheme was prepared and the scoring and grading are given below.   
 Inflammation Pathological description   
 score for CMS challenged fish 0 No pathological changes observed.   
 1 Inflammatory changes are seen in the atrium primarily and these appear as foci of degeneration and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The foci are limited in number, 2-3, limited in size and involve a few muscle fibres. A few foci, similar to what is seen in the atrium, can also be observed in the ventricle, typically in the spongious part.   
 2 Inflammatory changes are seen in the atrium and in the ventricle and these appear as multiple foci of degeneration and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The foci are more numerous (>5 in the atrium and > 3 in the ventricle), involve larger areas of the atrium and the ventricle and several muscle fibres are involved in the changes observed.   
 3 Inflammatory changes are seen in the atrium and in the ventricle and these appear at this stage as multiple larger foci of degeneration and necrosis, accompanied with infiltration of inflammatory cells, typically macrophages. The foci are several in the atrium, in areas confluent and larger areas of degeneration/necrosis are found in the ventricle, and extend along fibres and can involve several fibres.   
 Results HSMI challenged fish The first histological changes typical of HSMI were seen by week 6 in injected fish (4 of 6 examined) with an average score of 0.25 (�95% conf limits of 0.32) indicating variation between fish. There was no increase seen by 7w and a slight decline by week 8. A marked increase in number of fish showing changes were found by week 9 and the average score increased to 1,1 (�95% conf limits of 0,5). The same average score was found by week 10.   
 Changes were also found in the red muscle, in 2 fish by week 7, no fish at 8w, 5 fish by week 9 and in 6 fish (of 7 sampled) at lOw. The changes in the red muscle tissue were mild, characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, typically around small vessel and in the intermuscular tissue accompanied by a few degenerate muscle cells.   
 The findings are summarized in figure 1 of the present application.   
 Histological changes were observed in the cohabitant group (HSMI) by week 10, and the average score in this group was 1,26 (�95% conf limits of 0,32). One fish was also found with minor changes in the heart by week 8, but the remaining 5 fish at this time point were scored negative. The summary of the findings in the cohabitants at 6, 8 and 10 weeks (when sampling was performed) is given in figure 2.   
 It is interesting to note that the average score for the cohabitant fish are as high as in the injected ones and fish also exhibited typical changes in red muscle tissue, 1 of 6 by 6 weeks, and 3 of 8 by 10 weeks.   
 CMS challenged fish The histological changes seen in the heart of fish challenged with CMS inoculum deviated markedly from the HSMI infected fish. The scoring scheme developed for the HSMI fish was of no use to assess the changes observed in this group and for this reason a new scoring scheme was established.   
 The first indications of pathological changes in the CMS group were seen at 6weeks post challenge, where 4 of 6 fish exhibited varying degree of histomorphological changes. In 4 of the fish, the atrium was included in the specimens provided for assessment. By 7 weeks, all fish (8/8) had changes in the heart, and in only 2 fish the atrium was available for evaluation, meaning that the changes observed were found also in the ventricle. At 8 weeks, 8/8 fish were positive (4 of 8 came with atrium present in the sections). By 9 and 10 weeks, all fish showed morphological changes, 4 of 4 had atrium present at 9 weeks, while 5 of 7 had atrium present at lOweeks. The findings are summarized in figure 3 and below.   
 Note that the skeletal muscle is not included in the figures as no fish infected with the CMS inoculum were found with changes in this organ, at any of the time points examined.   
 Fish were found positive for typical CMS changes in the cohabitant group by 6 weeks, however with very low scores (2 of 6 fish were positive; 3 of 6 with atrium present in sections). By 8 weeks, 1 fish was found positive and by 10 weeks, 3 of 7 were found positive, at both time points the changes observed were minor (below 0.5 on the visual analogue scale).   
 Representative histological sections of heart tissue from individuals infected with CMS and HSMI are presented in figures 5 and 6, respectively. As illustrated in figure 5, CMS infection primarily involves the atrium recognised as focal inflammation with associated degeneration and necrosis of muscle cells. Focal inflammation is also seen in the ventricle with degeneration and necrosis of muscle cells and accompanying inflammatory changes. At later stages the inflammatory changes also involve macrophages.   
 At early time points post infection HSMI infection (figure 6) involves inflammatory changes (lymphocytic) in the epicard. Changes are extending along vessels of the compact layer to involve larger parts over time (diffuse inflammation) while changes in the atrium are infrequently seen.   
 The findings are summarised in figure 4 and in the comments/summary below.   
 Comments/summary   
 The findings in the study can be summarised as follows; 1) HSMI-and CMS-challenge result in two different categories/entities of histological changes in the heart tissue: a. HSMI changes are initially found in the epicardium of the ventricle, develop in intensity and extend into underlying muscle tissue involving the spongious part of the ventricle and extend also to the atrium at late stages.   
 b. CMS changes are initially found in the atrium but can occur simultaneously in the ventricle. The changes seem to develop more rapidly though in the atrium. Epicardial changes (inflammatory changes) are absent or insignificant in CMS challenged fish.   
 c. The characteristics of the inflammatory cells involved in the changes observed are also different, typically lymphocytic in HSMI and involving more macrophage-like cells in CMS, particularly at late stages of disease.   
 2) The HSMIV and CMSV spread to other fish (cohabitants) over a lOweek period, however the findings in this study are that HSMIV spread more readily by cohabitation.   
 Examole 2: Temoerature stability and liDid solvent sensitivity test of HSMI and CMS cell culture suoernatants.   
 Intention: The aim was to determine the lipid solvent sensitivity and temperature stability of HSMI and CMS cell culture supernatants produced in GF-1 cells.

 Methods: Chloroform sensitivity test Chloroform was added to the two virus controls, the test materials and control growth medium to a final concentration of 10% (v/v)1 and shaken for 30 minutes at room temperature (Ca 20°C). After centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 minutes, two cell cultures per sample were inoculated with 150pl supernatant. The cell cultures were incubated at 15°C for 19 days.   
 Temperature stability 400 p1 aliquots of virus controls and test materials were heated for 30 minutes at 50, 60 and 70°C and then cooled immediately by inoculation of 150p1 sample into two cell cultures per sample. The cell cultures were incubated at 15°C for 19 days.   
 The same positive controls as for the chloroform test were used.   
 Results: Both HSMI and CMS samples were inactivated with chloroform and 30 mm treatment at 70°C, whereas temperatures up to 60°C had no effect on the development of CPE/vacuoles after inoculation of GF- 1 cell cultures.   
 PD virus was inactivated both with chloroform and 30 mm treatment at 50°C.   
 IPNV resisted chloroform and 30 mm treatment at temperatures up to 70°C, but the infection seemed to be slightly delayed at the highest temperatures.

 ExamDle 3: Sensitivity to DNA synthesis inhibitor The purpose is to examine if the use of DNA synthesis inhibitor bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) inhibits HSMIV and CMS infections in cell lines (GF-1), and thus indicate whether the viruses are RNA or DNA viruses.   
 BrdU is a synthetic thymidine analog that gets incorporated into a cell's DNA when the cell is dividing (during the S phase of the cell cycle).   
 Negative control: IPNV (double stranded RNA virus) infected BF-2 cells.

 Conclusions I findings:   
 IPNV (RNA virus) infection was not inhibited by BrdU.   
 Irido (DNA virus) infection was inhibited by BrdU.   
 HSMI virus infection in early stages (up to 10 days) was not inhibited by BrdU.   
 Beyond 14 days of incubation, more vacuoles were observed in flasks without BrdU. This is possibly due to inhibited cell division when BrdU is present, resulting in inhibited virus propagation.   
 CMS virus infection in early stages (up to 10 days) was not inhibited by BrdU.   
 Beyond 14 days, more vacuoles were observed in flasks without BrdU This is possibly due to inhibited cell division when BrdU is present, resulting in inhibited virus propagation.   
 The DNA synthesis inhibitor BrdU also affected the cells. At late timepoints BF-2 cells showed morphological changes due to the BrdU in the medium. GF-1 cells also responended to the BrdU in the medium. GF-1 cells did not divide, but grew large and streched. Some cells had detached. This was observed in both uninfected and infected cell cultures.   
 ExamDle 5: oH stability test of HSMIV and CMSV infected cell culture supernatants Intention The aim was to determine the pH stability of HSMI and CMS virus infected cell culture supernatants produced on GF-1 cells.   
 Materials Virus controls * IPNV: ALPHARMA AS, IPNV control (095), (-80 C), 30.05.-03.   
 * PD virus: ALV-405, p6, 19.02.-07.

 * GF-1 cell cultures: 25cm2 cell culture flasks with 4.5 x GF-1 cells (p43) per cm2 * Growth medium: L-15 (Sigma L-5520, lot 086K2414) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen 10101-145, lot 3105387 S1 1% L-glutamine (Sigma G-7513,lot 66K2435) and 0.1% Gentamicin (Sigma G-1397, lot 66K2433) Methods The pH in L-15 was adjusted to 5.0 and 3.0 by addition of 1.OM HCI, and the pH adjusted L-15 solutions were sterile filtrated (0.2Opm). 350p1 test substances or control virus were incubated in 5m1 of the respective L-15 solutions in addition to normal L-15 (pH 7.2) for 4 hours at 15°C. After incubation, the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 1.OM NaOH before 2.5m1 of each solution were inoculated into two parallel 25cm2 cell cultures in 5m1 growth medium. All flasks were incubated at 15°C for three weeks and microscopically examined twice per week.   
 Results Both HSMI and CMS virus were inactivated after incubation 4 hours with pH 3.0 at 15°C, whereas pH 5.0 had no effect compared with pH 7.2 on the development of CPE/vacuoles after inoculation of GF-1 cell cultures.   
 PD virus was not completely inactivated at pH 3.0 or 5.0, but the infection was significantly delayed in flasks inoculated with pH 5.0 treated virus, and even more delayed in the flasks inoculated with the pH 3.0 treated virus.   
 IPNV was not affected by treatment al pH 3.0 or 5.0.

 Conclusion   
 * Both HSMI and CMS virus were inactivated after a 4 hour treatment with pH 3.0 at 15°C, whereas pH 5.0 had no effect on the development of the cytopathogen effect (CPE) after inoculation of GF-1 cell cultures.   
 Examole 6: Test of hemagglutination and hemabsorption. HSMI and CMS virus A test for hemagglutination and hemabsorption was performed with HSMI and CMS as a part of the characterization of the HSMI og CMS agents.   
 Hemagalutination: Virus inoculates: -HSMI Alv 702 1004.06 -Isolate "CMS" 1004.06 -Positive control: Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) -Negative control: Supernatant from GF-1 cell culture Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar -appr. 1kg fish) red blood cells (RBC): suspension of washed (3 x in PBS) erythrocytes (0.5%) in PBS.   
 The test was performed in 96 well plates (Nunc 268152) Final concentration RBC: 0.25% Total final volume per well: 200pl Incubated at 15°C for 1 hour.

 The flasks were inspected under a microscope, and no hemabsorption was visible.   
 ExamDle 7: Test of the CMS virus stock for contamination with other virus The different cell lines were grown according to the literature and infected with lOOpI CMS virus 1. passage stock. The cultures were observed for 28 days and appearance of cytopathogen effect was recorded. If a cytopathogen effect was observed, the culture was termed positive, if not the culture was termed negative.

 Example 8: PCR-analyses of the CMS virus stock using sDecies sDeciflc primers Virus isolates: 4,5x10E04 GF-1 cells/cm2 was transferred to 2 x 175cm2 cell flasks and 1 x 75cm2 flask. Both 175cm2 flasks were inoculated with 500pl homogenate from fish with a CMS diagnosis.   
 The CMSV positive flasks were freeze/thawed in 2 cycles 13 days post infection. At this point, the positive flasks showed severe CPE, while the negative control did not deviate from the normal morphology. The cell lysate was pulled through a 23g and then a 25g syringe, before being sterile filtered (0,2Opm). The lysate was then dispensed in 4,5 ml tubes and frozen at -80°C.   
 Positive controls: Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV) and Grouper Nervous Necrosis Virus (GNNV) from cell culture, Salmonid Alphavirus 3 E2 gene, plasmid mini prep. The GNNV was used as a positive control for nodaviruses. The primers used in the PCR reaction will also recognise other nodaviruses like Viral Nervous Necrosis virus (VNNV) from cod.   
 RNA isolation: RNA was isolated using TriZol procedure in accordance with protocol (Invitrogen).   
 RT-reaction: The following reactions were set up: -6pl RNA template (1,7pg CMSV RNA 202,74ng IPNV RNA or 753,l8ng GNNV RNA) -ipi Random Hexamers (5Ong/pl) -ipI Annealing Buffer The reaction were incubated at 65°C for 5mm, and then on ice for at least a minute.

The SAV specific primers (SEQ ID Nos: 1 and 2) recognise all known types of salmonid aiphavisru (SAy), the GNNV specific primers (SEQ ID Nos: 5 and 6) recognise most VNN, and the IPNV specific primers recognise most of the IPNV serotypes. These tests indicate that the CMS virus isolates are not contaminated by IPNV, nodavirus or salmonid alphavirus. The results further suggest that the CMS virus does not have close resemblance to any of these viruses and that it has genotypic characteristics which are different from the genotypic characteristics of any of these viruses.   
 ExamDle 9: Electron micrograDh Cells were grown in slide flasks and infected with CMS virus according to the invention. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer. They were further post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, followed by staining with 1.5% uranyl acetate in distilled water. Upon dehydration though increasing alcohol concentrations the specimens were embedded in Epon plastic resin. Ultrathin sections were cut and post-stained with 0. 2% lead citrate.   
 Sections were examined in a Philips CM 100 at 80 ky.   
 Results: Examination of the electron micrographs revealed the presence of spherical virus-like particles structures having a diameter of approximately 70 nm.   
 ExamDle 10: CMSV cultivation in cell factory (CF-i) and subseauent isolation of virus In order to achieve a high virus titer, putative CMSV was cultivated in GF-1 cells in a cell factory (CF-b + CF-i). A CMS positive tissue homogenate was used as inoculum.   
 Since isolation of CMSV after the 2nd passage has been difficult to identify (no CPE), a homogenate was chosen as inoculum in the cell factory (p1). Further cultivation after the isolation (p2) procedure would then hopefully yield the expected CPE in CF-i cells (vacuolization).   
 Experimental and Results Homogenate: The homogenate was made of 4 hearts, Atlantic salmon -Salmo salar -diagnosed with CMS, each weighing approx. lOg. The salmons were all localized to Vindsvik, Rogaland, Norway.   
 Bulbus arteriosus was removed and the remaining atrium and ventricle was cut in to smaller pieces with a sterile scalpel. The tissue was then crushed, in combination with quartz sand and 80m1 L-i5 media, using a pestle. This step was followed by centrifugation at 2000xg for 10mm, and filtration of the supernatant (0,2 pm).   
 Growth in cell factory: Od�i: GF-1 cells were trypsinated and transferred to one CF-i and one CF-ia in a concentration of 4,5E4 cells/cm2. 9 ml of CMSV homogenate was added to the cell suspension upon transfer. 7dDi:   
 Examination revealed developing vacuoles and slightly toxic effect.   
 i5dDi: No changes.   
 iO 37dii: At this point, CPE could be observed in almost all cells, and cell culture supernatant was harvested from both CF-i and CF-b (approx. 2L).   
 Rate-zonal density gradient: The supernatant was centrifuged at 17700xg in a iA-b rotor for 30 mm. The pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml L-15 media and frozen at -80°C.   
 Refractive index of the supernatant was measured and found to be 1,3360, the equivalent to a density of 1,0060g/cm3. This step was performed because the media in a GF-i cell culture tend to be fairly viscous.   
 The supernatant was spun at i00000xg for 3h in a iS 24.38 rotor, which was capable of spinning a volume of 6x38m1 at a time. For every round in the centrifuge the 6 pellets were re-suspended in a total of 150pl PBS and frozen at -80°C.   
 Sucrose density gradients: -6m1 36% sucrose in PBS w/v -6m1 42% sucrose in PBS w/v -6ml 48% sucrose in PBS w/v -6m1 54% sucrose in PBS w/v -6ml 60% sucrose in PBS w/v After layering the different sucrose concentrations in the tube, it was incubated at 4°C over night.   
 600pl of pellet material (after ultra-centrifugation) was diluted to 5ml in PBS and loaded on to the gradient, which subsequently was spun at i00000xg at 4°C for 16h. When the gradient was examined after run, a band was clearly visible in the denser part of the gradient. Also, two weaker bands were visible in the upper, less dense part of the gradient.   
 Fractions were collected in 2 ml aliquots from the bottom of the tube, and the refractive index was measured in each fraction (Table 1).

 Pelleted material was re-suspended in l50pl PBS.   
 75pl of each fraction was used as inoculums in respective 25cm2 cell flasks with 4.5x10E04 GF-1 cells/cm2. Cells were incubated at 15°C and inspected routinely.   
 The only flasks showing cells with CPE were the ones inoculated with fraction 5 and 14. The CPE was characterized by vacuolated cells, and was observed from 7 dpi with increasing intensity.   
 Conclusions/findings:   
 After removing most of the cellular debris from a cell culture supernatant (CF-b, with GF-1 inoculated with CMS positive material) by conventional centrifugation, high-speed centrifugation was applied in order to concentrate the viral load in the supernatant. After concentrating the material, a rate-zonal density gradient centrifugation was performed. The resulting gradient showed two bands which, in a following cell culture experiment, gave a CPE with the usual characteristics (both time and morphology) associated with CMS positive material in GF-1 cells.   
 Example 11: Preparation of antigen for vaccines and immunization of rabbits CMS-material stock was prepared from homogenates of heart tissue from fish diagnosed with CMS. The heart tissue (1,3 g) was homogenized in a mortar with the addition of sand and was suspended in (3,2 ml) L-15 (Sigma L-5520, lot 64K22413) with 10% FBS (Sigma F-3885, lot 012K84132), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma G-7513,lot 24K2431) and 0.1% Gentamicin (Sigma G-1397, lot 113K2312). The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000xg.   
 The supernatant was filtered through a 45 m syringe filter (sartorius 17829) and was subsequently kept frozen at -80°C.   
 Antigen was prepared with the use of GF-1 cells (ATCC PTA-859) infected with 1st passage stock of CMS-material stock. The cells were seeded at 4.5 x i04 cells/cm2 and were infected with 400 gtl 1st passage of CMS-material stock per 75 cm2. The cell cultures were incubated for 14-18 days at 15°C until a cytopathogen effect (CPE) was visibie throughout the entire culture. The supernatant was removed and collected in 50 ml vials and subsequently spun at 3000xg for 30 minutes. The supernatant was transferred into transparent centrifuge tubes and spun at l00000xg for two hours. The resulting pellet (A) was re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).   
 The cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman and were transferred to sample vials. The cells were then homogenised by passing the material 5 times through a 21G syringe 5 times through a 23G syringe and, finally, 4-5 times through a 25G. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 mm. at 3000xg. The supernatant was transferred to centrifuge tubes (clear transparent) and was centrifuged for 2 hours at 100000 xg. The resulting pellet (B) was re-suspended in PBS. The re-suspended pellets (A) and (B) were combined.   
 Inactivation was performed by adding formalin in relative amounts of 2000 ppm (2 g/liter). The antigen was transferred to new tubes and incubated at room temperature for 48 hours. Finally, the antigen was dialysed against PBS in a cassette, cut off value being 10.000. PBS was changed three times, the antigen being left overnight in the last change of PBS.   
 Protein Dilution mg/mi OD-1 concentration Blank was determined using the DC protein assay from BioRad: Sample CMS 4 0,767002 0,0305 16 1,056199 0,0105 CMS = 0.8 mg/mI A water-in-oil fish vaccine was prepared containing a 1:5 dilution of the antigen prepared as described above per ml.   
 Clinical trial: A clinical trial was run using ca 30 g Atlantic salmon post smolts. The trial was run in salt water at 12°C. Each fish was injected with a 0.1 ml dose of vaccine. Six weeks later the fish were challenge intramuscularly with 0.2 ml of 1.st passage.   
 Samples were collected at 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks post challenge, and changes in the atrium and ventricle of the heart was determined by histological analyses using standard methods.   
 The results show that the fish vaccinated with the CMS vaccine is protected against histopathological changes resembling CMS. Some fish become positive for histopathological changes when challenged with CMSV, but the changes disappear 10-12 weeks after challenge. This shows that a vaccine containing inactivated CMS virus can protect against the development of CMS. There was no significant reduction of histopathological changes in fish which had received a HSMI vaccine as compared to PBS controls.
