 [table 9] produces O- acetylhomoserine by flask culture 
 
 
 
 By flask culture carry out the production of O- acetylhomoserine the result shows that, KCCM11146P bacterial strain production
14.2g/L O- acetylhomoserine, and KCCM11146P-AD bacterial strain produces 16.7g/L O- acetylhomoserine, increases
17.6%, although it shows that absorbance (OD) is reduced. 
 The building of the O- acetylhomoserine high yield microorganism of<4-2>citrate synthase reduced activity and its evaluation 
 It whether is measurement KCCM11146P bacterial strain --- O- acetylhomoserine high yield bacterial strain --- even in lemon
Acid synthase activity also produces the O- acetylhomoserines of higher yields when weakening, will weaken egg shown in embodiment<2-1>
The modification of the 145th amino acids of highest O- acetylhomoserine production capacity is shown in the active three kinds of variant types of white matter
(modification from tyrosine (Y) to alanine (A)) and the 167th amino acids (is applied to from lysine (K) to alanine (A))
KCCM11146P bacterial strain. 
 The same embodiment of construction method<2-2>, in this way, constructing two kinds of citrate synthase reduced activity
KCCM11146P bacterial strain, and it is respectively designated as " KCCM11146P-A145 " and " KCCM11146P-A167 ". 
 By erlenmeyer flask culture test citrate synthase reduced activity KCCM11146P-A145 and
The O- acetylhomoserine yield of two kinds of bacterial strains of KCCM11146P-A167.By three kinds of bacterial strains (that is, KCCM11146P-A145 and
KCCM11146P-A167 bacterial strain and KCCM11146P bacterial strain) it is inoculated in LB culture medium, and the overnight incubation at 33 DEG C.Then, will
Its single colony is inoculated in 3mL LB culture medium, cultivates 5 hours at 33 DEG C, raw comprising 25mL O- acetylhomoserine
It produces and dilutes 200 times in the 250mL erlenmeyer flask of culture medium, and cultivated 30 hours under 200rpm revolving speed at 33 DEG C.It is logical
HPLC analysis measurement O- acetylhomoserine yield is crossed, as the result is shown in the following table 10. 
 [table 10] produces O- acetylhomoserine by flask culture 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 By flask culture carry out the production of O- acetylhomoserine the result shows that, KCCM11146P bacterial strain production
15.0g/L O- acetylhomoserine, and two kinds of bacterial strains of KCCM11146P-A145 and KCCM11146P-A167 are shown and reality
Apply the similar result of example<2-3>.Both bacterial strains produce 17.5g/L and 17.3g/L O- acetylhomoserine respectively, increase
About 16.7%, although it all shows that absorbance (OD) is reduced. 
 It is reduced according to TCA recycle stream caused by citrate synthase reduced activity, O- acetylhomoserine high yield bacterial strain
Display glutamate is reduced from 1.6g/L to 0g/L. 
 These are the results show that citrate synthase activity realizes production O- acetyl group Kosé ammonia by applying the modification weakened
Acid.In addition, it is also shown that when based on the O- acetylhomoserine conduct produced according to international publication number WO2008/013432
Template, and using in addition with cystathionine Gamma synthase, O- succinyl group sulfhydrylase and O- acetyl group Kosé
It, can be with simultaneously synthesizing l-methionine and acetate when the active invertase of propylhomoserin sulfhydrylase carries out conversion reaction. 
 Present inventors have shown that KCCM11146P bacterial strain, the 167th amino acids variant of citrate synthase has the O- second improved
KCCM11146P-A167 Strain Designation is " CA05-4007 " by acylhomoserine yield, and by it in November, 2013
It is preserved within 22nd International Depository Authority as defined in budapest treaty, Korean Culture Center (KCCM) (accession number: KCCM
11483P)。
