 Background technology 
 Along with the increase of world population and the raising of people's standard of living, in the U.S., Europe and the developed country such as Japanese, drop into a large amount of energy to improve dietetic life to prevent adult diseases.Therefore, the demand for fishery products continues to increase, and causes the quick growth of aquaculture production.Aquaculture industry has become the mainstay of many national economies, and in cultivation fish, breaking out of disease can cause great financial loss (JoseLuisBalcazaretal.Veter.Microbio.2006.114:173-186; Laurentvenrschuereetal.Microbio.Mot.Biol.Rev.Dec.2000.65 5-671). 
 Vibrios is a kind of pathogenic bacterium causing bacteriological infection in fish and shrimp culture field, and its subject matter produces toxicity, and secondary harm forms microbial film.That is, vibrios can produce and discharge the low-molecular-weight signaling molecule being called Autoinducer (or AI) or pheromone.The cell density of vibrios around can be identified to the detection of the lowest threshold irritating concentration of signaling molecule, thus cause the change of genetic expression and multiple physiologically active, comprise symbiosis, virulence, competence, combination, microbiotic generation, mobility, sporulation and biofilm formation (Miller, M.B.etal.Annu.Rev.Microbiol.2001.55:165-199).Therefore, the process of the population density and regulation and control related gene expression of monitoring microorganism is called quorum sensing.Quorum sensing character is present in Gram-negative and positive bacteria.When bacterium reaches sufficiently high population density, they carry out host infection with regard to changing the genetic expression needed for infecting to induce a large amount of cell cooperations, they also can hide the immune response of host, thus successfully set up infection (Dangl.J.L.etal., Nature.2001.411:826-833). 
 A typical behaviour of quorum sensing is biofilm formation.When low-density microorganism forms the bacterium colony of the colony reaching certain, the genetic expression of colony induction signaling molecule can produce mucilage polysaccharides, cause the formation of structural bio film, described microbial film participates in the bacteriological infection (Kjelleberg of 65%, S.etal.CurrOpinMicrobiol.5 (3), 2002,254-258).Microbial film is formed on host surface, causes infectious diseases.Specifically, in fish, microbial film is conducive to nutritive substance and the oxygen supply of invasive organism, stop microbiotic infiltration, blocking immunity system of defense also reduces the effect of sterilizing agent and probiotic bacterium, can also cause antibiotics resistance (Hall-Stoodley, L.etal., NatRevMicrobiol.2 (2), 2004,95-108). 
 Autoinducer-1 (AI-1) and Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) known be at the biofilm formation early interim chemical signal molecule by microorganism secretion.Autoinducer-1 is a kind of AHL compound produced by the AHL synthetic enzyme of LUX-1 family; containing fixing homoserine lactone part and the acyl group with different chain length, saturation ratio and oxidation state; such as, be N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) as the Autoinducer-1 of signaling molecule in gram negative bacterium.Autoinducer-1 is also reported as by more than a kind of strain specificity material secreted by 70 kinds of Gram-negative bacterias, described Gram-negative bacteria comprises pseudomonas (Pseudomonas), Burkholderia (Burkholderia), Yersinia (Yersinia), Aeromonas (Aeromonas), Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium), Serratia (Serratia), Erwinia (Erwinia), citrobacter (Citrobacter), enterobacteria (Enterobacter), Bacillus proteus (Proteus), pigment bacillus (Chromobacterium) and root nodule bacterium (Rhizobiumsp.) (Taga, M.E.etal.Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A. (2003)).In addition, it is reported, Autoinducer-2 is a kind of compound produced by the albumen of luxS genetic expression, there is furan boronic acid two ester structure, and a kind of universal signal (Bassler, B.L.etal.Mol.Microbiol.9 (1993) 773-786) for all existing in Gram-positive and negative bacteria.LuxS gene is present in intestinal bacteria (E.coli) and multiple thalline, such as Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonellatyphimurium), hemophilus influenzae (Hemophilusinfluenza), helicobacter pylori (Helicobacterpylori), subtilis (Bacillussubtilis), Borrelia burgdoyferi (Borreliaburgdoferi), Neisseria meningitidis (Neisseriameningitides), campylobacter jejuni (Campylobacterjejuni), mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacteriumtuberculosis), enterococcus faecalis (Enterococcusfaecalis), streptococcus pneumoniae (Streptococcuspneumoniae), clostridium perfringens (Clostridiumperfrengens), clostridium difficile (Clostridiumdifficile) and Klebsiella Pneumoniae (Klebsiellapneumoniae).Also report luxS gene is had can to bring out fluorescence in Vibrio harveyi in addition, and the genetic expression (Miller affected needed for the generation of virulence, mobility, biofilm formation and microbiotic, M.B.etal.Annu.Rev.Microbiol.55 (2001), 165-199). 
 Meanwhile, in some cases, the lethality rate in rainbow trout (Rainbowtrout) colony infecting fish invasive organism Vibrio anguillarum (Vibrioanguillarum) is 80%-100%.But, the process of the quorum sensing inhibitor furanone controlling colony induction signaling molecule AHL is utilized to control quorum sensing, thus make mortality ratio reduce to 4%-40% (Rasch, M.etal.Syst.Appl.Microbiol.27 (2004), 350-359).Therefore, much research is absorbed in colony induction signaling molecule to reduce the destruction of infected by microbes. 
 Such as, No. 641685th, United States Patent (USP) discloses a kind of antiseptic-germicide, and this antiseptic-germicide contains the photosensitizers for phototherapy, and this photosensitizers is connected to one section to Autoinducer-2(AI-2) there is the polypeptide of binding affinity, wherein said polypeptide energy kill bacteria.No. 6936453rd, United States Patent (USP) discloses and a kind ofly screens the method that can regulate and control autoinducer activity compound, the fluorescence that this fluorescence and the bacterium only contacted with Autoinducer send, by making the mixture of Autoinducer and compound and reacting with Autoinducer and the bacterial cell of luminescence contacts, then compares by it.No. 2004-0009160th, U.S. Patent Publication discloses a kind of quorum sensing inhibitor furanone, and this inhibitor is subject to the regulation and control of pathogenic bacterium signaling molecule HSL and AHL.Korean Patent discloses No. 2008-0060777 and discloses a kind of germ resistance amide derivatives being used as quorum sensing antagonist and the method using it to prevent biofilm formation.No. 832565th, Korean Patent discloses a kind of energy and is used as the antibacterial furanone derivatives of quorum sensing antagonist and uses it to prevent the method for biofilm formation.No. the 841289th, 841294 and 841333, Korean Patent disclose a kind of have anti-microbial activity can be used as simultaneously quorum sensing antagonist antibacterial homoserine lactone derivative, use this derivative remove the method for play bacterium and use the method for this derivative prevention biofilm formation. 
 Meanwhile, along with the increase of environment protection-type aquaculture demand, probiotic bacterium is used to have been widely recognized now as immunopotentiating agent.R.Fuller promoted the application of probiotic bacterium in 1989, and was formulated the microbiological feed supplement into living, and they produce Beneficial Effect by promoting host's gastrointestinal microbiological balance to host.Such as, such as the fungi of Bacterium lacticum (Lactobacillus), faecalis (Enterococcus), bifidus bacillus (Bifidobacterium) and the bacterium of genus bacillus (Bacillus) and the yeast of such as yeast (Saccharomyces) and such as aspergillus tubigensis (Aspergillus) is all used as probiotic bacterium.Probiotic bacterium is classified as GRAS (it is generally acknowledged safety (GenerallyRecognizedAsSafe)), containing the mankind or the poisonous gene of animal, and does not produce pathogenic substance.Probiotic bacterium is the microorganism going through effectively to promote the output of domestic animal.The feature of probiotic bacterium is non-virulent, be easy to in-vitro multiplication, growth and the resistance to acid and bile fast in body.In addition, probiotic activity should by the suppression of forage component, and their effect should at room temperature keep, and they should mix with feed easily. 
 Probiotic bacterium can effectively and can cause the pathogenic bacterium of intestinal tract disease to compete thus stop them to the strongly adherent of enteric epithelium, and can repair the intestinal microflora changed due to antibiotic therapy fast.In addition, probiotic bacterium can stop the infection of pathogenic micro-organism and suppress their propagation, by the propagation providing optimal conditions to promote intestinal microflora, produce lactic acid or acetic acid and form intestinal organic acids, pH value to be reduced in enteron aisle to stop the propagation of harmful pathogenic bacteria.Therefore, give the probiotic bacterium that individuality has multiple action can keep intestinal microflora and improve Livestock Production power.In aquaculture, probiotic bacterium is also added to fish feed or adds in addition in water body.Nearest research by using probiotic bacterium to improve to the immunizing power of pathogenic agent and improving water quality (JiqiuLietal.Aquaculture291 (2009) 35-40) in the aquaculture of fish or shrimps. 
 The exemplary probiotic bacterium for the biological control in aquaculture is the probiotics of such as milk-acid bacteria, faecalis and genus bacillus.Genus bacillus is Gram-positive, shaft-like, formation Endospore bacterium, and has unique form in the bacterial strain being used as probiotic bacterium.Such as the bacterial strain of subtilis (Bacillussubtilis), bacillus cereus (Bacilluscereus), Bacillus coagulans (Bacilluscoagulans), Bacillus clausii (Bacillusclausii), bacillus megaterium (Bacillusmegaterium) and Bacillus licheniformis (Bacilluslicheniformis) is used as probiotic bacterium.The heat resistance of genus bacillus is stronger than not forming endosporous milk-acid bacteria.In addition, genus bacillus can survive under the low pH of gastric shield, and therefore the genus bacillus that ingests of great majority can complete arrival small intestine (Barbosa, T.M.etal.Appl.Environ.Microbiol.71 (2005) 968-978; Spinosa, M.R.etal.Res.Microbiol.151 (2000): 61-368).Existing report utilizes genus bacillus to increase promotor as human diet supplement and animal; and in aquaculture, utilize genus bacillus to improve growth and the disease resistance of fish or shrimps; promote water quality and the shrimps speed of growth; and reduce kinds of pathogenic vibrio (Dalmin, G.etal.IndianJ.Exp.Biol39 (2001) 939-942; Wang, Y.B.etal.Fish.Sci.71 (2005) 1034-1039). 
 Present inventor has isolated probiotic bacterium from having good anti-microbial activity to the pathogenic bacteria fish and shrimps aquaculture and having in the natural resources that good digestive ferment produces, and detects the morphology of probiotic bacterium, biological chemistry and genetics characteristics.Found that isolated probiotic bacterium is the genus bacillus with good heat resistance.Particularly, this genus bacillus can control the Vibrio harveyi in aquaculture and colony induction signaling molecule Autoinducer-2 of degrading, thus suppresses the physiologically active (symbiosis, virulence, competence, biofilm formation etc.) in quorum sensing.
