    [0001]
     The present invention relates to detoxification microorganisms. More specifically, the present invention relates to bacterial isolates and methods for detoxifying mycotoxins. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   
    
    [0002]
     Approximately 25% of the world's food crops are contaminated with mycotoxins every year, creating an ongoing, serious threat to human health and food and livestock industries. Control of mycotoxins is a global challenge due to their high toxicity to animals and humans and their widespread occurrence in agricultural commodities. 
     
    
    [0003]
     Trichothecene mycotoxins represent one of the most important mycotoxin classes comprising naturally occurring metabolites produced primarily by  Fusarium  and other species of fungi ( Stachybotrys, Myrothecium , and  Trichothecium ) on a variety of cereal grains. The mycotoxins are known to be associated with several diseases in animals and humans (Ueno, 1983; Pittet, 1998; D'Mello et al., 1999; Placinta et al., 1999; DeVries et al., 2002; Conková et al., 2003; Eriksen and Pettersson, 2004; Desjardins, 2006). 
     
    
    [0004]
     Deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin) is a specific trichothecene mycotoxin which is frequently encountered in human foods. DON is associated primarily with  Fusarium graminearum  Schwabe (teleomorph  Gibberella zeae  (Schwein.) Petch.) (Nelson, 2002) and these fungi can produce DON under a wide range of conditions both in the field and post-harvest (Ramirez et al., 2006). 
     
    
    [0005]
     Control of mycotoxin contamination has been one of the major challenges facing the cereal industry. A survey conducted in Eastern Canada during 1991 to 1998 found that maize had the highest incidence of DON contaminated samples (0.1 mg/kg and over), which was 90%, followed by wheat, 82%, and barley 73%. In 2003, DON was detected in 63% of samples obtained from cereal-based infant foods from the Canadian retail market. Many outbreaks of acute human diseases have been attributed to consumption of  Fusarium —contaminated grains and, more recently, to the presence of DON at reported concentrations of 3-93 mg/kg in grain for human consumption (Canady et al., 2001). 
     
    
    [0006]
     Mycotoxin contamination of feed ingredients also has been a serious threat to livestock industry, particularly swine production. Typical acute poisoning symptoms of DON to livestock animals include weight loss, feed refusal, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea (Rotter et al., 1996; Pestka and Smolinski, 2005; Pestka, 2007). Contamination of grains with DON creates a food safety risk, a serious threat to the livestock industry, and a negative impact on international trade (Wu, 2004; Wu, 2006; Kendra and Dyer, 2007). 
     
    
    [0007]
     The current practice to reduce or contain mycotoxin contamination is focused mainly on the prevention of contaminated grain materials from entering the food chain through regulation, detection and compliance. Also, various physical and chemical decontamination techniques have been developed to reduce the concentration of DON in affected grains. For example, cleaning methods, such as gravity and sieving separation, dehulling and washing procedures can reduce the concentration of DON in wheat and maize (Trenholm et al., 1992). Thermal treatments by microwave or convection also may be used (Young, 1986). Chemical detoxification by using oxidants such as ozone (Young, 1986; Young et al., 2006), reducing reagents such as ascorbic acid, sodium bisulfite (NaHSO 3 ) and sodium metabisulfite (Na 2 S 2 O 5 ) (Swanson et al., 1984; Young et al., 1986b; Dänicke et al., 2005), and alkali such as sodium hydroxide (Young et al., 1986a) have been investigated. However, these techniques have several disadvantages, including inefficiency, residues of harmful chemicals, significant losses in nutritive value, and losses in palatability of detoxified food or feed (Karlovsky, 1999). 
     
    
    [0008]
     A variety of approaches have been used to reduce effects of mycotoxins on livestock industries. The use of adsorbents as feed additives is common. Such adsorbents may include alfalfa fiber, activated carbon, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), zeolite, organozeolite, sepiolite, clinoptilolite, bentonite, esterified glucomannan (Galvano et al., 1998; Lemke et al., 2001; Diaz et al., 2002; Tomasevic-Canovic et al., 2003). Unfortunately, the use of adsorbents in feeds to remove mycotoxins is not only relatively expensive, but also specific to particular mycotoxins. Some of the most popularly used adsorbents, such as HSCAS and sepiolite, are not effective against DON (Galvano et al., 1998). The use of grains with no or low mycotoxin contamination to dilute mycotoxin level in feed is another common approach. Furthermore, the dilution method to reduce mycotoxin contamination by mixing contaminated ingredients with high quality grains is difficult to implement because the degree of contamination is often not known and thus there are questions about the extent of dilution needed to reach contamination levels which would be considered acceptable. Some European countries have already banned the use of this procedure (Commission Regulation (EC), 2001). 
     
    
    [0009]
     Despite a plethora of information regarding the biochemistry, toxicity, and modes of action of mycotoxins, there still remain no viable solutions for either pre- or post-harvest control/eradication of these toxins (Cardwell et al., 2001). In developed countries, substantial costs are incurred through testing, compliance and research to prevent entrance of mycotoxins into the food chain. In the United States these costs are estimated to be about US$500 million to $1.5 billion per year (CAST (Council for Agricultural Science and Technology), 1989). In Canada, losses of $100 million were accrued in 1996 following a  Fusarium  epidemic in Ontario (Schaafsma, 2002). 
     
    
    [0010]
     There is a need in the art for novel products and methods for mycotoxin control and/or decontamination. Furthermore, there is a need in the art for specific, efficient and environmentally sound ways for decontamination/detoxification of mycotoxins.

    [0074]
     Mouldy corn kernels contaminated with 95 μg DON/g were mixed and ground in a Waring laboratory blender (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, ON, Canada) at high speed for 1-2 min. The corn powder was autoclaved at 121° C. for 30 min. Macroconidia of  F. graminearum  were prepared by using CMC medium (He et al., 2007). A sample of each agricultural soil (0.5 L) was mixed with above mouldy corn powder (100 g) and  F. graminearum  suspension (5 mL of 1×10 4  macroconidia/mL). The soil mixture was incubated at 28° C. and 80% relative humidity for 6 weeks. Total fifty-seven soils were enhanced with  F. graminearum -mouldy corn: fifty-five soils collected in April-May 2006, one mixture of soils collected in October-November of 2004, and one mixture of all the soils collected in 2004 and 2006. Soil, soil treated with mouldy corn, soil treated with  F. graminearum , autoclaved soil treated with mouldy corn and  F. graminearum  served as blank control, nutrient control, pathogen control and non-soil-microorganism control, respectively. 
     
    
    [0075]
     One hundred and sixty-five agricultural soils and fifty seven treated soils were screened for the ability to reduce DON. Sterile deionized water was added to soil (1:1, v/v) and the mixture was shaken at 200 rpm at room temperature (23° C.) for 4 h. A 100 μL aliquot was immediately collected from the resulting soil suspension and treated with 100  μL  1000 μg/mL DON in sterile water and 800 μL MM medium. Cultures were grown at 28° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. After incubation for 72 h, the above cultures were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described herein.

     DON-reducing activities were examined as follows: The DON-reducing soil cultures were sub-cultured in the same medium in which the DON-reducing activities were detected. Replacement of the culture with sterile water served as a blank control; an autoclaved soil suspension served as a physical absorption control; and a soil suspension filtered through a 0.22 μm mixed esters cellulose (MEC) sterile syringe filter (Fisher) served as a chemical reaction control. These controls were prepared for comparison with soil samples that had DON-reducing activities. 
     
    
    [0077]
     Different media were tested for enhanced DON-reducing activity. The DON-reducing soils were sub-cultured in MM, MMY, MMP, MMPT, CMB, and CMBPD media at 28° C. for 72 h under aerobic condition at 28° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 72 h and also under anaerobic conditions (5% H 2  and 10% CO 2  balanced N 2 ) at 23° C. for 72 h with hand-mixing every 6 h, respectively. To each individual soil sample, replacement of the soil suspension with sterile water served as a blank control; an autoclaved soil suspension served as a physical absorption control; and a soil suspension filtered through a 0.22 μm MEC sterile syringe filter (Fisher) served as chemical reaction control. 
     
    
    [0078]
     The DON-reducing soil cultures from above were serially diluted up to 10 −10  using CMB medium. Two parameters were examined; one was DON-reducing activity and the other was the population of microorganisms. For tests of DON-reducing activity, 100 μL solution from the serial was sub-cultured with DON (100 μL of 1000 μg/mL DON standard) in 800 μL CMB at 28° C. on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 72 h. Cultures were analyzed as described below. For tests of population of microorganisms, to each dilution, 100 μL solution from each serial dilution was plated on an CMA plate and incubated at 28° C. After 48-72 h incubation, the colony-forming units (CFU) were counted. These two results were combined for each serial dilution. The serial dilution showing the lowest population of microorganisms exhibiting DON reducing activity was identified and another serial dilution was made. The culture was sub-cultured and tested for DON-reducing activity as above. 
     
    
    [0079]
     The same procedure was repeated 8 times. Single colonies were picked from the agar plate corresponding to the highest dilution that still had activity of DON reduction. These colonies were sub-cultured in CMB and their activities of DON reduction were evaluated using the methods as described below.

     Extraction of DON from Culture and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis 
     
    
    [0081]
     To each 500 μL culture, 500 μL methanol was added. The mixture was allowed to stand for 2 h and filtered through a 0.45 μm polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) syringe filter (Whatman; Maidstone, Kent, UK) before being analyzed by HPLC. Identification and quantification of DON were achieved using an Agilent Technologies 1100 Series HPLC system with a Luna C18 (2) column (150×4.6 mm, 5 μm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif., USA). The binary mobile phase consisted of solvent A (methanol) and solvent B (water) and the gradient program began at 22% A, increased linearly to 41% A at 5 min, 100% A at 7 min, held 100% A from 7 to 9 min, and returned to 22% A at 11 min. There was a 2 min post-run under starting conditions for re-conditioning. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the detector was set at 218 nm. Identification of DON was achieved by comparing its retention time and UV-Vis spectra with those of a DON standard. Quantification was based on reference to a calibration curve of DON standard (He et al., 2007)

     Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Identification of DON Transformation Products 
     
    
    [0083]
     LC-MS was performed using HPLC with a Phenomenex Luna C18 (2) column (150×4.6 mm, 5 μm) coupled to a photodiode array UV detector (Finnigan MAT Spectra System UV6000LP; San Jose, Calif., USA) equipped with a Finnigan LCQ Deca atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LC-APCI-MS) operated in the positive ion mode. Detailed instrumental parameters were described before (He et al., 2007). The major product of DON transformation by bacterial strain 040408-1 was purified from the DON transformation culture using high speed countercurrent chromatography. Proton NMR spectra of DON and Compound-1 were recorded in DMSO-d 6  using Bruker Avance-400 and -600 spectrometers (Bruker BioSpin Ltd., Milton, ON, Canada). Also, H—H correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) were also recorded. The parallel nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) tests of DON and  compound  1 were conducted using a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Ltd., Milton, ON, Canada).

     Statistical Analysis of DON Reduction 
     
    
    [0096]
     Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the means were determined. Relevant reductions of DON were calculated as follows: DON reduction (%)=(C DON added −C DON residual )/C DON added ×100. All data were analyzed using SAS (SAS for Windows, Version 9.1, SAS institute, Cary, N.C., USA). A type I error rate of 0.05 was used for all analyses. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design. Differences among treatments were determined using a protected least significant difference (PLSD) test.

     Toxicity of Transformation Products of DON: Cell Culture 
     
    
    [0098]
     Human colonic carcinoma Caco-2 cells (ATCC No. HTB-37) and Swiss mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC No. CRL-1658) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) medium containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . Cells were sub-cultured weekly. The passes of 25-35 and 14-23 for Caco-2 and 3T3 cells were used, respectively. The cells were then trypsinized, diluted, added to 96-well plastic culture plates (Corning Costar®, Sigma) and incubated in DMEM containing test chemicals.

     Test of Metabolic Activity by MTT Bioassay 
     
    
    [0100]
     MTT test was applied to assess cell viability on the base of the capability of viable cells to convert soluble MTT (yellow) to purple formazan crystals. This dehydroxylation is catalyzed by enzymes in the mitochondria. Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . Caco-2 cells were pre-seeded 24 h in 96 culture plates with a density of 35,000 cells/cm 2  (0.32 cm 2 /well) by adding 100 μL 1.1×10 5  cells/mL cell suspension in DMEM medium, and then DON, 3-epi-DON and 3-keto-DON in 100 μL fresh DMEM medium were added to wells. Final concentrations ranged from 0.0100-5.00 μg/mL for DON, 1.00-1000 μg/mL for 3-epi-DON and 0.0100-10.0 μg/mL for 3-keto-DON. MTT was dissolved in PBS to make a 5 mg/mL solution, and the resulting solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm MEC sterile syringe filter (Fisher). After 48 h incubation, 25 μL MTT solution was added to each well of 96 well culture plates and incubated for additional 4 h. At the end of incubation, medium was removed, and 200 μL DMSO was added to extract the formazan. After stirring for 1 min, the absorbance was determined at 570 nm using a Powerware™ XS, Universal Microplate Spectrophotometer (BIO-TEK® Instruments Inc., Winooski, Vt., USA) (Cetin and Bullerman, 2005; Kouadio et al., 2005; Sergent et al., 2006).

     Test of DNA Synthesis Activity by a Cell Proliferation ELISA Employing BrdU Incorporation 
     
    
    [0102]
     DNA synthesis was measured by immunoassay on the basis of the incorporation of BrdU during DNA synthesis. The procedure followed the instruction manual of the cell proliferation ELISA, BrdU (colorimetric) kit (Cat. No. 1164229001, Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Quebec, Canada). 3T3 cells were pre-seeded 24 h in 96 culture plates with a density of 31,000 cells/cm 2  (0.32 cm 2 /well) by adding 100 μL 1.0×10 5  cells/mL cell suspension in DMEM medium at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 , and then DON, 3-epi-DON and 3-keto-DON in 100 μL fresh DMEM medium were added into wells. Final concentrations ranged from 0.0100-5.00 μg/mL for DON, 1.00-1000 μg/mL for 3-epi-DON and 0.0100-10.0 μg/mL for 3-keto-DON. After 24 h incubation, 20  μL  100 μmol/L BrdU labeling solution was added to each well and the culture was reincubated at 37° C. for additional 12 h. The pyrimidine analogue BrdU replaces thymidine in the DNA of reproducing cells in this labeling period. At the end of the incubation, medium was removed. Cells were fixed and the DNA was denatured by adding 200 μL/well FixDenat and incubating at room temperature (23° C.) for 30 min. Following removal of removed FixDenat, 100 μL/well antibody anti-BrdU-POD working solution was added to let the BrdU incorporate in newly synthesized cellular DNA. This incubation period was 90 min at room temperature. After removal of the reaction solution, the culture was washed with  PBS  3 times, and 100 μL substrate solution was added and incubated at room temperature for another 30 min. The absorbance was determined at 370 nm with a reference wavelength of 492 nm using a Powerware™ XS, Universal Microplate Spectrophotometer (BIO-TEK® Instruments Inc., Winooski, Vt., USA). Absorbance values correlate to the amount of DNA synthesis, and thereby to the proliferation of cells (Eriksen et al., 2004). 
     
    
    [0103]
     Mean values of the absorbance of the six replicate samples at each concentration of test chemicals were compared to the mean value of the corresponding control. Dose response curves were computer plotted (Using Sigma Plot 10.0, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, Calif., USA), and IC50 values were calculated by computer program (ProStat 4.12, Poly Software Inc., Pearl River, N.Y., USA). Data are presented as the mean of 4 independent experiments.

     Test of DON-Reduction Activity of Bacterial Strain 040408-1 in Mouldy Corn Media with Different Stickiness 
     
    
    [0105]
     To test the growth and function of bacterial strain 040408-1 in liquid culture conditions, CMB and MCMB were used. The incubations were performed under aerobic conditions at 28° C. with shaking at 200 rpm for 72 h. CMB medium (5 mL) containing 1×10 5  CFU/mL bacterial strain 040408-1 served as control; CMB medium (5 mL) containing 5×10 4  CFU/mL  F. graminearum  macroconidia served as  F. graminearum -control. Treatments were MCMB medium (5 mL) containing either bacterial strain 040408-1 or  F. graminearum  macroconidia, or both whose concentrations were same as above controls. 
     
    
    [0106]
     To test the capability of DON reduction of bacterial strain 040408-1 in suspension medium, a mixture comprising mouldy corn and bacterial strain 040408-1 in fresh CMB medium (1:9, m/v) was tested. Mouldy corn powder (2.5 g, 1.3 mg DON/g) was soaked in 20 mL fresh CMB medium for 12 h before being added to 2.5 mL of bacterial strain 040408-1 culture (1×10 9  CFU/mL). The culture was then incubated under aerobic conditions at 28° C. with shaking at 200 rpm for 72 h. 
     
    
    [0107]
     To test the capability of DON reduction of bacterial strain 040408-1 in paste medium, 2.5 g mouldy corn powder (1.3 mg DON/g) was incubated with 2.5  mL  1×10 8  CFU/mL bacterial strain 040408-1 culture under aerobic condition at 28° C. with shaking at 200 rpm for 72 h.

     Bacterial strain 040408-1 (1×10 5  CFU/mL) was cultured in CMB medium containing 100 μg/mL 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin and Roridin A at 28° C. with shaking at 200 rpm for 72 h. Cultures were extracted as described herein and analyzed using LC-MS (Finnigan MAT Spectra System UV6000LP). A Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150×4.6 mm, 3.5 μm) was used. The binary mobile phase consisted of solvent A (methanol) and solvent B (water) and the gradient program began at 25% A, increased linearly to 75% A at 15 min, 80% A at 20 min, held 80% A from 20 to 23 min, and returned to 25% A at 26 min. There was a 3 min post-run under starting conditions for re-conditioning. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and the photodiode array UV detector was set at 218 nm.

     Reduction of DON by Enriched Soils 
     
    
    [0112]
     One hundred and sixty-five agricultural soils were screened for the ability to reduce DON concentration when DON was artificially added to soil suspensions. None of the soil samples tested showed a significant reduction in DON without enrichment (data not shown). However, after enrichment, thirty-three of the fifty-seven soils demonstrated the ability to reduce DON by at least 10% (PLSD (0.05) =9.4%) (data not shown).    Soils #   17, 31, 110-1 and 165-2 were efficient soils, and reduced DON by more than 50%. These soils were selected for further study.    Soils #   11 and 21 reduced DON by only 10%, they were also chosen for further study because these soils were collected from wheat and corn fields, respectively, where  Fusarium  head blight and  Gibberella  ear rot have often occurred. Sources of these soil samples are shown in Table 1. When tested under aerobic conditions, the soil suspensions in MM medium reduced DON by about 10˜73%. However, the autoclaved suspensions (physical controls) and the filtered suspensions (chemical controls) did not reduce DON in the culture. These results suggest that the reduction of DON is due to biological activities (Table 1). 
     
    
    [0113]
     The suspensions made from the six selected soils reduced DON in one or more of MM, MMY, MMP, MMPT, CMB, and CMBPD media under aerobic conditions. DON reduction was not observed under anaerobic conditions in any of the above six media (data not shown). CMB medium was an efficient test medium tested and the DON recoveries of these six selected soils were about 0-17.6% in this medium. Therefore, CMB medium was chosen as the screening medium for DON-reducing microorganisms. 
     
    
    [0114]
     Soil enrichment of  Soil # 17 was repeated once (Table 2). DON was not reduced by either the autoclaved suspension of  Soil # 17 enhanced with  F. graminearum +corn or the cell-free filtrate of  Soil # 17 enhanced with  F. graminearum +corn. Only the soil suspensions containing living microorganisms transformed DON into different products, which suggested that the reduction of DON was due to microbial activity. DON reduction was detected in the treatments with  Soil # 17 enhanced with  F. graminearum +corn and  Soil # 17 enhanced with corn.  F. graminearum  produced DON (23.1±11.2 μg/g) in autoclaved  Soil # 17 when incubated with corn. Other results indicated that DON recovery from  Soil # 17 enhanced with corn and  F. graminearum  in CMB medium (5.2 μg/mL, Table 2) was much lower than that in MM medium (53.2 μg/mL, Table 1). This also suggested that CMB medium was suitable for use in screening for DON-reducing microorganisms.

     Isolation of Bacterial Strain 040408-1, a DON Reducing Microorganism from Soils 
     
    
    [0116]
     A white tiny colony was selected after eight times of concurrent purification on the base of nutrient selection and stepwise decontamination. Its source was a treated soil that was originally collected from an alfalfa field in 2006. The resulting 16S rRNA gene from bacterial strain 040408-1 had 97-94% sequence similarity to certain strains (Table 10). 
     
    
    [0117]
     It converted DON to one major product (3-epi-DON) and two minor products (Peak 5.0 and 3-keto-DON). The production of 3-epi-DON and the disappearance of DON were coincident (see  FIG. 1 ). 
     
    
    [0118]
     Physiological Characterization of Bacterial Strain 040408-1 for DON Reduction 
     
    
    [0119]
     During incubation in CMB at 28° C. without shaking, the growth and function of bacterial strain 040408-1 were not inhibited, but delayed by 12-24 h compared to those with shaking at 200 rpm ( FIG. 2 ). The coincidence of the growth of bacterial strain 040408-1 and the reduction of DON as previously described ( FIG. 1 ) was observed as well. 
     
    
    [0120]
     There was no reduction of DON by bacterial strain 040408-1 detected after 72 h incubations in CMB medium under anaerobic condition at both 23 and 37° C. Growth rate and DON reduction experiments were also conducted in CMB medium under aerobic conditions at 28° C. Results indicated that bacterial strain 040408-1 was capable of growth in the presence of various concentrations of DON ( FIG. 3 ). However, DON reduction activity was inhibited in the presence of very high concentrations of DON in CMB medium ( FIG. 4 ). 
     
    
    [0121]
     As will be understood by a person of skill in the art, temperatures also affect the growth and function of bacterial strain 040408-1 as shown in  FIG. 5 . The experimental results suggest that efficient incubation reaction conditions were about 28° C. However, temperatures between about 4° C. and about 37° C. were also shown to be capable of reducing DON. Accordingly, the present invention preferably contemplates the use of bacterial strain 040408-1 to reduce DON at a temperature of between about 15° C. and about 37° C., for example, but not limited to 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 37° C. or any temperature therein between. However, in still further embodiments, the present invention contemplates the use of bacterial strain 040408-1 at temperatures higher than 37° C. or lower than 15° C. 
     
    
    [0122]
     Effect of inoculation was determined using CMB cultures containing 100 μg/mL DON and bacterial strain 040408-1 with inoculation concentrations from 1×10 0  up to 5×10 9  CFU/mL at 28° C. with shaking at 200 rpm for 72 h. The coincidence of the growth of bacterial strain 040408-1 and the reduction of DON was also observed in each treatment (data not shown). At 72 h, DON concentrations were reduced to about 3.8-10.0 μg/mL (PLSD (0.05) =9.4 μg/mL) in treatments with concentrations of inoculation ranging from 1×10 4  to 1×10 8  CFU/mL ( FIG. 6 ). DON concentrations of treatments with inoculation concentrations of 1×10 0 , 1×10 1 , 1×10 2  and 1×10 3  CFU/mL were reduced to below 10 μg/mL with continuous incubation (data not shown). 
     
    
    [0123]
     MM, MMY, MM-Purdue, Yeast+Glucose, BYE are media that are frequently used in the research of bacterial enzymes (Shima et al., 1997; Young et al., 2007). CMB, CMBPD were found to be suitable for screening DON-reducing microorganisms. CMB/WO/Salt, rice medium, malt extract are media that have similar nutrients to CMB. Nutrient broth, TSB, Lauria Bertani and MacConkey are common media for bacteria. Therefore, these media were then chosen for testing the growth and the function of bacterial strain 040408-1 in a culture condition of: 100 μg/mL DON, at 28° C., with shaking at 200 rpm for 72 h. Media CMB and Yeast+glucose gave lowest residue concentrations of DON in all these media, which were 4.5 and 0.0 μg/mL, respectively. 3-epi-DON was the major and consequent product of the reaction. Peak 5.0 and 3-keto-DON were found in certain media and their concentrations were low (about 5 μg/mL (Table 3).

     Transformation Products of DON by Enriched Soils and Bacterial Strain 040408-1 
     
    
    [0125]
     Soils in different media showed different DON reduction activities and gave different profiles of DON transformation products. A total of seven different transformation products of DON were found. They were named as Peaks 4.2, 5.0, 5.2, 5.9, 6.3, 7.2, 7.9, and 8.3, corresponding to their retention times in minutes. Different soils gave similar profiles of DON transformation products in the same medium. For example, in MM medium, the activities of DON transformation were generally low and the DON recoveries ranged from 24.5-93.7% under the conditions tested. The major transformation products were observed as peaks at the following retention times: 4.2, 5.0, and 7.9 min ( FIG. 7 ). In CMB medium, the DON transformation activities were much higher than those in MM medium and the DON recoveries were between about 0-17.6%. The products showed peaks at 4.2, 6.3 and 8.3 min ( FIG. 8 ). The profile of DON transformation in CMBPD medium was similar to that in CMB medium. However, a same soil was capable of transforming DON into different products in different media.  FIG. 9  shows the HPLC chromatographs of transformation products of DON by the soil #165-2 in six different media. 
     
    
    [0126]
     The major product of DON transformation by bacterial strain 040408-1 was purified from the DON transformation culture using high speed countercurrent chromatography and identified as 3-epi-DON using NMR. Peak 5.9 has the same MW as DOM-1. The identities of the products eluting at 7.2 and 7.9 min were confirmed as DOM-1 and 3-keto-DON, respectively, by matching the retention time and UV and MS spectral data (Shima et al., 1997; Young et al., 2007).

     Cytotoxicity of the Two Major Transformation Products of DON 
     
    
    [0128]
     The cytotoxicity of DON, 3-epi-DON and 3-keto-DON was measured by MTT and BrdU bioassays in a concentration range from 0.0100-5.00 μg/mL (0.0338-16.9 mmol/L), 1.00-1000 μg/mL (3.38-3378 mmol/L) and 0.0100-10.0 μg/mL (0.0340-34.0 mmol/L). All tested compounds had a clear response to concentration in these two assays ( FIGS. 10 and 11 ). The values of IC 50  and their relative values to DON were presented in Table 4. The IC 50  values of 3-epi-DON and 3-keto-DON were 357 and 3.03 times higher than that of DON on the base of the MTT bioassay and were 1181 and 4.54 times higher than that of DON on the basis of the BrdU bioassay.

     The Capability of Bacterial Strain 040408-1 to Transform Other Trichothecenes 
     
    
    [0130]
     Bacterial strain 040408-1 was able to transform 3-acetyl-DON (MW=338, t R =7.9 min) into four products with molecular weights (MW) of 296 (t R =3.0 min), 308 (t R =3.7 min), 308 (t R =3.9 min) and 308 (t R =6.4 min), 15-acetyl-DON (MW=338, t R =7.8 min) into two products with MW of 338 (t R =6.7 min) and 368 (t R =8.1 min), Roridin A (MW=532, t R =16.4) into two products with MW of 530, t R =14.7 and 502, t R =16.0).

 Toxicity of Transformation Products of DON in an Animal Model 
   
    
    [0131]
     Female B6C3FI mice were obtained from Charles River Canada Inc (Montreal, Canada). Mice were housed in pairs in plastic cages under conditions meeting the requirements of the Canadian Council for Animal Care and were acclimatized for one week before the start of the study. 2014 Teklad Global 14% Protein Rodent Maintenance Diet (Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Quebec, Canada) and water were provided ad libitum before and throughout the study. 
     
    
    [0132]
     The experiment included 10 mice per group for each of the following treatments: Control (solvent control, free of toxin); 2 mg/kg DON; 25 mg/kg 3-epi-DON, and 100 mg/kg 3-epi-DON. There were no significant differences in starting body weights for any of the groups studied (P>0.05). Each mouse received a single daily gavage dose with a 20-gauge stainless-steel gavage needles (Popper and Sons, Inc., New Hyde Park, N.Y., USA) for 14 consecutive days. Body weights were monitored daily throughout the study. The food consumption was measured every 3 or 4 days. On the final day of the study, all mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (Aerrane®, Anaquest, Ontario, Canada) and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Organ weights were recorded for heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, and thymus.

     Toxicological Effects on Mouse Organs of 3-Epi-DON 
     
    
    [0134]
     All mice were healthy in appearance and demeanour for the duration of the study. On the day of necropsy, final body weights of mice in the treatment of 2 mg/kg DON appeared lower than those of Control, 25 mg/kg 3-epi-DON, and 100 mg/kg 3-epi-DON treatments (P=0.095) (Table 5). All tested organ weights were expressed relative to body weights. Heart weights were not significantly different among the four treatments at the time of necropsy (P=0.111). Spleen weights of mice in the treatment of 2 mg/kg DON appeared lower than those of other three treatments (P=0.094). Weights of liver (P<0.001), kidney (P<0.001) and thymus (P<0.001) of mice in 2 mg/kg DON treatment were significantly lower than those of Control. However, there were no significant difference among the Control and the two 3-epi-DON treatments at 25 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively, in weights of liver, kidney, spleen and thymus (Table 5). 
   Example 3 
 Calibration Curve and Preparation of Inoculum 
   
    
    [0135]
     An initial calibration curve of 040408-1 was made using a dilution plating technique and turbidity measurements. Bacterial isolate 040408-1 from pure culture was grown on 1 ml of CMB on a rotary shaker at 28° C. for 24 h with shaking at 200 rpm. From this original suspension, serial two-fold dilutions were made and optical density (OD) readings performed at 620 nm for each resulting suspension using a Ultrospec 3100 Pro UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) until OD was approximately 0.10. Additionally, each new suspension was used to make a 10-fold dilution series up to 10 −3 , from which 100 μL of supernatant was inoculated and spread onto corn meal agar plates. The plates were incubated in the dark at 28° C. for 3 days and the number of forming colonies units per millilitre (CFU mL −1 ) was determined by plate counting and the number of CFU for each two fold-dilution was extrapolated. The calibration curve was then plotted using the number of CFU mL −1  vs the OD readings. 
     
    
    [0136]
     Bacterial isolate 040408-1 from original plates was incubated for 24 h at 28° C. in CMB and diluted in autoclaved water to  ca  10 6  CFU mL −1 , was used as the inoculum. All test microbial cultures were spiked with DON solution dissolved in water to a final concentration of 50 mg L −1 . 
     
    
    [0137]
     Chemicals 
     
    
    [0138]
     Deoxynivalenol standard was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.); all solvents were LC-grade (Caledon Labs Ltd, Georgetown, ON, Canada). Mineral and media ingredients were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, N.J., USA), Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo., USA), Becton, Dickinson and Company (Le Pont de Claix-Cedex, France) or Fluka Chemie (Buchs, Switzerland). 
     
    
    [0139]
     Assessment of Culture Conditions 
     
    
    [0140]
     Culture conditions including incubation temperature and medium pH were examined to determine their effects on bacterial growth and DON-biotransforming activity. The effect of incubation temperature was examined by incubating bacteria in CMB at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40° C. for 48 h under aerobic conditions. Aliquots of CMB were adjusted to pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 with NaOH or HCl 1N before sterilization to examine the effect of starting pH. After inoculation with the test organism and under aerobic conditions, microbial cultures were incubated at 28° C. with shaking (200 rpm) for 48 h. Growth and DON biotransformation were then determined. CMB was prepared according to previous experiments (Example 1). Corn meal (40 g) was soaked for approximately 4 h in 1 l of deionized water. Before filtering, minerals were added including (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 3 g; K 2 HPO 4 , 1.0 g; MgSO 4 , 0.5 g; K 2 SO 4 , 0.5 g; FeSO 4 , 0.1 g; MnSO 4 , 0.07 g and yeast extract, 5 g. 
     
    
    [0141]
     Assessment of Culture Media 
     
    
    [0142]
     To examine the effect of media components on bacterial growth and DON-biotransforming activity, different carbon and nitrogen sources, with and without the addition of minerals were evaluated. The carbon sources tested were glucose (GLU) (a monosaccharide), sucrose (SUC) (a disaccharide), and corn starch (STA) (a polysaccharide). The nitrogen sources used were of two types: organic sources, which included corn steep liquor (CSL), peptone (PEP), yeast extract (YEA), and urea (URE); and the inorganic sources ammonium sulphate (SUL) and ammonium nitrate (NIT). The concentration of the carbon and nitrogen sources was 10 g L −1 . The minerals used and their concentration per liter of distilled water were the same as above. As shown in Table 6, 18 different media were evaluated and CMB was used as a reference control. All media were homogenized and autoclaved at 121° C. for 15 min. After inoculation with the test organism, microbial solutions were incubated under aerobic conditions at 28° C. with shaking (200 rpm) for 72 h. Growth and DON biotransformation in microbial cultures were then determined. 
     
    
    [0143]
     Preparation of Samples for Bacterial Growth and DON Biotransformation Determination 
     
    
    [0144]
     After incubation, optical density (OD) readings were performed at 620 nm using a Ultrospec 3100 Pro UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK) on each sample to establish the bacterial growth using a calibration curve previously established. The solution was mixed with methanol at 2:1 ratio using a vortexer for 1 minute and let stand for 2 minutes. The final solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes, filtrated using a 0.45 mm pore size membrane filter immediately before DON analysis by LC/MS. 
     
    
    [0145]
     Analysis of DON and Metabolites by LC/MS 
     
    
    [0146]
     For  DON analysis  20 μL of sample was injected onto a 4.6×150 mm LC column packed with Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18, 3.5 μm particle size. The column was eluted at 1 mL/min with a gradient of methanol-water changing from 25% methanol to 41% over 5 min, held at 41% for 3 min, then back to 25% over 1 min and held at 25% for 3 min. Starting materials and products were detected with a Finnigan Spectra System UV6000LP ultraviolet (UV) detector and a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap MS operated in the positive ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mode. The mass spectrometer was tuned for maximum response for DON. Machine operating conditions were as follows: shear gas and auxiliary flow rates were set at 80 and 0 (arbitrary units); voltages on the capillary, tube lens offset,  multipole  1 offset,  multipole  2 offset, lens, and entrance lens were set at 15.00, 30.00, −5.00, −7.00, −16.00, and −60.00 V, respectively; capillary and vaporizer temperatures were set at 200° C. and 450° C., respectively; and the discharge needle current was set at 10 μA. Identities of compounds were confirmed by the congruence of retention times and UV and MS spectral data with those of authentic standards. DON, 3-epi-DON and 3-keto-DON were quantified on the basis of integrated peak areas using MS selected ion monitoring (SIM) at m/z 231, 249, 267, 279, and 297 for DON and 3-epi-DON and m/z 247, 261, 277, and 295 for 3-keto-DON. It was assumed that the molar response factor for each metabolite was equal to that of DON. The percentage of DON biotransformation was estimated by subtracting the remaining DON after incubation from the initial concentration, multiplied×100. 
     
    
    [0147]
     Rate of DON Biotransformation 
     
    
    [0148]
     Bacterial isolate 040408-1 suspended in CMB (106 CFU mL −1 ) was spiked with 50 mg L −1  DON and incubated at 28° C. under aerobic conditions at 200 rpm. Samples of the microbial culture were taken every 12 hours during a period of 48 h to determine changes in concentrations of DON and metabolites produced. 
     
    
    [0149]
     Statistical Analysis 
     
    
    [0150]
     Each experiment was conducted in duplicate with at least a triplicate determination for each sample. The experimental design was completely randomized and the effect of the different media was determined by one-way ANOVA using Statistix® for Windows version 2.0. Variable means from treatments showing significant differences in the ANOVA were compared using the Tukey's test (P<0.05). 
     
    
    [0151]
     Effect of Temperature 
     
    
    [0152]
     Table 7 shows the growth and DON biotransformation by bacterial isolate 040408-1 at various culture temperatures in CMB. The highest 040408-1 growth (P<0.05) was observed in CMB at temperatures of 30 and 35° C. followed by 25 and 20° C. These four groups also showed good DON biotransformation rates (P<0.05). As the cultivation temperature decreased from 20 to 5° C., growth of the test organism was slower and little DON biotransformation was observed, whereas at 40° C., even though the production of biomass was significant (P=0.05), little DON biotransforming activity was detected. 
     
    
    [0153]
     Effect of pH 
     
    
    [0154]
     As shown in Table 8, among the various pH's tested, growth of bacterial isolate 040408-1 was substantial (over 1.0×10 9  CFU mL −1 ) in media with an initial pH between 6.0 and 7.1 (P<0.05). The bacteria showed little or no appreciable growth in media with an initial pH of 3.0, 4.2 or 5.2, while at pH of 8.4, 9.3 and 10.2, although the growth increased, it was not significantly different (P<0.05) from that observed at lower pH's. Adjusting the initial pH of the culture broth to 7.1 resulted in substantial DON biotransforming activity by 040408-1 (95.1%) followed by the activity at pH 6.0 and 8.4 (77.5% and 37.8 respectively). Little or no DON biotransformation was detected in media having an initial pH of 3.0, 4.2, 5.2, 9.3 and 10.2 (P<0.05). 
     
    
    [0155]
     Effect of Nutrients in Culture Media 
     
    
    [0156]
     Table 9 shows the growth and the percentage of DON biotransformation of the bacterial isolate 72 h after its culture in media containing various carbon and nitrogen sources with and without minerals added. When no minerals were added to test media, the highest growth of 040408-1 was obtained with YEA (5.3×10 9  CFU mL −1 ) followed by CSL and PEP. No differences were found between GLU, SUC, STA, URE, SUL or NIT (P<0.05), and the final concentration was lower than 1.6×10 7  CFU mL −1  in all cases. The highest DON biotransforming activity (87.7%) was detected when YEA was used as media while almost no DON biotransformation was detected when GLU, SUC, STA, URE, SUL and NIT were used with less than 1.5% in all cases. DON biotransforming activity was also observed with PEP and CSL with values of 49.3% and 17.1%, respectively. As expected, CMB showed significantly higher values on both growth and DON biotransformation (7.7×10 9  CFU ml −1  and 97.8 respectively). 
     
    
    [0157]
     When minerals were added to media, YEA yielded the highest growth of bacterial isolate 040408-1 (8.7×10 9  CFU mL −1 ), followed by CSL and PEP. STA, URE, SUL and NIT showed the lowest growth rates with values below 9.9×10 6  CFU mL −1 , while GLU and SUC showed higher values with 1.2 and 4.0×10 7  CFU mL −1 , respectively. In regards to DON biotransformation, CSL, PEP and YEA exhibited higher percentages (99.5%, 99.2% and 84.4% respectively) compared to the values obtained when GLU, SUC, STA, URE, SUL and NIT were used as test media (P<0.05). 
     
    
    [0158]
       FIGS. 12A and 12B  compare growth and DON biotransformation between media with and without minerals. Addition of minerals had no significant effect on bacterial growth, while in DON biotransformation only CSL showed a significant (P<0.05) improvement with the addition of minerals (from 17.1 to 99.5%). 
     
    
    [0159]
     Profiles reflecting the amount (in percentage) of reaction products obtained from DON biotransformation for media CSL, PEP, YEA supplemented with minerals, and CMB are shown in  FIG. 13 . After 72 h of incubation, DON was converted (99%) to metabolites (except in YEA media). As expected the two already known major metabolites 3-epi-DON (DON steroisomer) and 3-keto-DON were identified in all samples. The main product of the biotransformation was 3-epi-DON with more than 72% in all cases while the 3-keto-DON metabolite amounted to 10% or less. An unknown compound was also detected, especially in CMB medium where the percentage was as high as 17%. Fragments observed in the mass spectrum of the compound included m/z 247, 277, 291 and 309 (molecular weight of the compound is 308 Da). Although differences in the profiles were observed on DON, 3-keto-DON and unknown compounds, no significant differences were found in the percentages of 3-epi-DON at p=0.05 level. 
     
    
    [0160]
       FIG. 14  shows the changes in levels of DON and biotransformation products over an incubation time of 48 h at 28° C. in CMB with minerals added. As observed in the DON biotransformation curve, the level of 3-epi-DON progressively increased linearly with time and DON was biotransformed to products after 36 hours hr. The unknown metabolites as well as 3-keto-DON reached maximum levels at 24 h under the conditions tested but tended to diminish by 48 h.

   a Original soil samples of soil #11, 17, 21, 31, 110-1 and 165-2 stored at 4° C. served as the soil samples without enrichment.        Soil #       11, 17, 21, 31, 110-1 and 165-2 incubated with  F. graminearum  + infested corn at 28° C. for 6 weeks served as soils with enrichment. 
 
 
   b After cultured with soil suspension, autoclaved soil suspension and filtered cell-free soil suspension in MM medium, DON was added to each culture to make the final concentration as 100 μg/mL. The cultures were incubated at 28° C. for 3 d under aerobic condition. 
 
 
   c Reduction of DON concentration was computed as (100 − Concentration of DON in culture)/Concentration of DON in culture × 100%. 
 
 
   d Values of PLSD of the concentration of DON in culture (μg/mL) and Reduction of DON concentration (%) were the same.
