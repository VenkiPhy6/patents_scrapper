 2, experimental result 
 (1) fixation experiment result 
 Spray control formation of the sand table surface without skinning of tap water；The experiment sand table surface of sprinkling bacterium solution forms about
The skinning cortex of 6mm, the test result show using Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 bacterium solutions be sprayed at drift sand surface can play fix the sand,
Prevent the effect of drift sand surface active. 
 (2) it is retained test effect 
 Referring to attached drawing 2.10 are placed under conditions of the experiment sand table of sprinkling bacterium solution and 25 DEG C of the control sand table of sprinkling tap water
It, measures its soil moisture content, the results showed that, although experimental group and control group have the loss of moisture, with prolonging for time
The speed ratio control group of the loss of long test group moisture is slow, and after especially 8d, control group water loss rate increases rapidly, therefore
There is certain water retention using bacterium solution sprinkling drift sand surface. 
 (3) keep a full stand of seedings test effect 
 Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 bacterium solutions are sprayed at the test effect of keeping a full stand of seedings on drift sand surface.It waits emerging, sprays various concentration
The 7th day after bacterium solution, oneself was slowly die due to arid again through unearthed seedling is most of.But, it is apparent that spray
The seedling survival number of days of watering is most short, dies an death most soon, and the seedling survival number of days for spraying Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 bacterium solutions is longer,
Die an death relatively slow, but to be not the longer therefore suitable bacterial concentration of number of days of the higher seedling survival of bacterial concentration can play one
Fixed seedling protecting effect. 
 As it can be seen that in the Oligotrophic bacteria Bacillus sp.DOB153CGMCC NO.11926 bacterium solution shapes of drift sand surface sprinkling

 1, experimentation 
 After scribing line activates repeatedly on LB culture mediums by Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153, it to be used for the preparation of liquid bacterial agent, inoculation
35 DEG C of shaking flask culture 60h of postposition, prepare Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 microbial inoculums. 
 It selects the shifting sand area of 2 5m × 5m as test plot on the innerland of ancient capital Xi'an, is arranged at 2
Reason is sprayed Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 microbial inoculums and is not sprayed, the latter is control.Acquired respectively after 1 month each sample prescription 0-2cm and
2-5cm soil samples carry out microbial populations in soil quantity, soil enzyme activities, the adaptability to environment, the measurement of cryptogam, each
Soil sample is all provided with 3 repetitions. 
 2, experimental result 
 (1) influence that sprinkling Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 microbial inoculums are distributed different soil major microorganisms 
 Experimental result is shown in Table 1, and the application of Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 microbial inoculums affects the number of the original microbe groups of soil
Measure feature.Each soil layer is compareed, after spraying Oligotrophic bacteria microbial inoculum, all kinds of micro organism quantities have obvious increase.To bacterium
For, control sample 0-2cm layers of bacterial number significantly less than 2-5cm soil layers, and spray Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 microbial inoculums
In sample ground, the regularity of distribution of bacterium shows as surface layer and is more than time surface layer, and 0-2cm layers of bacterial number is significantly higher than control.
After spraying Oligotrophic bacteria, the fungi of each soil layer and unwrapping wire, bacterium number amount increased.In Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 microbial inoculums
After Oligotrophic bacteria DOB153 enters soil, certain facilitation is played to the growth and breeding of other microorganisms, to soil
The raising of microbial activity has certain help.
