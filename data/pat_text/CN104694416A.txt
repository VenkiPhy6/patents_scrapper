 3. invention also provides a kind of plant growth-promoting bacteria preparation of resistance to heavy metal and the application thereof that contain the above bacterial strain, described growth-promoting bacteria preparation is liquid preparation, living bacteria count amount containing the above bacterial strain in preparation is 10-15 hundred million/milliliter, application method described plant growth-promoting bacteria dilution agent 200 times is soaked plant seed sow after 1 hour, and under promoting heavy metal stress, plant normal growth is grown. 
 Advantage of the present invention and positively effect: 
 Bacterial strain D414 of the present invention has various heavy (lead, cadmium, copper, zinc) tolerance, and can produce plant growth hormones IAA, fixed nitrogen, dissolves insoluble inorganic phosphate, can alleviate heavy metallic poison and significantly improve inoculation phytomass.Its concrete function is as follows: 
 1. the discovery of heavy-metal contaminated soil plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria novel species 
 There is the surprising microbial population of value volume and range of product in rhizosphere soil and (have 4,000 ~ 10 in every gram of soil, 000 kind of prokaryotic micro-organisms, sum about 2 × 10
         9 individual), they and root system of plant and Zinc fractions special soil microenvironment are most important biotic factors in plant rhizosphere soil.Wherein only have an appointment less than 10% known to the mankind.Therefore, 1) separation screening beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms novel species can enrich our understanding to the surprising microcosm of this value volume and range of product; 2) by these microorganism novel species physiological characteristics of research, China's secure agricultural production technology can be promoted, contribute to promoting China's farmland pollution recovery technique level.
       
 2. plant growth-promoting characteristic 
 Heavy metal contamination farmland often embodies, and soil quality declines, the features such as crop nutrition content utilization ratio is low.Bacterial strain D414 of the present invention has stronger insoluble inorganic phosphate solubilising, can promote that host crop is to the absorption and use efficiency of inorganic nutritive element as phosphorus, potassium, promote crop root growth by generation plant hormone IAA and associative nitrogen fixation simultaneously, increase root absorbing area, thus promote crop growth. 
 3. alleviate plant heavy metallic poison 
 The murder by poisoning of heavy metal element to plant is embodied in ethylene content in plant materials and raises, and higher concentration ethene significantly can suppress plant cell division, negative regulation plant-growth, and plant-growth finally can be caused to be subject to obvious suppression.1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is significant for regulating plant body ethylene concentration as ethylene synthase precursor substance.Of the present invention, bacterial strain D414 can produce 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) desaminase, degrading ethylene precursor substance ACC, reduces ethylene content in plant materials, thus alleviation heavy metallic poison, improve the resistance of plant in Heavy-metal Polluted Environment.
