[Background Art] D-Psicose-3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.30) and D-tagatose-3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.31) are known as enzymes that catalyze the 3-epimerization of D-fructose to produce D-psicose. When D-psicose is produced through a single enzymatic reaction using the enzyme, reaction equilibrium between the substrate (i.e., D-fructose) and the product (i.e., D-psicose) exists at a constant level (product/substrate = appropriately 20-35%). Thus, the production of high-purity D-psicose requires an additional process for separating and removing a relatively high concentration of D-fructose from the enzymatic reaction product. Additionally, fructose is a relatively expensive raw material compared to starch or glucose, and when fructose is used as a raw material, the cost ratio of psicose and tagatose increases. Accordingly, various studies on the production of allulose and tagatose through a reaction using starch or glucose, which is relatively economical raw material, have been reported (KR 10-2018-0004023, WO 2018-112139, WO 2017-059278, WO 2018-129275). Meanwhile, Chan et al. (2008. Biochemistry. 47:9608-9617) reported D-ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1) derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and D-psicose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.-) derived from E. coli capable of catalyzing the 3-epimerization of D-fructose-6-phosphate and D-psicose-6-phosphate.       However, these enzymes are not industrially applicable due to poor thermal resistance. [Disclosure] [Technical Problem] Under such circumstances, the present inventors have earnestly conducted research to Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 develop a method for increasing the conversion rate of allulose on an industrial scale in an economical manner. As a result, the present inventors have found that after sucrose or starch (e.g., maltodextrin) as an inexpensive raw material is converted to psicose-6-phosphate, the use of the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application, which is specific to psicose-6-phosphate and participates in an irreversible reaction pathway, enables the production of psicose through one-pot enzymatic conversions using a plurality of enzymes involved in the psicose production pathways and can significantly increase the rate of conversion to psicose.  Accordingly, the present application has been accomplished based on this finding. The enzyme of the present application has better advantages in the production of psicose compared to the conventionally known psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase (Panoramic view of a superfamily of phosphatases through substrate profiling, PNAS, 06.04. 2015, Huang, etc.). [Technical Solution] It is one object of the present application to provide a psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase. It is another object of the present application to provide a nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase. It is still another object of the present application to provide a transformant including the nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase. It is yet another object of the present application to provide a composition for producing psicose, including the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase, a microorganism expressing the same, or a culture of the microorganism. It is even another object of the present application to provide a method for producing psicose, including converting psicose-6-phosphate into psicose by bringing psicose-6-phosphate into contact with the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase, a microorganism expressing the same, or a culture of the microorganism. [Advantageous Effects] The novel enzymes and combination thereof of the present application are thermoresistant, and accordingly, the enzyme of the present application can participate in the pathway for the conversion of psicose-6-phosphate to psicose in an industrial manner, allows the progression of the pathway for the synthesis of psicose from glucose or starch (e.g., maltodextrin) as an inexpensive raw material, and enables the production of psicose through the dephosphorylation of psicose-6-phosphate, an irreversible reaction pathway, thereby significantly increasing the rate of  
 2 Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 conversion to psicose. Thermoresistant enzymes can commercially prevent microorganisms and easily react with high-concentration substrates, and thus their effects are prominent. In addition, the production method of the present application can simplify or eliminate the separation and purification process, including the high concentration of the reaction product (i.e., psicose) by the increase in the conversion rate of psicose, and thus there is an economic advantage, while allowing a simple production method. In particular, separation using SMB can be minimized or eliminated, thus maximizing separation efficiency and yield.

As used herein, the "psicose-6-phosphate" is known as allulose-6-phosphate, and the "psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase" is an enzyme that catalyzes the production of psicose by dephosphorylating the phosphate group of psicose-6-phosphate. The psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application can be used to produce psicose with high efficiency in combination with starch-processing enzymes and sugar phosphate¨ converting enzymes, in the preparation of psicose by decomposing high-concentration starch. The psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application may have an amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222, or may include an amino acid sequence having a  
 4 Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 homology of at least 70% to the amino acid sequence. Additionally, it may have an amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 6, 9, 12, 26, 29, 38 to 43, 45 to 53, 56, 57, 59, 60, 64 to 66, 69, 70, 72, 76, 80, 81, 91 to 93, 95, 99 to 103, 113, 114, 116, 117, 131, 134, 136, 142, 145, 146, 148, 164, 167, 169, 172, 177, 184 to 187, 189, 191, 192, 211, 217, and 221, or may include an amino acid sequence having a homology of at least 70% to the amino acid sequence. More specifically, it may have an amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID  NOS: 26, 29, 53, 56, 60, 70, 76, 80, 81, 116, 117, 131, 134, 145, 167, 185, 186, and 191, or may include an amino acid sequence having a homology of at least 70% to the amino acid sequence, but is not limited thereto. Further, any sequences having the same activity as the amino acid sequence may be included without limitation. In addition, it may include an amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222 or an amino acid sequence having at least 80% homology or identity thereto, but is not limited thereto. Specifically, the amino acid may include an amino acid having at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% homology or identity thereto. Furthermore, it is apparent that any protein having an amino acid sequence, in which part of the amino acid sequence is deleted, modified, substituted, or added, may also fall within the scope of the present application as long as it includes an amino acid sequence having such a homology or identity and exhibiting an effect corresponding to that of the above protein. That is, in the present application, although it is described as ``a protein having an amino acid sequence of a particular SEQ ID NO", it is apparent that any protein, in which part of the amino acid sequence is deleted, modified, substituted, conservatively substituted, or added, may also be used in the present application as long as the protein has the same or corresponding activity to the protein composed of the amino acid sequence of the corresponding SEQ ID NO.  For example, as long as a protein has activity identical or corresponding to that of the enzyme, addition of a sequence that does not alter the function of the protein upstream and downstream of the amino acid sequence, naturally occurring mutations, silent mutations, or conservative substitutions thereof are not excluded. It is apparent that even though the protein has such a sequence addition or mutation, it falls within the scope of the present application. As used herein, the term ``homology" or -identity" refers to a degree of relatedness between two given amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences, and may be expressed as a percentage.   Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 The terms homology and identity may often be used interchangeably with each other. The sequence homology or identity of the conserved polynucleotide or polypeptide may be determined using standard alignment algorithms, and may be used with default gap penalties established by the program being used. Substantially, homologous or identical sequences may hybridize under moderately or highly stringent conditions such that the full length of the sequence or at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% or more of the full length may hybridize.  Polynucleotides that contain degenerate codons instead of codons in hybridizing polynucleotides are also considered. Whether any two polynucleotide sequences have homology, similarity, or identity may be, for example, determined by a known computer algorithm such as the -FASTA"  program (Pearson et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2444) using default parameters.  Alternatively, it may be deterniined by the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol.  Biol. 48: 443-453), which is performed using the Needleman program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16:276-277) (preferably, version 5Ø0 or versions thereafter) (GCG  program package (Devereux, J. et al., Nucleic Acids Research 12:387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA  (Atschul, S. F. et al., J MOLEC BIOL 215:403 (1990); Guide to Huge Computers, Martin J.  Bishop, ed., Academic Press, San Diego, 1994; and CARILLO et al. (1988) SIAM J  Applied Math 48:1073). For example, the homology, similarity, or identity may be determined using BLAST  or ClustalW of the National Center for Biotechnology Inforniation (NCBI). The homology, similarity, or identity of polynucleotides or polypeptides may be determined by comparing sequence information using, for example, the GAP  computer program, such as Needleman et al. (1970), J Mol Biol. 48:443 as disclosed in Smith and Waterman, Adv.  AppL Math (1981) 2:482. In summary, the GAP program defines the homology, similarity, or identity as the value obtained by dividing the number of similarly aligned symbols (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) by the total number of the symbols in the shorter of the two sequences.  Default parameters for the GAP program may include (1) a unary comparison matrix (containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non-identities) and the weighted comparison matrix of Gribskov et al. (1986), Nucl. Acids Res. 14:6745, as disclosed in Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, pp. 353-358 (1979) (or EDNAFULL substitution matrix (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4)); (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap (or a gap opening Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.5); and (3) no penalty for end gaps. Therefore, as used herein, the term -homology" or -identity" represents relatedness between sequences. The psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application may be an enzyme that selectively catalyzes the dephosphorylation of psicose-6-phosphate.        Specifically, the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase may be an enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of psicose-6-phosphate when it is mixed with glucose- 1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, or fructose-6-phosphate. For example, when the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase is mixed with the                                                                       same amount of psicose-6-phosphate, glucose- 1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate, the dephosphorylation rate of psicose-6-phosphate is 1%  or more, 10% or more, or 30% or more. Due to the selective activity of the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application, a high rate of psicose conversion can be exhibited in one-pot enzymatic conversion using a plurality of enzymes and substrates at the same time. The psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application may be produced by transforming a strain with the enzyme itself or DNA expressing the enzyme, culturing the transformed strain to obtain a culture, and disrupting the culture, followed by purification via column chromatography.                                                    The strain for transformation may be Escherichia coil, Corynebacterum glutamicum, Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia pastoris, or Bacillus subtilis, but is not limited thereto, and it may have potential to be transformed into GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) strains thereafter. Another aspect of the present application provides a nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase, or a vector including the nucleic acid. As used herein, the term ``nucleic acid" has a meaning which collectively includes DNA  or RNA molecules. Nucleotides, which are the basic structural units of the nucleic acids, include not only natural nucleotides but also modified analogs thereof in which sugar or base sites are modified (see Scheit, Nucleotide Analogs, John Wiley, New York (1980); Uhlman and Peyman, Chemical Reviews, 90:543-584 (1990)). The nucleic acid encoding the enzyme of the present application may be a DNA  or RNA  sequence in which nucleotides as a unit are covalently linked, and specifically, it may be any one nucleotide sequence among all possible numbers at the time of DNA conversion of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222 (modification of amino acids into 61 codons), and more Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 specifically it may include a nucleic acid capable of being translated to exhibit a desired enzymatic activity while having at least 90% or more, 95% or more, 97% or more, 99% or more, or 100% homology, similarity, or identity to each nucleotide that can be translated into any one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222 of the present application.  It is apparent that proteins having the same activity due to codon degeneracy, proteins having the same amino acid sequences after being transcribed, specifically, proteins consisting of any one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222, or polynucleotides that can be translated into proteins having a homology, similarity, or identity thereto are also within the scope of the present application. More specifically, the nucleic acid sequence of the present application is not separately shown, and may be composed of all number of DNA codon that can be translated into the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222, but is not limited thereto. Additionally, a probe that may be prepared from a known gene sequence, for example, any sequence which can hybridize with a sequence complementary to all or part of the nucleotide sequence under stringent conditions to encode the enzyme of the present application, may be included without limitation. The -stringent conditions" refer to conditions under which specific hybridization between polynucleotides is allowed. Such conditions are specifically described in the literature (see J.  Sambrook et al., supra 9.50-9.51, 11.7-11.8). For example, the stringent conditions may include conditions under which genes having a high homology or identity of 80%  or higher, 85%  or higher, specifically 90% or higher, more specifically 95% or higher, much more specifically 97%  or higher, still much more specifically 99% or higher are hybridized with each other, and genes having a homology or identity lower than the above homologies or identities are not hybridized with each other, or washing conditions of Southern hybridization, that is, washing once, specifically twice or three times at a salt concentration and a temperature corresponding to 60 C, lx SSC, 0.1% SDS, specifically 60 C, 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, and more specifically 68 C, 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS. Hybridization requires that two nucleic acids contain complementary sequences, although mismatches between bases are possible depending on the stringency of the hybridization. The term -complementary" is used to describe the relationship between nucleotide bases that can hybridize with each other. For example, with respect to DNA, adenine is complementary to thymine, and cytosine is complementary to guanine. Therefore, the present application may include isolated nucleotide fragments complementary to the entire sequence as well as nucleic Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 acid sequences substantially similar thereto. Specifically, the polynucleotides having a homology or identity may be detected using the hybridization conditions including a hybridization step at a T. value of 55 C  under the above-described conditions. Further, the T. value may be 60 C, 63 C, or 65 C, but is not limited thereto, and may be appropriately adjusted by those skilled in the art depending on the purpose thereof. The appropriate stringency for hybridizing polynucleotides depends on the length of the polynucleotides and the degree of complementation, and these variables are well known in the art (see Sambrook et al., supra,9.50-9.51, 11.7-11.8). As used herein, the term ``vector" may refer to a DNA construct containing the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid encoding the enzyme of the present application, which is operably linked to a suitable regulatory sequence such that the target modified protein can be expressed in an appropriate host. The regulatory sequence may include a promoter capable of initiating transcription, any operator sequence for regulating the transcription, a sequence encoding an appropriate mRNA ribosome binding domain, and a sequence regulating the termination of transcription and translation. After being transformed into a suitable host cell, the vector may be replicated or function irrespective of the host genome, and may be integrated into the host genome itself. The vector used in the present application is not particularly limited as long as it is able to replicate in the host cell, and any vector known in the art may be used.  Examples of the vector conventionally used may include natural or recombinant plasmids, cosmids, viruses, and bacteriophages. For example, as a phage vector or cosmid vector, pWE15, M13, MBL3, MBL4, IXII, ASHII, APII, t10, tll, Charon4A, Charon21A, etc. may be used; and as a plasmid vector, those based on pBR, pUC, pBluescriptII, pGEM, pTZ, pCL, pET, etc. and may be used.  Specifically, pDZ, pACYC177, pACYC184, pCL, pECCG117, pUC19, pBR322, pMW118, and pCC1BAC vectors may be used. Still another aspect of the present application provides a transformant including a vector including a nucleic acid encoding the enzyme of the present application. As used herein, the -transformant including the nucleic acid encoding the enzyme" or -transformant including the vector including the nucleic acid encoding the enzyme" may refer to a microorganism that has been recombined so that the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application is expressed. For example, it may refer to a host cell or a microorganism Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 containing a nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase, or which is transformed with a vector containing a nucleic acid encoding psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase so that the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase is expressed. For the purpose of the present application, the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase expressed by the transformant may be composed of any one amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222, but is not limited thereto. As used herein, the term -transformation" refers to the introduction of a vector including a nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase into a host cell so that the protein encoded by the nucleic acid can be expressed in the host cell. As long as the transformed nucleic acid can be expressed in a host cell, it does not matter whether it is integrated into the chromosome of the host cell and located therein or located extrachromosomally, and both cases can be included. Further, the nucleic acid may include DNA and RNA encoding the nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application. The nucleic acid may be introduced in any form, as long as it can be introduced into the host cell and expressed therein.  For example, the nucleic acid may be introduced into the host cell in the form of an expression cassette, which is a gene construct including all elements required for its autonomous expression.  The expression cassette may commonly include a promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid, a transcription terminator, a ribosome binding domain, or a translation terminator. The expression cassette may be in the form of a self-replicable expression vector.  Additionally, the nucleic acid may be introduced into the host cell as it is and operably linked to sequences required for expression in the host cell, but is not limited thereto. In addition, as used herein, the term -operably linked" means that the gene sequence is functionally linked to a promoter sequence that initiates and mediates transcription of the nucleic acid encoding the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application. The insertion of the nucleic acid or the vector into the chromosome may be performed by any method known in the art, for example, by homologous recombination, but the method is not limited thereto. Additionally, the vector may further include a selection marker to confirm the insertion into the chromosome. The selection marker is for selecting the cells transformed with the vector, that is, for confirming whether the target nucleic acid molecule has been inserted, and markers that provide selectable phenotypes, such as drug resistance, auxotrophy, resistance to cell-toxic agents, or expression of surface modified proteins, may be used.  When treated with a selective agent, only the cells expressing the selection marker can survive or express other phenotypic traits, and thus the transformed cells can be selected.    Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 The method of transforming the vector of the present application includes any method of introducing a nucleic acid into a cell, and may be performed by selecting a suitable standard technique known in the art, depending on the host cell. For example, the method may include electroporation, calcium phosphate (CaPO4) precipitation, calcium chloride (CaCl2) precipitation, retroviral infection, microinjection, a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) method, a DEAE¨dextran method, a cationic liposome method, and a lithium acetate¨DMSO method, but is not limited thereto. As the host cell, it is preferable to use a host having a high efficiency of introducing DNA  and a high efficiency of expressing the introduced DNA. For example, it may be a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium, a microorganism of the genus Escherichia, a microorganism of the genus Serratia, a microorganism of the genus Bacillus, a microorganism of the genus Saccharomyces, or a microorganism of the genus Pichia, and specifically, it may be E. coil, but is not limited thereto, and may be applied to all GRAS strains. More specifically, the transformant of the present application may be 222 in total, from E. coil BL21(DE3)/pET-CJ-apl to E. coil BL21(DE3)/pET-CJ-ap222. Yet another aspect of the present application provides a composition for producing psicose including the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase, a microorganism expressing the same, or a culture of the microorganism. Specifically, the composition may further include a sugar phosphate, and more specifically, it may further include psicose-6-phosphate as a substrate, but is not limited thereto. The composition for producing psicose of the present application may produce psicose through the dephosphorylation of psicose-6-phosphate by including the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase which acts to produce psicose by dephosphorylating psicose-6-phosphate, a microorganism expressing the same, or a culture of the microorganism. Additionally, the composition for producing psicose of the present application may further include an enzyme and/or a substrate involved in the psicose production pathway of the present application [(i) starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or a combination thereof; (ii) a phosphate or polyphosphate or other phosphorylating compounds; (iii) a fructose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase; (iv) a glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase; (v) a phosphoglucomutase or a glucokinase;  and/or (vi) an a-glucan phosphorylase, a starch phosphorylase, a maltodextrin phosphorylase, a sucrose phosphorylase, an a-amylase, a pullulanase, an isoamylase, a glucoamylase, an a-glucanotransferase, a polyphosphate glucokinase, or a sucrase]; a microorganism expressing the Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 enzymes involved in the psicose production pathway; or a culture of the microorganism expressing the enzymes involved in the psicose production pathway. However, the enzymes that are included in the composition for producing psicose of the present application and the substrates used in the production of psicose are merely illustrative and are not limited as long as psicose can be produced using the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application. Specifically, the fructose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase may include any protein that is active in converting fructose-6-phosphate to psicose-6-phosphate. The glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase may include any protein that is active in converting glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate.  The phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2) may include any protein that is active in converting g luco se-l-pho sphate to glucose-6-phosphate.                            The starch/maltodextrin phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1) and a-glucan phosphorylase may include any protein that is active in phosphoryl transfer to glucose to produce glucose-1-phosphate from starch or maltodextrin. The sucrose phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.7) may include any protein that is active in phosphoryl transfer to glucose to produce glucose- 1-phosphate from sucrose. The a-amylase (EC  3.2.1.1), pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41), isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68), 4-a-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25), and glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3), which are starch-liquefying enzymes, may include any protein that is active in converting starch or maltodextrin to debranched maltooligosaccharide or glucose.

The method of the present application may further include converting glucose into glucose-6-phosphate by bringing glucose into contact with polyphosphate glucokinase, a microorganism expressing the polyphosphate glucokinase, or a culture of the microorganism expressing the polyphosphate glucokinase, and polyphosphate, prior to the step of converting glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate. The method of the present application may further include converting starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or a combination thereof into glucose-1-phosphate by bringing starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or a combination thereof into contact with a-glucan phosphorylase, starch phosphorylase, maltodextrin phosphorylase, or sucrose phosphorylase; a microorganism expressing the phosphorylase; or a culture of the microorganism expressing the phosphorylase, and phosphate, prior to the step of converting glucose-1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate. The method of the present application may further include converting starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or a combination thereof into glucose by bringing starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or a combination thereof into contact with a-amylase, pullulanase, isoamylase, glucoamylase, or sucrase; a microorganism expressing the a-amylase, pullulanase, glucoamylase, sucrase, or isoamylase; or a culture of the microorganism expressing the a-amylase, pullulanase, glucoamylase, sucrase, or isoamylase, prior to converting starch, maltodextrin, sucrose, or a combination thereof into glucose-1-phosphate. The psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase, a-glucan phosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase (or phosphomannomutase), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, psicose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase (or ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase), pullulanase (or isoamylase), 4-a-glucanotransferase, and polyphosphate glucokinase that are used in the method for producing psicose of the present application may have little or no side reactions with psicose, which is the final product. In the method for producing psicose of the present application, the optimal/maximum psicose may be produced in a complex combination with sugar phosphate¨converting enzymes by decomposing a high concentration of starch, and a maximum of 8 kinds of enzymes may be used in combination to secure the maximum productivity of psicose. First, glucan phosphorylase (glycogen phosphorylase, EC 2.4.1.1), an enzyme that degrades starch and produces glucose-1-phosphate, specifically produces glucose- 1-phosphate on a-1,4-bound starch. Secondly, phosphoglucomutase (EC 2.7.5.1) or phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8), which converts the thus-produced glucose- 1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate, is used in the intermediate complex enzyme reaction. As the third enzyme used, Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), which converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate,    is       used.    Fourth, ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase    or psicose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase, which is the enzyme that converts fructose-6-phosphate to psicose-6-phosphate as described above, is used to produce psicose-6-phosphate in a reversible reaction. In the reaction of starch to psicose-6-phosphate, although it is impossible to produce more than a certain amount in the reversible reaction, the use of the selective psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase included in the present invention enables the production of psicose in high yield. In order to further increase the starch utilization rate, pullulanase (EC  3.2.1.41) or isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68) is used together to degrade branched a-1,6 bonds in addition to the a-1,4 bonds of amylopectin. Additionally, in order to increase the starch utilization of glucan phosphorylase, 4-a-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) is used. The utilization of the segmented starch substrate can be increased by binding oligosaccharides in the form of a-1,4 bonds to maltose or other oligosaccharides, which are substrates with relatively low activity. In addition, polyphosphate¨glucose phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.63) can be used to produce additional psicose through complex enzymatic reactions from glucose degraded after the use of starch, thereby securing the maximum psicose conversion rate. Further, in the method of the present application, the contact may be carried out at a pH of  
 5.0 to 9.0, specifically at a pH of 6.0 to 8Ø In the method of the present application, the contact may be carried out at a temperature of 40 C to 80 C, specifically at a temperature of 40 C to 60 C or 50 C to 60 C. In the method of the present application, the contact may be carried out for 2 hours to 24 hours, specifically for 6 to 24 hours or 120 hours. In the method of the present application, the contact may be carried out at a pH of 5.0 to 9.0, at a temperature of 40 C to 80 C, and/or for 2 hours to 24 hours.  Specifically, the contact may be carried out at a pH of 6.0 to 8.0, at a temperature of 40 C to 60 C or 50 C to 60 C, and/or for 6 hours to 24 hours or 120 hours. The method of the present application may further include purifying psicose.  There is no particular limitation on the method for purifying psicose, and any suitable method known in the art may be used.                                                      Non-limiting examples of such purification methods include chromatography, fractional crystallization, and ion purification, which may be carried out alone or in a combination of two or more thereof. For example, the reaction product of psicose may be purified by chromatography. In this case, the purification of saccharides by chromatography Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 may be performed based on small differences in binding force between saccharides to be purified and metal ions attached to an ionic resin. The method of the present application may further include bleaching, demineralizing, or both before or after the purification step. The bleaching and/or demineralizing enables production of purer psicose without impurities.

Example 2: Preparation of Recombinant Enzymes In order to prepare recombinant enzymes, a culture tube containing 5 mL of an LB liquid medium was inoculated with each of the transformed microorganisms prepared in Example 1.  The seed culture was performed in a shaking incubator at 37 C until an absorbance of 2.0 at 600 nm was reached. The culture broth obtained by way of the seed culture was inoculated to a culture flask containing the LB liquid medium, followed by main culture. When the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 2.0, 1 mM IPTG was added to induce the expression and production of a recombinant enzyme. The culture was performed at a stirring speed of 180 rpm, and the culture temperature was maintained at 37 C. The culture broth was centrifuged at 8,000xg and at 4 C for 20 minutes to recover cells. The recovered cells were washed with 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0) buffer twice and re-suspended in the same buffer, and the cells were disrupted using an ultrasonic homogenizer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000xg and 4 C for 20 minutes to obtain only supernatant. The recombinant enzyme was purified from the supernatant by His-tag affinity chromatography, and the purified recombinant enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 8.0) and was then used for subsequent reaction. Example 3: Analysis of Dephosphorylation Activity of Su2ar Phosphate and Psicose-6-phosphate After preparing psicose-6-phosphate from fructose-6-phosphate, the activity of psicose production by psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase was confirmed, or the activity was measured by detecting psicose by further adding three enzymes using glucose- 1-phosphate as the first substrate.  In particular, glucose, fructose, and psicose, which are common sugars produced by mixing each of the 222 phosphatases of the present application with the three enzymes (i.e., phosphoglucomutase (EC 2.7.5.1) or phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8), which converts glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate; glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC  5.3.1.9), which converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate; and ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase or psicose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase, which is an enzyme that converts fructose-6-phosphate to psicose-6-phosphate) were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated.    Date Recue/Date Received 2021-06-09 Specifically, 50 mM fructose-6-phosphate or 20 mM glucose-1-phosphate was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.0), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6 to 7), or 50 mM  potassium phosphate (pH 6 to 7), and then 0.1 unit/mL of phosphoglucomutase;  phosphomannomutase, glucose-6-phosphate    isomerase,    and    ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase;     or psicose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase and each of the 222 recombinant psicose-6-phosphate phosphatases prepared in Example 2 were added thereto, and the mixture was allowed to react at 45 C to 70 C for 1 to 24 hours. The production of glucose, fructose, and psicose was confirmed by HPLC, which was performed using an SP 0810 column (Shodex) and an Aminex column (Bio-RAD) at 80 C with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, and detected using a refractive index detector (RID). Thereafter, in the prepared mixed solution of glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and psicose-6-phosphate, the dephosphorylation activity of the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase of the present application and the psicose-6-phosphate-specific (selective) dephosphorylation rate were measured. Specifically, 0.1 unit/mL of each of the psicose-6-phosphate phosphatase and 5 mM  MgC12(or MgSO4) were added to the mixed solution of 1% (w/v) glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and psicose-6-phosphate, and the mixture was allowed to react at 50 C for 12 hours. The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87C column (Bio-RAD), at 80 C with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. A  refractive index detector was used to detect the production of psicose and other saccharides (fructose and glucose). As a result, among all 222 enzymes, 69 enzymes showed high selective dephosphorylation activity for psicose-6-phosphate, and 45 enzymes showed weak selective dephosphorylation activity for psicose-6-phosphate.                        Additionally, in 108 enzymes, the dephosphorylation titer for selective psicose-6-phosphate could not be confirmed. However, dephosphorylation activity was confirmed in 221 enzymes excluding one of the 222 enzymes, of which 113 enzymes showed high dephosphorylation activity, and 108 enzymes showed low dephosphorylation activity. Meanwhile, the enzyme of SEQ ID NO: 54, which was confirmed to have no dephosphorylation titer, is known as a dephosphorylation enzyme, but it was confirmed that it has no substantial dephosphorylation activity. The results are summarized in Table 3 below.

As the seven enzymes, glucan phosphorylase, which degrades starch and converts it into glucose- 1-phosphate, pullulanase, which debranches starch, 4-a-glucanotransferase, which increases the utilization of starch substrate, phosphoglucomutase, which converts glucose- 1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate, psicose-6-phosphate-3-epimerase, which converts fructose-6-phosphate into psicose-6-phosphate, and enzymes of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 222 capable of producing psicose from psicose-6-phosphate were prepared and used in an amount of 0.1 unit/mL. 5% (w/v) maltodextrin was added to 1 mM to 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM  to 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and the mixture was allowed to react at a temperature of 50 C for 12 hours. The reaction products were analyzed by HPLC using an Aminex column (Bio-RAD) at 80 C at a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and detected using a refractive index detector. As a result, it was confirmed that psicose was produced from maltodextrin through the multiple enzymatic reactions.
