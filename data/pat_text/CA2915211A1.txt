More particularly, the present invention relates to a vaccine comprising a novel P. salmonis isolate that is used in a fish vaccine to protect salmonid fish against piscirickettsiosis, also referred to as salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS). Background of the invention Chile is the second largest producer of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the world. In 2007 Chile faced a major crisis after several outbreaks of Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) causing a setback in the salmon industry. The national salmon industry has since been building up and Chile produced an estimated amount of 515,000 tons in 2012, making the latter year the most productive year in the history of Chilean aquaculture (Perez C: Consumo de antibioticos totaliz6 338 toneladas el 2012. In: Salmon Xpert. http://www.salmonxpert.c1/?page_id=147&article id=98232; 2013). Although having successful years of salmonid production, the industry has constantly been facing problems with Piscirickettsia salmonis, the causative agent of salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS). Currently, P. salmonis is considered the most important species causing high mortalities at many farming sites in Chile. P. salmonis was responsible for 82 % of the total use of antibacterial products in Chile in 2012 (Perez et al, supra), pinpointing the importance of detailed knowledge about the bacteria in order to develop alternative and efficient treatment methods. The family Piscirickettsiaceae {Fryer et al (2005), Family IT.  Piscirickettsiaceae lam. nov. In: Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Volume 2: The Proteobacteria Part B: The Gammaproteobacteria. Edited by Garrity G, Brenner DJ, Krieg NR, Staley JR, vol. 2, 2nd edn. Web: Springer; 2005: 180-184, Validation List no. 106, Euzeby J:  Validation of publication of new names and new combinations previously effectively published outside the IJSEM. International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 2005, 55(6):2235-2238) contains Gram-negative, aerobic, coccoid, rod or spiral shaped and occasionally pleiomorphic bacteria. Species within the family are isolated predominantly from the marine environment (Fryer et al., supra), but isolation from fresh water environment has also been reported (Gaggero et al: First Isolation of Piscirickettsia- Salmonis from Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus-Kisutch (Walbaum), and Rainbow-Trout, Oncorhynchus-Mykiss (Walbaum), during the Fresh-Water Stage of Their Life-Cycle. Journal of fish diseases 1995, 18(3):277-279). All members of the family belong to the class Gainmaproteobacteria with 16S rRNA similarities as the main unifying factor (Fryer et al, (2005) supra). Piscirickettsiaceae contains six genera; Piscirickettsia, Cycloclasticus, Hydrogenovibrio, Methylophaga, Thioalkalimicrobium, and Thiomicrospira (Fryer et al, (2005) supra).  
 2 Although having a phylogenetic relationship, these genera vary in phenotypic characters and share only a few common characteristics (Fryer et al. (2005), supra). The genus Piscirickettsia contains one species, Piscirickettsia salmonis (Fryer et al.(1992), Piscirickettsia-Salmonis Gen-Nov, Sp-Nov, the Causative Agent of an Epizootic Disease in Salmonid Fishes. Int J Syst Bacteriol, 42(1):120-126), and as of yet no other species has been described. P. salmonis is a Gram-negative, predominantly coccoid, non-motile, non-encapsulated, aerobic, and highly fastidious facultative intracellular bacteria that is approx. 0.5-1.5 um in diameter (Fryer and Larman CN: Family II. Piscirickettsiaceae fam. nov. In:  Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Volume 2: The Proteobacteria Part B: The Gammaproteobacteria. Edited by Garrity G, Brenner DJ, Krieg NR, Staley JR, vol. 2, 2nd edn. Web: Springer; 2005: 180-184, Gomez et al.: Additional evidence of the facultative intracellular nature of the fish bacterial pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis.  Arch Med Vet 2009, 41(3):261-267, Cvitanich et al.: The Isolation of a Rickettsia-Like Organism Causing Disease and Mortality in Chilean Salmonids and Its Confirmation by Koch Postulate. Journal of fish diseases 1991, 14(2):121-145). Although initially being described as non-motile it has been revealed that P.  salmonis possess a set of flagellar genes that under certain conditions may be synthesized (Wilhelm et al.: A vaccine against the salmonid pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis based on recombinant proteins. Vaccine 2006, 24(23):5083-5091). The bacteria replicates in vitro within cytoplasmic inclusions in host cells (Fryer et al. (1990), Isolation of a Rickettsiales-Like Organism from Diseased Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus-Kisutch) in Chile. Fish Pathol, 25(2):107-114), and has recently proved to induce cell death by apoptosis in trout macrophages (Rojas et al.: Piscirickettsia salmonis induces apoptosis in macrophages and monocyte-like cells from rainbow trout. Journal of cellular biochemistry 2010, 110(2):468-476). Optimal temperatures for replication in vitro are 15-18  C, and no replication occurs above 25  C or below 10  C (Fryer et al.  (1990), supra, Fryer and Mauel: The Rickettsia: An emerging group of pathogens in fish. Emerg Infect Dis 1997, 3(2):137-144). P. sahnonis has typically been cultured on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchtis tshawytscha) cell lines, CHSE-214 (Lannan CN, Winton JR, Fryer JL: Fish Cell-Lines - Establishment and Characterization of 9 Cell-Lines from Salmonids. In Vitro Cell Dev B 1984, 20(9):671-676), and was first described as an obligatory intracellular bacteria (Fryer et al., 1992, supra). However, P.  salmonis has later been found to grow on artificial cell-free medium (Mikalsen et al.: Agar culture of Piscirickettsia salmonis, a serious pathogen of farmed salmonid and marine fish. FEMS microbiology letters 2008, 278(1):43-47, Mauel et al.: Culture of Piscirickettsia salmonis on enriched blood agar. Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation: official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc 2008, 20(2):213-214, Yanez et al.: Two novel blood-free solid media for the culture of the salmonid pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis. Journal of Fish Diseases 2013, 36(6):587-591, W02008/002152).  
 3 P. salmonis was first observed in 1989 and caused a novel disease of Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) reared in marine net pens near Puerto Montt, Chile (Bravo and Campos: Coho salmon syndrome in Chile. Fish Health Section Newsletter, American Fisheries Society 1989, 17:3). The pathogen was initially termed unknown agent (UA) and the disease caused by the agent have been referred to as Coho salmon syndrome (Branson and Diazmunoz : Description of a New Disease Condition Occurring in Farmed Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus-Kisutch (Walbaum), in South-America. Journal of fish diseases 1991, 14(2):147-156), salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (Cvitanich et al.:  The Isolation of a Rickettsia-Like Organism Causing Disease and Mortality in Chilean Salmonids and Its Confirmation by Koch Postulate. Journal of fish diseases 1991, 14(2):121-145) and piscirickettsiosis (Fryer et al, 1992, supra, and Lannan and Fryer:  Piscirickettsia-Salmonis, a Major Pathogen of Salmonid Fish in Chile. Fish Res 1993, 17(1-2):115-121). P. salmonis has been confilmed in various countries including Chile, Norway, Canada, USA, Ireland, Scotland and Greece. Although promising vaccine research have been described in previous literature (Wilhelm et al.: A vaccine against the salmon pathogen Piscirickettsia salrnonis based on recombinant proteins, Vaccine, 2006, 24 (23): 5083-5091, Kuzyk et al., An efficacious recombinant subunit vaccine against the salmonid rickettsia' pathogen Piscirickettsia salmon/s. Vaccine 2001, 19 (17-19):2337-2344), there are as of yet no commercially available vaccines that are able to handle the ongoing SRS  problems Chilean fish farmers are facing today. For unknown reasons, the vaccines available have variable effect. The complexities of SRS in regards to bacterial isolates are not fully studied and this may accomplice to the varying vaccine effect observed. As a consequence of lack in alternative treatment methods, many farmers choose to treat their fish with antibacterial products, however with variable effect as the bacterium responds poorly to the available antibiotics. According to a report published by the National Fisheries and Aquaculture, Sernapesca, the salmon industry in Chile used 337.99 tons of antibiotics in 2012, 206.8 in 2011, 143.2 in 2010, 184.5 in 2009, 325.6 in 2008 and 385.6 in 2007 Perez, 2013, supra). As the production increased in 2012, the highest use of antibacterial products were recorded, most of which solely dedicated to the treatment of SRS (Perez, 2013, supra). To find efficient treatment methods and to enhance vaccine development against SRS, knowledge about individual strains on a phenotypic and genotypic level is important. Genome sequences make it possible to design multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes by enabling identification of candidate MLST loci for the development of oligonucleotide primers for their amplification and sequencing by PCR (cf.  Maiden (2006), Multilocus sequence typing of bacteria. Annu Rev Microbiol 2006, 60:561-588.  MLST was proposed as an accurate tool for strain-typing and measurement of genetic variability Maiden et al. (1998). A set of individual housekeeping genes or candidate MLST loci that encode proteins under stabilizing selection for conserving a metabolic important function are commonly selected for MLST schemes. Such conservative genes  
 4 are perfect for the performance of diversity mapping and strain differentiation, as these genes should not be subject to diversifying selection. In this regard, MLST  schemes function as a tool for the potential discovery of a new species. MLST schemes have been applied to a wide range of species and have proven to be a robust standard of typing Larsen et al. (2012). The main objective of the present invention is to provide an isolate of the causative agent of salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) that may be used as an agent in a vaccine useful in the preparation of P. salmonis infections in farmed fish. It is furthermore an object of the present invention to provide a vaccine to protect against P. salmonis infections and SRS in farmed fish. Summary of the invention The present invention provides an isolated Piscirickettsia spp. strain that when administered to fish result in efficient immunization against further P.  salmonis infections. The Piscirickettsia spp. stain according to the present invention can be used in vaccines against SRS, alone or in combination with other antigens from other fish pathogenic organisms, such as e.g. live, attenuated, killed or inactivated bacteria or virus in polyvalent vaccines. The Piscirickettsia spp. strain of the present invention differs from P.  salmonis strains previously described in the prior art. The present inventors have inter alia performed a phenotypic and genetic characterization of a large number of Piscirickettsia spp. isolates from Chile and Canada and compare them to the type-strain of P. salmonis, LF-89. This was done to obtain information about possible presence of heterogeneous elades that may explain the variable vaccine effect and the variable clinical expressions observed in the field. According to one embodiment, the present invention provides a P. salmonis isolate, wherein said isolate is selected from the group consisting of: a) a P. salmonis isolate ID8079 deposited under the Budapest Treaty with the Leibniz Insitute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) on 6th of June 2013 under deposit number DSM 27338; and b) a P.sahnonis isolate having substantially the same genotypic and phenotypic characteristics as the P. salmonis isolate of a). The new P. salmonis according to the present invention differs from other P.  salmonis isolates previously disclosed in the prior art as seen from the experimental data presented herein. In particular, the P. salmonis isolate according to the present invention, considering the genotyping and the phenotypic traits of the new isolate 1D8079 is a candidate of a new sub species of P. salmon/s. It is noted that the new  
 5 isolate provides improved characteristics compared with earlier known P.  salmonis isolates of importance e.g. when being utilized in vaccine production. For example, the new isolate of the present invention provides:      Faster and better growth characteristic as seen on optimized agar compared to the LF-89 type strain. m                     Growth on several more different growth mediums compared to the type strain. iu                    Growth at a wider and lower temperature range is seen compared to the type strain. In particular, the P. salmonis isolate of the present invention grow in the area of 8 ¨ 25 'C. ^    A hemolytic activity is seen on blood agar, which is not seen on the type strain. ^    The new isolate produce alpha and beta-glucosidase. According to one embodiment, the present invention provides a P. salmonis strain deposited with DSMZ under deposit number DSM 27338. The present invention furthermore provides for vaccines comprising a P.  salmonis isolate according to the present invention. The present invention furthermore provides for methods for manufacturing vaccines according to the present invention. The present inventors have furthermore found a new culturing media, more particular an agar, that is particularly suitable for culturing of the P. salmonis isolate of the present invention. The present invention thus provides a growth medium, comprising animal blood, such as ovine blood, and fetal serum derived from animal blood, such as fetal bovine serum. In particular the present invention provides a growth medium comprising tryptic soy agar, ovine blood, cysteine, glucose, serum derived from animal blood, and ferric nitrate. According to one embodiment of the present invention provides a growth medium comprising a growth medium comprising tryptic soy agar, defibrinated ovine blood, red sea salt, cysteine, glucose, serum derived from animal blood, and ferric nitrate Drawings Figure 1 Illustrate the scale with three growth zones used to estimate bacterial growth.

Detailed description of the invention The present invention provides a new P. salmonis isolate that can be used in vaccines to obtain protection against further P. salmonis infection and thus the prevention of the development of SRS in farmed fish. The P. salmonis of the present invention was obtained after comprehensive isolation, culturing and analysis of a large number of isolates obtained in field from Atlantic salmon or rainbow trout diagnosed with or suspected of having SRS. The closer analysis of the phenotypic characteristics of the obtained isolates surprisingly revealed that one of the isolates showed growth characteristics that are particularly advantageous for a vaccine candidate. Furthermore, the genotypic analysis showed that the novel strain ID8079 could be grouped together with the isolates ID8765, ID8558, ID8465, and ID8466, differing inter alia from the type strain LF-89, which could be grouped together with the isolates 1D8741, ID8670, ID817, and ID1850. The novel P. salmonis isolate named ID8079 herein is deposited under the Budapest Treaty with the Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) on 6th of June 2013 under deposit number DSM 27338. Upon infection of a fish with an amount of the isolate according to the present invention sufficient to develop SRS, the fish will develop symptoms of said disease.  Common symptoms in the acute stages are hemorrhages in the brain, eyes and skin, splenomegaly and congestion in internal organs. Common symptoms in the chronic stages are e.g.  whitish nodules in the liver which progress to granulomes and the liver becomes yellowish, and the hemorrhages in the skin progress to pustuls and finally to caverns in the muscle, and in respect of splenomegaly, pericarditis and fibrin deposit is seen in the abdomen. The P. salmonis isolate according to the present invention has shown improved growth characteristics compared with the type strain LF-89, and also compared with other isolates disclosed herein. The P. salmonis isolate was e.g. shown to be a significantly faster growing isolate, within the broadest temperature range, compared with the type strain LF-89 and also compared with other isolates disclosed herein. The P.  sahnonis isolate according to the present invention was furthermore shown to be less fastidious as  
 7 to growth on different growth media compared with the type strain and also compared with the other isolates disclosed herein. In particular, the present P.  salmon's isolate according to the present invention was found to grow particularly fast on the growth medium according to the present invention. A further distinctive feature of the P. salmon's isolate according to the present invention surprisingly tested positive a-glucosidase and 13 -glucosidase, which are contrary to the type strain LF-89 and the further P. salmonis isolates disclosed herein. The P. salmonis isolate according to the present invention is furthermore a Gram negative coccoid bacterium, with a size within the area of 0.4¨ 1.8 pm, and with similar cell morphology as other P. salmon's isolates. A P. salmon's isolate according to the present invention is to be understood to mean a P. salmon's strain with the above characteristics, i.e. with substantially the same phenotypic and genotypic characteristics as the isolate ID8079. Although the present inventors have isolated and characterized a particular strain disclosed herein with inter alia the advantageous growth characteristics and which may be used in the preparation of a fish vaccine, i.e. ID8079, the skilled person will acknowledge that other strains being closely related to 1D8079, i.e. having substantially the same genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, is meant to be covered by the present invention. Thus, it is to be understood that the present invention covers P. salmon's strains exerting more or less equivalent genotypic and phenotypic characteristics as the isolate ID8079 (DSM 27338), i.e. having substantially the same growth characteristics and also substantially the same ability to induce protection against P. salmonis infection in farmed fish when used in the preparation of a fish vaccine. The skilled person will acknowledge that various substitutions, deletions or additions to the genomic sequence may be introduced by commonly available gene technology methods or randomly during culturing of a bacterium strain, and that such alteration may be introduced on purpose or randomly/accidentally without substantially changing the characteristics of said strain. It is to be understood that P. salmon's strains differing from the strains of the present invention merely by the purposely or randomly introduction of such alteration in the genome that do not substantially effect the phenotypic characteristics are covered by the present invention. The expression "having substantially the same genotypic characteristics" is thus to be understood to mean P. salmon is strains where the relevant parts of the genome of the strains to be compared has a high degree of sequence identity compared with the strain ID8079 (DSM  27338).  
 8 It is furthermore to be understood that also further mutants originating from the P.  salmon's isolate of the present invention, i.e. such as a functionally equivalent mutant having substantially the same genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, is covered by the present invention. The term "mutant thereof' as used herein is thus to be understood to mean a strain derived from a P. salmon's isolate of the present invention, in particular derived from the strain 1D8079 (DSM 27338), by means of e.g. genetic engineering, mutagenizing conditions or by culturing. It is also to be understood that inactivated or attenuated P. salmon's strains originating from a P. salmon's strain according to the present invention is covered by the present invention. The P. salrnonis isolate of the present invention may be used to prepare a vaccine useful in preventing P. salmon's and the development of SRS in farmed fish. The expression "vaccine" as used herein it to be understood to refer to any type of biological agent in an administrable form capable of stimulating a protective immune response in a recipient fish after being administered said vaccine. The biological agent included in a vaccine is commonly an antigen, such as a pathogen organism (live, attenuated or inactivated), or parts thereof (e.g. a suitable protein comprising a useful epitope), allowing the immune system to develop a response which is accelerated in case of later infections by said pathogen. When used as the antigen in a vaccine, the P. salmon's isolate according to the present invention may be used as an attenuated or inactivated form of said isolate. An attenuated form of the P. salmon's isolate according to the present invention maintains the ability to induce protection against SRS although it is no longer as virulent as the P. salmon's ID8079. An attenuated form of the P. salmon's isolate according to the present invention may be obtained by any method well known to the skilled person. For example, attenuated form may be obtained by serial passages or by mutagenesis techniques well known to the skilled person. The P. salrnonis isolate according to the present invention may also be included in polyvalent vaccines. As used herein, a polyvalent vaccine is a vaccine comprising two or more different biological agent in an administrable form capable of stimulating a protective immune response in a recipient fish after being administered said vaccine. In particular, a polyvalent vaccine stimulates the immune system of the recipient against two or more different pathogens. A non-limiting list of pathogens that may be included in a polyvalent vaccine (in live, attenuated or inactivated form) is live, attenuated or inactivated fish virus selected from the group consisting of Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (114NY), Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV), Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV), Salmon Pancreatic virus (SAV), Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VIISC), Cardiomyopathy Syndrom Virus (CMSV) and/or live, attenuated or  
 9 inactivated bacteria selected from the group consisting of Aerothonas sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Brevibacterium sp., Cytophaga sp., Edwarsiella sp., Flavobacterium sp., Francisella sp., Lactococcus sp., Leuconosloc sp., Listonella sp.  Moritella vi,scosa, Mycobacterium sp. Nocardia sp., Pediococcus sp., Photobacterium damsel, Pseudumonas sp., Renibacterium sp., Rhodococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Vibrio sp., and Yersinia sp.. The P. salmonis isolate of the present invention may also be included in polyvalent vaccines wherein the one or more further biological agent consists of one or more recombinant protein, e.g. comprising suitable epitopes useful in immunization of a recipient fish against a fish pathogen, e.g. a fish pathogens selected from the group listed above. The P. salmonis isolate of the present invention may also be included in polyvalent vaccines wherein the one or more further biological agents are provided as a DNA vaccine plasmid constructed in order to enable the expression of a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen or epitope useful in immunization of a recipient fish against a fish pathogen, e.g. a fish pathogens selected from the group listed above. Examples of DNA  vaccines developed for vaccination of fish is described in Heras et al., Fish Shellfish Immunol., 2009, 27, pp. 120-129, EP 1 818406 Al, and W02008/031572. Polyvalent vaccines according to the present invention may thus be prepared from whole cells, killed and/or attenuated virus or bacteria, protein extracts isolated from the above mentioned pathogens, isolated or recombinant antigens, DNA vaccine plasmids, and/or mixtures thereof. The vaccine according to the present invention may be administered to fish by any of methods for administering vaccines well known to the skilled person. For example, the vaccine according to the present invention may be administered by intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection. Vaccination may also be accomplished through oral ingestion or by means of aqueous immersion. The vaccine according to the present invention comprises an effective immunization dose of P. salmonis. The term "effective immunization dosage" is to be understood to mean the amount which will induce immunity in a farmed fish when challenged by a virulent strain of P. salmonis. Immunity is considered obtained when the level of protection of vaccinated fish is significantly higher than in a comparable population of unvaccinated fish. Based on the general knowledge of vaccine formulation, the skilled person will be able to identify the appropriate dose to be included in the vaccine, e.g.  
 10 based on the form of the pathogen (inactivated, attenuated, etc.), the size of the recipient fish, etc. Vaccination of fish by injection can be performed either with or without adjuvant. Adjuvants are introduced in order to enhance the efficacy of the vaccine.  Mineral oil adjuvants are commonly used in fish vaccines and may be included in the vaccine according to the present invention. A non-limited example of an oil adjuvant that may be included in the vaccine of the present invention is mannide oleate in a mineral oil solution. Suitable mineral oils to be included are e.g. white mineral oil, i.e. sorbitan oleate, or polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Also synthetic mineral oils, such as those commercially available under the name Montanide ISA563, Montanide USA  575, Montanide ISA 711, and Montanide 760 may be used. Other useful adjuvant that may be used in a fish vaccine according to the present invention is e.g. squalene, muramuldipeptides, lipopolysaccharides, and glycans or glucans, or inorganic adjuvants such as an aluminium hydroxide and calcium phosphates. Yet a further useful adjuvant is Carbopol polymers (polymers of acrylic acid cross linked with polyalkenyl ethers or divinyl glycol), such as CarbopolC. The vaccine according to the present invention is generally administered along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The particular pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent used is not critical in respect of the present invention. Any well known carrier or diluent commonly used in vaccines to be administered to fish may be used. The vaccine according to the present invention may e.g. be formulated as a water-in-oil-emulsion, an oil-in-water-emulsion or a water-in-oil-in water emulsion. Injection of the vaccine according to the present invention may be performed on a commercial scale using a fixed dose automatic repeating syringe or an automatic injection vaccination machine designed to deliver a fixed dose of e.g. 0.1 or 0.2 ml per fish. The vaccine may be injected through the body wall into the intra-peritoneal cavity or by injecting the vaccine into the dorsal sinus. The vaccination is preferably performed following anesthetization. SRS was first observed in salmonids. Salmonids are elongated, ray-finned bony fish, having a small adipose fin without fin rays between the dorsal fin and the tail. Many salmonids live in the sea, but enter fresh water to spawn. Although SRS is most commonly a problem in the farming of salmonids, and thus may be found in e.g.  rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, coho salmon, Chinook salmon, pink salmon, masou salmon, SRS-like syndromes are also found in non-salmonids, such as seabass (e.g.  white seabass (Atractoscion nobilis)). The present invention furthermore provides a novel growth medium for the cultivation of P. salmonis and bacteria belonging to the Piscirickettsia genus. In particular, the  
 11 present growth medium is useful in cultivation of the P. salmon is isolate according to the present invention. The present inventors have found that a growth medium suitable for culturing the P. salmon is isolate of the present invention comprising animal blood and serum derived from animal blood, in particular ovine blood and fetal bovine serum. The growth medium is further based on a mixture comprising tryptic soy agar, ovine blood, glucose, cysteine, fetal serum derived from animal blood, such as fetal bovine serum, and ferric nitrate. According to one embodiment of the invention, defibrinated ovine blood is used. According to a further embodiment, the present growth medium comprises tryptic soy agar and ovine blood, sea salt such as red sea salt, glucose, cysteine, fetal bovine serum and ferric nitrate. An amount of sea salt in the area of 15 ¨ 25 g/L was furthermore found applicable. Furthermore, it was found that a preferable amount of L-cysteine in the growth medium according to the present invention is at least 1 g/L. The growth medium according to the present invention may be prepared by first dissolving tryptic soy agar and sea salt, such as e.g. red sea salt, in water (preferably reverse osmosis water), and after heating (in autoclave), defibrinated blood is added and the mixture is kept in a water bath at 80 C until a brown mixture is obtained.  After cooling, the remaining ingredients may be added. The pH of the growth medium is preferably adjusted if need be (to about 6.8   0.2). The growth medium may then be transferred to any suitable agar plate. Upon plating of the isolates according to the present invention on agar plates comprising the growth medium according to the present invention, a translucent layer of bacteria could be seen the following day.  The P. salinonis isolate 1D8079 showed a significant faster growth on the growth medium of the present invention compared with the type strain FL-89. The present invention may be better understood by reference to the following non-limiting examples, which are provided as exemplary of the invention. The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention. They should in no way be construed as limiting to the broad scope of the invention. Examples Example 1 Phenotypic characterization Bacterial isolates Bacterial isolates included in the study were initially isolated in the field from Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout diagnosed with SRS at various farming sites in Chile (Table 2). The Canadian isolate CA-9 was isolated from Atlantic salmon after suspicion of SRS. A sample of kidney tissue from the hosts Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout was streaked out on an agar plate and sent to the Fish Disease group at the University of  
 12 Bergen where sub-cultures of the isolates were made and stored for later characterization. All of the respective isolates included in the present study were isolated in lab and preserved at -80  C in a 1.8 ml Nunc tube. An overview of all of the isolates included in the study is presented in Table 1. Isolation, propagation and preservation All the isolates were initially cultured on a CHAB agar (Mikalsen J et al (2008), Agar culture of Piscirickettsia salmonis, a serious pathogen of farmed salmonid and marine fish. Ferns Microbiology Letters, 278(1):43-47.), and later sub-cultured on an optimized novel SRS blood agar developed for the present study (see table 2 below) to do the comparative characterization. Culture of P. salmonis was carried out by defrosting Nunc cryo tubes containing the respective isolates from -80  C to 4 C (30 min to 1 h). A subsample of 100 in of the bacterial solution was added and streaked to an agar plate (passage one after freeze, PlF) using an L-shaped spreader (VWR, U.S.A.), and incubated at 19  C for growth. When successfully growing a pure culture of the bacteria, DNA was extracted followed by PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The gene was sequenced to confirm that the bacteria belonged to Piscirickettsia sp. After confirmation, a new passage (P2F) was made. P2F was stored at -80  C following the freezing protocol for P. salmonis isolates from agar plates; P. salmonis cultures with no more than 5 - 7 days of incubation were used for freezing. A volume of 3 ml of sterilized PBS 1.5% NaC1 was applied to the plate.  The plates were gently moved detaching the bacterial culture from the agar.  Totally 900 1.ti of the inoculums mix and PBS 1.5% NaC1 was added to a 1.8 ml Nunc tube followed by 900 ul of Biofreeze (Biochrom, Germany). The solution was gently mixed to obtain a homogenous mixture. Nunc tubes were then put in a  Styrofoam box with paper, to avoid rapid cooling, at -80  C before being put in sample box five hours later.

 14 A new passage (P3F) was used for DNA extraction following sequencing of the housekeeping genes. P3F and later passages were used in the phenotypical characterization of the isolates. All procedures involving handling of the bacterial isolates were performed in a sterile and safe environment provided by ScanLaf Mars Safety Class 2 (LaboGeneTM, Denmark) ventilation bench. Colony and cell morphology To examine CFUs and determine exact morphology, a magnifying glass was used.  The colonies were given time to grow so that proper morphological studies could be performed. Preferably, colonies measuring >1.0 mm in diameter was used for determining morphology. All isolates were gram-stained. This was done as follows; a 40 !al drop of deionised water was added to a microscopy slide. 1-2 colonies of cultures were added to the drop on the microscopy slide and streaked out gently. A sterile plastic bacterial loop (VWR, U.S.A.) was used when preparing slides for microscopy. The microscopy slide was left to dry at room temperature for 10 minutes. The slide was put in 100 %  methanol for 3 min, before being added drops of Gram's crystal violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) for 60 sec and then rinsed carefully with tap water.  Gram's iodine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was added for 60 sec following Gram's decolorizer solution (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) and counterstaining with Gram's safranin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) for the same amount of time. The microscopy slide was left to dry at room temperature for 10 min. A cover glass was placed on the slide and a drop of immersion oil (Sigma-Aldrich) added before examining the bacteria under light microscope at 10X100. In respect of colony morphology, examination of sub-cultured Piscirickettsia spp.  showed CFUs of the same characteristics as previously described by Mikalsen et al. (2008), Agar culture of Piscirickettsia salmon's, a serious pathogen of farmed salmonid and marine fish. FEMS microbiology letters 2008, 278(1):43-47.  Colonies were observed as slightly convex, grey¨white, shiny, and centrally opaque with translucent, slightly undulating margins (Mikalsen et al. (2008), supra). No distinctive colony morphology was observed for the different isolates included in present study. In respect of cell morphology, examination of the different Piscirickettsia spp.  isolates included in present study showed Gram-negative coccoid bacteria with a size of 0.4-1.8 um in diameter. No distinctive cell morphology was observed, and the varying cell-size applied to all of the isolates.     Media for growth studies In order to promote the growth of the fastidious P. salmonis isolates, an optimal standard growth medium had to be made for the phenotypic characterization. 5    Austral-TSFe (Yanez AJ, Silva H, Valenzuela K, Pontigo JP, Godoy M, Troncoso J, Romero A, Figueroa J, Carcamo JG, Avendano-Herrera R: Two novel blood-free solid media for the culture of the salmonid pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis.    Journal of fish diseases 2012) was modified three times replacing Sodium Chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) with 15 or 25 g L-1 of red sea salt (Red Sea, U.S.A). Glucose 10    concentration was increased to 6 g L-1 for the modifications containing  
 15 or 25 g L-1 of red sea salt. Additionally, a glucose concentration of 12 g L-1 was tested on the modification with 25 g L-1 red sea salt. Tryptic Soy Agar (BD DifcoTM, U.S.A) was modified to follow manufacturer's recommendation of 40 g L-1. Defibrinated sheep blood (Oxoid Limited, U.K) was added in a concentration of 5 % as a 15    supplement.

Ingredients 1-3 were autoclaved at 121  C for 15 min. Ingredient 4 was added directly after autoclave and agar was set to water bath at 80  C until chocolate brown in color. Subsequently the agar was cooled down to 50  C and ingredients 8 were added. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 0.2 before adding the agar in 22 ml portions to empty, sterile agar plates. The Austral-TSFe modification with 15 g L-1 of red sea salt and 6 g L-1 glucose was tested on all of the isolates except CA-9, 817 and 1850 which were included in the study at a later time. A small, translucent layer of bacteria could be seen the following day after plating out 100  I of the isolates 8079, 8765, 8558, 8465 and 8466 directly from frozen stock. Growth was confirmed at day two by a thicker  
 16 layer of bacteria, showing rapid growth for the latter Piscirickettsia sp.  isolates. No growth was observed for the isolates LF-89, 8741 and 8670. However, minor growth was observed when streaking out a generous sample of the latter three bacterial isolates. The addition of red sea salt to a total of 25 g L-1 seemed to have neither positive nor negative effects on the less fastidious isolates (8079, 8765, 8558, 8465 and 8466), and a minor positive effect was observed on the highly fastidious isolates (LF-89, 8741, 8670, CA-9, 817 and 1850) after streaking out a generous sample of bacteria. The Austral-TSFe modification with 25 g L-1 of red sea salt and 12 g L-1 glucose was tested on all of the isolates in present study. A negative effect with regard to growth was recorded for all of the isolates. No growth was observed for the highly fastidious isolates while minor growth was observed for the less fastidious isolates. SRS-BA promoted a very good growth for all of the isolates including the highly fastidious ones, indicating that cysteine which for this specific modification was increased by 100 % to 1 g L-1, may have been the limiting factor that inhibited growth in earlier modifications. Since growth was observed at both 15 and 25 g for earlier modifications, it was decided to test 20 g L-1 which didn't seem to have positive nor negative effect on any of the isolates, indicating that a salt range of 15-g L-1 may be used without significant change in growth. Temperature range 25    Three colonies measuring 1 mm in diameter were streaked out on SRS-BA  growth medium and incubated at the following temperatures; 8, 11, 16, 19, 22, 25 and C. Growth was recorded using the defined scale; no growth (-), little growth (+), moderate growth (++) and vigorous growth (+++) in accordance to Figure 1.  However, in cases where high densities of thriving bacteria were observed in a zone, statuses were adjusted positively (additional "+" added). Counting and measurement of the colonies was performed to provide additional data for a possible indication of optimum temperature for bacterial growth. Growth was recorded at day 3-7 and 10-14 for all of the isolates included in the present study. A summary showing recorded growth at the end of the experiment (day 14) is presented in Table 4. A weakly to positive growth status was recorded at the temperatures 16  C, 19 C  and 22 C after 3 days for all of the isolates. The strain 1D8079 (DSM 27338) was recorded as the fastest growing isolate in the experiment giving it a vigorous growth status at 22  C. Additionally, ID8079 (DSM 27338) was given vigorous growth status at 16  C and 19  C on day 5 and 6 respectively, making the isolate distinct  
 17 from the rest based solely on growth. The isolate 8558 was the only isolate recorded to grow at 25  C, and the type strain LF-89 was the only isolate not recorded to grow on 8  C. Overall it was apparent that the less fastidious Piscirickettsia ,sp.  isolates (8079, 8765, 8558, 8465 and 8466) grew better than the highly fastidious P.    salmonis isolates (LF-89, 8741, 8670, CA-9, 817 and 1850). The isolate 8558 produced the highest number of colonies counting 53, while the isolate 8466 produced the largest colonies measuring >3.2 mm. in diameter. It was apparent that the optimum temperature for maximum culture growth was in the range 19  C ¨ 22  C for the less fastidious isolates, and in the range 16 C ¨ 19 C for the highly fastidious isolates. Overall the isolates were recorded to have a growth temperature range of 8  C ¨ 25  C. No growth occurred at 37  C.

A summary of growth at termination of the experiment (day 14) is presented in Table 5. A weakly to positive growth status was recorded after 3 days on SRS-BA for all of the isolates. The weakly to positive growth was recorded until day 7 for all of the isolates on SRS-BA except 8079 which had a more rapidly growth giving it a moderate growth status at day 5. Of the P. salmonis isolates (LF-89, 8471, 8670, 817, 1850 and CA-9) positive growth on CHAB and CHAB w/Fe was only recorded for the type strain LF-89 starting at day 5-6. No growth was recorded on the other growth mediums for the fastidious isolates during the period of the experiment. Nor  
 19 was any growth recorded on MA and FLPA during the period of the experiment for the Piscirickettsia sp. isolates (8079, 8765, 8558, 8465 and 8466). The isolate 8558 did not grow on BA which was recorded as positive for the other less fastidious isolates. Additionally, the isolate 8465 did not grow on Austral-TSHem.  Vigorous growth was recorded on SRS-BA for the isolates 8079, 8765 and 8558 while on BA w/2% NaCI only for 8079. The isolate 8765 produced the highest number of colonies (64) measuring >2.5 mm. in diameter. On the basis of how long it took to form colonies, their numbers and size, the optimal growth medium was concluded to be SRS-BA for all of the isolates.

API ZYM test API ZYM kit (BioMerieux, U.S.A) for the detection of bacterial enzymes was used according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that incubation temperature was set at 19  C and incubation time at 24 h. A 6.0 McFarland standard (Appendix 2) 10    presented in manufacturer's protocol was made in advance for turbidity comparison. An overview of the results from the API ZYM test performed on the isolates is presented in Table 6. To expand the overall API ZYM profile image, results of three external isolates (NVI 5692, NVI 5910 (LF-89 like) and NVI 5786 (EM-90 like)) 15    presented by Mikalsen et al. (2008), supra were included for comparison.  Identical results were observed for all of the internal isolates when performing triplicate tests.

A comparison with the external isolates show that the isolates in present study do not vary much in profile for these specific enzymes. However, valine arylamidase was recorded as negative for the external isolates which was the opposite of what was recorded for the isolates in present study. Lipase (C14) was recorded as weakly positive for the 15    external isolates in comparison to a negative reaction for the internal isolates. Alkaline phosphatase was recorded as positive (CA-9, 8079, 8765, 8558, 8465, 8466) or weakly positive (LF-89, 8741, 8670, 817, 1850) for all of the isolates except the external isolate NVI 5692 where Mikalsen et al. (2008), supra, recorded 20    a very weak reaction in one of four replicate tests. Cystine arylamidase was recorded as positive for LF-89 and 8741 whereas recorded as negative for the rest of the isolates. Acid phosphatase was recorded as positive (LF-89, 8741, CA-9, 8079, 8765, 8558, 8465, 8466) or weakly positive (8670, 817, 1850) for all of the isolates  
 22 except the external isolate NVI 5910 which is presented as negative.  Additionally, the isolate NVI 5910 is presented as negative for Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase whereas the rest of the isolates are recorded as positive (LF-89, 8741, CA-9, 817, 1850, 8079, 8765, 8558, 8466) or weakly positive (8670, 8465). Interestingly, the isolate 8079 gave a positive (3/5) reaction for 0-ga1actosidase and a-glucosidase while the rest of the isolates gave negative results, making 8079 stand out with a unique profile for these specific enzymes. Agglutination test Agglutination test was performed on the isolates LF-89 and 8079. A volume of 5 pi of control serum and serum from experimentally P. salmonis (isolate ID449) challenged fish (Utne T: Challenge experiment with a putative low virulent Chilean Piscirickettsia salmonis field isolate and sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Bergen: University of Bergen; 2013) were added to a microscopy slide. A loop of bacteria was transferred to 100 p.I PBS and vortexed for 30 sec until a homogenous bacterial suspension was obtained. A 5 Ill sample of the bacterial suspension were added to the fish serum and gently spread out.  Additionally, 10 pl of the bacterial suspension were added to a microscopy slide to be used as a PBS control. The slides were examined in light microscope. The isolates LF-89 and 8079 agglutinated in all fish serums tested, including the control serum provided by MSD Animal Health. No agglutination was recorded when using PBS as a negative control.      Other tests The isolate disclosed herein was also subjected to antibiotic test, experiments studying the oxidative/fermentative production of acid from glucose, an indole test, a test for oxidase, catalase, and cefinase, respectively, and finally a H2S  test. For these tests, identical results where obtained for all of the isolates disclosed herein.    Example 2 Genotypic characterization DNA extraction In order to perform an optimized DNA extraction from a pure culture of P.      salmon's, E.Z.N.A Tissue DNA extraction kit was used with a modified kit protocol. Pure culture of P. salmonis was added to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 100 pi DEPC-water and vortexed for 30 sec to obtain a homogenous mix. First centrifugation step (5 min at 13.000 g) intended to pellet insoluble tissue debris, was not performed when working with the easily soluble colonies from pure culture. Elution was performed twice in 50 pi (10mM Tris, pf1=8.5) portions to  
 23 increase the overall DNA yield. DNA was taken immediately for evaluation of quality using NanoDrop and then stored in freezer at -20  C. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) PCR and sequencing was performed using specific primers for the 12 genes included in the study (Table 7). Amplification was based on a standard reaction mixture containing 5 p.1 10 X ThermoPol Buffer (BioLabs, New England), 1.5 units (0.3 I.11) Taq DNA polymerase (BioLabs, New England), 2.5 mM dNTP (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) , 10 !IM of forward and reverse primer (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.) and 2 ul DNA added Nuclease-Free water (Ambion, U.S.A.) or DNase, RNase free water (Sigma-Aldrich, U.K.) to a final solution of 50    Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 (Applied BioSystems) at 94  C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94  C for 30 sec (denaturation), 57.5  C for 30 sec (annealing (Tm)), 72 C for 2 min (synthesis) followed by 72  C for 8 min. A volume of 25 [11 of 1-step qPCR ROX mix (Thermo Scientific) was used for some of the isolates (8558, EM8765, EM8670, CA-9, 1D817, and 1D1850), replacing ThermoPol Buffer, dNTP and Taq DNA polymerase. First PCR step (polymerase activation) was performed at 95  C for 15 min when using 1-step qPCR ROX mix.  PCR product was then visualized by gel electrophoresis and purified in an Arktik Thermal Cycler (Thermo Scientific) at 37  C for 15 min and 80  C for 15 min, using a mixture of 1 IA ExoSap (Affymetrix , U.S.A.) added 2,5 1.11 PCR  product.

A volume of 10  1 of deionised water was added to each sample before delivery to the sequencing facility (High Technology Centre, http://www.uib.no/seqlab) where samples were cleaned with Agencourt CleannSeq (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) before being sequenced in a 96-capillary 3730x1 DNA  Analyzer (Applied Biosystemst). Vector NTT  v9.0 Software (Invitrogen) was used following AlignX for analyzing the sequences.    Phylogeny The phylogeny software PhyML v3.0 (Guindon S, Dufayard JF, Lefort V, Anisimova M, Hordijk W, Gascuel 0: New algorithms and methods to estimate maximum-likelihood phylogenies: assessing the performance of PhyML 3Ø      Systematic biology 2010, 59(3):307-321) based on the maximum-likelihood principle was used to create an unrooted phylogenetic tree for the isolates included in present study. The default generalized time-reversible (GTR) model (Tavare S:  Some Probabilistic and Statistical Problems in the Analysis of DNA Sequences.  In:     American Mathematical Society: Lectures on Mathematics in the Life Sciences.  vol.  17: Amer Mathematical Society; 1986: 57-86) was selected using the nearest neighbor interchanges (NNI) and approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) options. 5    Sequence alignment and percentage identity The sequences obtained were aligned in AlignX to visualize and analyze genetic variations. It was apparent that the isolates could be separated into three different groups (G1, G2- and G3/CA-9) based on genetic variation. The following isolates were placed within Gl; LF-89, 8741, 8670, 817, 1850 and G2; 8079, 8765, 8558, 10    8465, 8466. Phylogenetic branches were visualized using PhyML 3.0 (Figure 2) (Guindon et al.: New algorithms and methods to estimate maximum-likelihood phylogenies: assessing the performance of PhyML 3Ø Systematic biology 2010, 59(3):307-321). 15    An overview of variable positions is found in Table 8. A statistics report of percentage identity (PID) was made in GeneDoc (Karl Nicholas  2000) to determine similarities between the isolates. Table 8 Overview of the genotypic variables.

Comparison of 10 housekeeping sequences from the P. salmonis isolates in present study revealed 376 variable nt. positions across 11211 nucleotides (nts). The highest number of variable positions (4.9%) was seen in the tbpB and elfP locus and lowest  
 25    (0.2%) in tnpA. After the sequences were translated to proteins a total of 61 variable positions were revealed across a total of 3000 amino acids. The highest number of variable amino acid positions (4.2%) was seen in the tbpB locus and lowest (0%) in elfP. Although showing high genetic variation (4.9%) in nucleotides  
 26 for the elfP-gene, it was apparent that these mutations were neutral. PID was recorded to vary from 95 - 100 % when compared to the type-strain.

 28 Spectroscopic DNA-DNA Hybridization Cells were disrupted by using a Constant Systems TS 0.75 KW (JUL Instruments, Germany) and the DNA in the crude lysate was purified by chromatography on hydroxyapatite as described by Cashion et al. (1977), A rapid method for base ratio determination of bacterial DNA, Anal Bioehem 81, 461-466. DNA-DNA hybridization was carried out as described by De Ley et al. (1970), The quantitative measurement of DNA hybridization from renaturation rates. Eur J  Biochem 12, 133-142 under consideration of the modifications described by Huss et al. (1983), Studies on the spectrophotometric determination of DNA  hybridization from renaturation rates. Syst Appl Microbiol 4, 184-192 using a model Cary 100 Bio UV/VIS-spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostatted 6x6 multicell changer and a temperature controller with in-situ temperature probe (Varian). DNA-DNA-hybridization of strain LF (ID8079) against type strain LF89 was performed. The following results were obtained: % DNA-DNA similarity (in 2 X SSC at 65 C) strain LF89 strain ID (ID8079)                                 74.6 (77.2) (Values in parentheses are results of measurements in duplicate) Strain LF (ID 12-984) belongs to the same species as strain ID (ID 12-985) when the recommendations of a threshold value of 70 % DNA-DNA similarity for the definition of bacterial species by the ad hoc committee (Wayne et al., 1987, Report of the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics. Int J Syst Bacteriol 37, 463-464 ) are considered.    Example 3 Challenge experiment Pilot challenge studyA collection of Piscirickettsia isolates were obtained from different fish farms in Chile culturing Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Coho salmon (0. kisutch). All isolates were from fish showing signs of piscirickettsiosis. A selection of these isolates was used in a pilot challenge study of Atlantic salmon kept in fresh water at the facilities of The Industrial- and Aquatic Research Laboratory (ILAB) in Bergen. Fish groups kept in separate tanks were challenged using intraperitoneal injection (IP) of four different field isolates. Each isolate was injected at three different dosages; low, medium and high. The isolate chosen for this study showed a high virulence in the pilot study and is hereafter referred to as isolate ID8079.  
 29 The IDS 079 isolate were obtained from an aquaculture facility in Chiles region X  rearing Atlantic salmon. The facility experienced a disease outbreak with diagnostic signs consistent with SRS. ID 8079 had been through seven before being used in the challenge experiment described below. 1D8 079 was originally isolated from the liver of moribund fish. The isolate is genetically different from the type strain LF-89 according to 165 gene and housekeeping gene sequences. The isolate were stored in liquid nitrogen (at -196  C). Study design The challenge experiment using ID8079 was carried out at the facilities of ILAB, University of Bergen. The fish were kept in 150 liter (L) cubic fiberglass tanks, with lids that allowed some light to penetrate. The light was on for 12 hours a day, and automatically dimmed to simulate sunrise and sunset. Each tank had a constant water flow of approximately 375 L/hour, flowing into the tank above the water level, and draining off at the bottom through a strainer. To avoid problems with fish jumping out of the tank when opening the lid, approximately 1/3 of the water was flushed out before opening the lid. Fish that jumped out were killed and sampled.  Each tank was inspected at least twice a day, and dead and moribund fish were removed. The fish were fed to appetite by the staff at ILAB. Inlet water was pumped from 105 m below surface outside of Nordnes in Bergen.  The water was first passed through a drum filter with 20 p.m film before being treated with UV-light. Water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were measured from the drain water of each tank daily by ILAB. Before bacterial challenge (day 0), the water temperature varied between 11,2 C and 12,2 C.  During a four days period, at the start of the challenge, the temperature gradually increased to 15 C ( 0,5 C), where it was kept throughout the experimental period. The salinity was kept between 29.2 and 32.0%0 until 7 days before the start of the challenge, when it was increased to 34,3%0 ( 0,2) and it stayed at this level for the remaining period. Dissolved oxygen in drain water was measured to be between and 99%, with an average of 87.5 %. Experimental fish The Atlantic salmon smolts were produced by ILAB from eggs supplied by SalmoBreed AS, and kept at full sea water during the challenge period. The mean weight at the start of the experiment was approximately 50 grams. Screening Five months before the start of the experiment, the fish were screened by Real-time RT-PCR by PatoGen  for the following pathogens; Infectious Pancreas Necrosis Virus (IPNV), Infectious Salmon Anaemia Virus (ISAV) and Piscine Myocarditis Virus (PMCV) by PatoGen Analyse AS. All fish (n = 30) were negative. At day 0, gills from 10 fish were screened with real-time RT-PCR, for presence of the pathogens Piseirickettsia salmonis, Salmonid Alphavirus (S AV), Paranucleospora theridion, Ichthyobodo sp., Epitheliocystis (Candidatus Branchiomonas cysticola), Piscine Reovirus (PRV) and Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). One of the 5    ten fish was positive for Paranucleospora theridion, epitheliocystis and PRV with CT values of 33.0, 34.1 and 35.3 respectively. After the development of PSA-assay, kidney and gill tissue from 10 fish at day 0 were tested for the presence of P.  salmonis using this assay.     10    Test groups The groups of fish were challenged in three different ways: Intraperitoneal injection (IP), by cohabitation (naive test fish together with IP injected shedders), and by 15    cohabitation and salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). In addition there were two groups acting as negative control: one group with salmon lice and one group without. The control fish were treated in the same manner as the infected groups. They were, however, always the first tanks to be checked for mortality and sampled during sampling days.    Fish in two tanks (KL and HVL) were challenged with copepodids from salmon louse 14 days before the challenge with ID8079. This was carried out by lowering the water level in the tank to a minimum, followed by adding approximately copepodids (120 per fish). The copepodids were supplied by the Sea Lice Research Center at the University of Bergen, from an in-house strain. Table 10 Tank setup. Shedder fish were added on the day of salmonis infection while the test fish was added to the tanks three weeks before bacterial challenge.

Doses were estimated based on results from the pilot study and the titers were estimated by plating one dose on SRS-agar. The fish in the HVP group was given eight CFU, and the shedders in the HV and HVL groups were given 600 CFU. The control shedders were injected with 0.1 mL PBS-solution. The shedders in the control group can be regarded as a negative control for the IP groups. The injection site was about one pelvic fin length in front of the base of the pelvic fins, which comply with the recommendations from MSD Animal Health. Prior to injection, the fish were tranquilized using tricaine mesylate (FINQUEL  vet.). Shedders were marked by clipping off the adipose fin. Mortality Mortalities were registered twice a day, and cumulative mortality was calculated using the formula: IV d % Cumulative mortality =  ____________ x 180 Nt Nw where Nd is number of dead fish, Nt is the total number of fish at day 0 and Nw is the number of fish taken for weekly sampling.    Sampling The original plan was to sample 5 fish at day 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56 and 63.  However, due to high mortality sampling was not executed as planned. Conducted samplings are listed in table 3 below. The experiment was terminated between day 69 and 72, when all remaining fish were sampled.

Clinical and pathological signs were registered during necropsy. All the fish were killed by a blow to the head immediately before sampling to avoid autocatalytic degradation of the tissue. Samples were put directly on ice after extraction, and were later transferred to ¨30 C. Blood samples were stored in a microcentrifuge tube overnight, before centrifugation (3500 rpm, 4 C, 5 minutes), and transferring of the serum to a new tube, stored at ¨30 C. Tissue samples for real-time RT-PCR were taken from all fish (in chronological order): Skin/muscle, gill (2nd gill arch), spleen, liver, head kidney, heart (ventricle), CNS (cerebellum) and hindgut. Only head kidney was sampled from the shedders and dead fish. For each tissue a sample of approximately 3.0 mm3 was stored in a microcentrifuge tube at ¨30 C. A larger sample of the respective tissues was stored in a Nunc container at -80 C as backup. For the groups with lice, the lice were sampled and stored at --80 C. From selected fish (at least one of the five taken out on the sampling days), samples for histology were taken from the following tissues: Gills (1st gill arch), spleen, liver, head kidney, heart and CNS. The samples were immediately placed in Karnovsky fixative and stored at 4  C. The major clinical and pathological findings are summarized in table 12 below: Table 12: Overview of mortality and different clinical and pathological signs observed in this trial.

A high prevalence of fin erosion was observed in all groups including controls.  In the two groups infected with salmon lice (HVL & KL), a higher prevalence of lower lip lesions (cf. table 12) was observed.     The mortality in all challenge groups reached 100%, see figure 3. Both the IF-group (HVP) and the cohabitant without sea lice group (HV) had a mortality period which proceeded rapidly to >90%. The cohabitant with sea lice group (HVL) experienced a 64% cumulative mortality within the first 8 days after the addition of shedders. The cumulative mortality in control groups were 25%  in the group with sea lice (KL) and 8.5% in the group without sea lice (K) at the end of the trial. Taking in to consideration the foimula used and the number of samplings in the control groups compared with the challenge groups (cf. table 1), the cumulative mortality in controls quickly reaches a high percentage as a result of a relatively high number of fish taken out for weekly samplings.      Example 4 Immunization trial In order to investigate the Immunization abilities of the Piscirickettsia salmonis isolate ID 8079 the bacteria were used in a vaccine trial. The bacteria was inactivated and formulated into a vaccine by known methods and transferred to the Atlantic salmon by intraperitoneal injection, in order to produce an immune response. The test fish was subsequently challenged with the P. salmonis isolate ID 8079. The appropriate number non-immunized control fish was also challenged with the same isolate and worked as a positive control. During the challenge experiment, mortality and clinical signs was monitored in all groups and samples for qPCR and bacteriology was taken of all mortalities and moribund fish. An appropriate number of fish was sampled to measure immune response by antibody response. The challenge experiment lasted until the positive control group reached the appropriate mortality.
