 By above-mentioned series embodiment, according to by Hanshan Normal College, phoenix is single from Guangdong Province, Raoping County, Chaozhou town Fu Bin
It is sampled in clump tea free, sample is the leaf of tea tree, is collected in Guangdong Province, Raoping County, Chaozhou town Fu Bin, the age of tree 15,25 and 50 years, plants
Height above sea level 750m is planted, tea tree breed is phoenix Dan Congcha narcissus, organic plantation, by isolating in leaf using homogenate rubbing method
Endogenetic bacteria filters out the well-grown bacterium bacterial strain of a batch using different cultivation temperatures, pH value, culture medium as enrichment condition,
Therefrom preferably go out the bacterial strain that one plant of number is ZF05.By according to the above morphological feature, reference " primary Jie Shi Bacteria Identification handbook "
8th edition and " common bacteria identification handbook " carry out taxonomic identification to bacterial strain, and binding molecule biology is sequenced, and Preliminary Identification should
Bacterial strain is Serratieae (Serratia sp.).Molecule sequencing result shows Serratieae (Serratia sp.) ZF05GDMCC
The 16SrDNA gene order of No.60015 is 1443bp, with ncbi database Serratia marcescens NBRC 102204
(NR_114043.1) homology highest, most No.60015 and common bacteria culture have apparent physio-biochemical characteristics difference and
The otherness of molecular level, according to strain Analysis of The Physiological And Biochemical Properties, the comprehensive identification of molecular level analysis and systematics,
The strain that number is ZF05 has apparent difference with common Serratieae in terms of physio-biochemical characteristics and molecular level, is
A kind of typical novel bacterial is different from common Serratieae (Serratia sp.), right compared with common bacteria culture
The operatic circle alternaria, walnut leaf spoting bacteria, jujube alternaria, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn and melon and fruit it is rotten it is mould have bacteriostasis but according to
According to strain Analysis of The Physiological And Biochemical Properties, molecular level is analyzed and the comprehensive identification of systematics, the strain that number is ZF05 are
Serratieae (Serratia sp.). 
 The above embodiment is merely an example for clearly illustrating the present invention, and does not limit the embodiments.
For those of ordinary skill in the art, other various forms of variations can also be made on the basis of the above description
Or it changes.There is no necessity and possibility to exhaust all the enbodiments.And the obvious variation thus extended
