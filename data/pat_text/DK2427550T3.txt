 DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 
 [0013] Beer is traditionally referred to as an alcoholic beverage derived from malt, such as malt derived from barley, and optionally adjuncts, such as cereal grains, and flavoured with hops. Included within the term "beer" is any fermented wort, produced by the brewing and fermentation of a starch-containing material, mainly derived from cereal grains, such as malted barley. Wheat, maize, and rice may also be used. 
 [0014] As used herein, the term "malt beverage" includes such foam forming fermented malt beverages as full malted beer, ale, dry beer, near beer, light beer, low alcohol beer, low calorie beer, porter, bock beer, stout, malt liquor, non-alcoholic malt liquor and the like. The term "malt beverages" also includes non-foaming beer and alternative malt beverages such as fruit flavoured malt beverages, e. g. , citrus flavoured, such as lemon-, orange-, lime-, or berry-flavoured malt beverages, liquor flavoured malt beverages, e. g. , vodka-, rum-, or tequila-flavoured malt liquor, or coffee flavoured malt beverages, such as caffeine-flavoured malt liquor, and the like. 
 [0015] Beer can be made from a variety of grains by essentially the same process. All grain starches are glucose homopolymers in which the glucose residues are linked by either alpha-1, 4- or alpha-1,6-bonds, with the former predominating. 
 [0016] The process of making fermented malt beverages is commonly referred to as brewing. The principal raw materials used in making these beverages are water, hops and malt. In addition, adjuncts such as common corn grits, refined corn grits, brewer's milled yeast, rice, sorghum, refined corn starch, barley, barley starch, dehusked barley, wheat, wheat starch, torrified cereal, cereal flakes, rye, oats, potato, tapioca, and syrups, such as corn syrup, sugar cane syrup, inverted sugar syrup, barley and/or wheat syrups, and the like may be used as a source of starch. The starch will eventually be converted into dextrins and fermentable sugars. 
 [0017] For a number of reasons, the malt, which is produced principally from selected varieties of barley, has the greatest effect on the overall character and quality of the beer. First, the malt is the primary flavouring agent in beer. Second, the malt provides the major portion of the fermentable sugar. Third, the malt provides the proteins, which will contribute to the body and foam character of the beer. Fourth, the malt provides the necessary enzymatic activity during mashing. 
 [0018] Hops also contribute significantly to beer quality, including flavouring. In particular, hops (or hops constituents) add desirable bittering substances to the beer. In addition, the hops act as protein precipitants, establish preservative agents and aid in foam formation and stabilization. 
 [0019] The process for making beer is well known in the art, but briefly, it involves five steps: (a) mashing and/or adjunct cooking (b) wort separation and extraction (c) boiling and hopping of wort (d) cooling, fermentation and storage, and (e) maturation, processing and packaging. 
 [0020] Typically, in the first step, milled or crushed malt is mixed with water and held for a period of time under controlled temperatures to permit the enzymes present in the malt to convert the starch present in the malt into fermentable sugars. 
 [0021] In the second step, the mash is transferred to a "lauter tun" or mash filter where the liquid is separated from the grain residue. This sweet liquid is called "wort" and the left over grain residue is called "spent grain". The mash is typically subjected to an extraction, which involves adding water to the mash in order to recover the residual soluble extract from the spent grain. 
 [0022] In the third step, the wort is boiled vigorously. This sterilizes the wort and helps to develop the colour, flavour and odour. Hops are added at some point during the boiling. 
 [0023] In the fourth step, the wort is cooled and transferred to a fermentor, which either contains the yeast or to which yeast is added. The yeast converts the sugars by fermentation into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas; at the end of fermentation the fermentor is chilled or the fermentor may be chilled to stop fermentation. The yeast flocculates and is removed. 
 [0024] In the last step, the beer is cooled and stored for a period of time, during which the beer clarifies and its flavour develops, and any material that might impair the appearance, flavour and shelf life of the beer settles out. Prior to packaging, the beer is carbonated and, optionally, filtered and pasteurized. 
 [0025] After fermentation, a beverage is obtained which usually contains from about 2% to about 10% alcohol by weight. The non-fermentable carbohydrates are not converted during fermentation and form the majority of the dissolved solids in the final beer. 
 [0026] This residue remains because of the inability of malt amylases to hydrolyze the alpha-1,6-linkages of the starch. The non-fermentable carbohydrates contribute about 50 calories per 12 ounces of beer. 
 [0027] Recently, there has been a widespread popularization of brewed beverages called light beers, reduced calorie beers or low calorie beers, particularly in the U. S. market. As defined in the U. S., these beers have approximately 30% fewer calories than a manufacturer's "normal" beer.

 [0137] LAMINEX® Super is a brewing enzyme product to be used in the mash to assist in lautering or mash filtration. The LAMINEX® Super product is a blend of two different fermentation enzyme products - the Penicillium funiculosum Cellulase and the Trichoderma reesei Cellulase. LAMINEX® Super is obtained from Danisco A/S. The Penicillium funiculosum component is included to hydrolyse solubilised β-glucans and xylans, reducing wort viscosity and improving lautering or mash filtration; the Trichoderma reesei component is included to get a low measured (by the Megazyme Mixed-linkage Beta-glucan assay procedure) β-glucan in the wort and to increase beer filtration rate. 
 [0138] LAMINEX® BG - T. reesei product(s) used to improve beer filtration obtained from Danisco A/S.

 Micro, specs will be standard 
 Stabilised with 0.25 % sodium benzoate. 
 [0141] The LAMINEX® XG is defined as being made up of: an enzyme complex derived from a combination of an expression product obtained by fermentation of the species Trichoderma reesei and an expression product obtained by fermentation of the species Penicillium funiculosum, wherein the ratio of beta-1,4-endoglucan hydrolase activity derived from Penicillium funiculosum and from Trichoderma reesei is about 0.25/0.75 to 0.37/0.63, such as an enzyme complex wherein: about 2363 u/g (activity measured by "Assay 1") is derived from Penicillium funiculosum concentrate; and about 5315 u/g (activity measured by "Assay 1") is derived from Trichoderma reesei. In this particular embodiment, the LAMINEX® XG product gives a Penicillium funiculosum/ Trichoderma ratio of 0.31/0.69 based on activity U as measured by "Assay 1" as described under "Assays". EXAMPLE 1 
 Lab scale mash study 1 
 Enzyme activities: [0142] LAMINEX® Super product mixed for this specific experiment: 
 Nominal activity: 3937 CMC U/g. Measured activity: 3682 CMC U/g (activity measured by method "Assay 1") dosed at 0.2kg/ton grist giving 736400 CMC U/ton grist (= 0.736 U/g grist). 
 [0143] Giving the LAMINEX® Super product definition of 0.40 x P. funiculosum product and 0.60 x T. reesei product based on CMC activity as measured by "Assay 1": • activity contribution from P. funiculosum - 0.295 CMC U/g grist • activity contribution from T. reesei - 0.442 CMC U/g grist. 
 [0144] LAMINEX® Super (0.200 kg/ton grist) + 50% activity of the T. reesei component (The LAMINEX® XG): 3682 CMC U/g (activity measured by "Assay 1") dosed at 0.2kg/ton grist + 0.09534 g T. reesei component (12539 CMC U/g, by "Assay 1")/g LAMINEX® Super product giving 975494 CMC U/ton grist (= 0.975 U/g grist) • activity contribution from P. funiculosum - 0.295 CMC U/g grist • activity contribution from T. reesei - (0.442 + 0.239) CMC U/g = 0.681 CMC U/g grist. P. funiculosumIT. reesei contribution ratio in The LAMINEX® XG lab scale mash study 1 - 0.30/0.70 [0145] Testing LAMINEX® Super (0.200 kg/ton grist) vs LAMINEX® Super (0.200 kg/ton grist) + 50% activity of the T. reesei component in a 10% Fawcett's barley mash (90% Fawcett's malt: 10% Fawcett's barley): - 50 g grist in total 250 g water. Mashing profile: 50 g mixed grist ground at 0.5 mm was used and 190 ml water at 67 °C was added. The mashing temperature cycle was 60 minutes at 65 °C, then 10 minutes at 72 °C. The mashes were then cooled, made up to 250 g weight and filtered through fluted filter papers (Ederol 12). 
 [0146] Compared to the LAMINEX® Super product the enzyme solution of LAMINEX® Super (0.200 kg/ton grist) with the 50% added extra activity of the T. reesei component showed: • Reduced wort residual β-glucan (see figure 1) 
 Reduced wort residual β-glucan indicates a potential for reduced viscosity and following increased wort separation/filtration and a potential of increase in brew cycles/day • Increased filtration (see figure 1) increased filtration indicated the positive potential of an increased length of filtration cycles without interruptions (e. g. racking) which in turn could decrease total filtration time and thus result in an increase in brew cycles/day EXAMPLE 2 (not in accordance with the invention) 
 Lab scale mash study 2 
 Enzyme activities: [0147] LAMINEX® Super: 4380 CMC U/g (activity calculated from single component contribution) dosed at 0.2 kg/ton grist giving 876000 CMC U/ton grist (= 0.876 U/g grist). P. funiculosum component contributing with 2069 CMC U/g (by "Assay 1") corresponding to 0.414 CMC U/g grist. T. reesei component contributing with 2311 CMC U/g (by "Assay 1") corresponding to 0.462 CMC U/g grist. 
 The P. funiculosum/T. reesei contribution ratio to the LAMINEX® Super product in this study is O. 47/0.52. 
 [0148] The LAMINEX® XG (LAMINEX® Super 1.5 times concentrated + an additional extra 50% activity of the T. reesei component): 8304 CMC U/g (activity calculated from single component contribution) dosed at 0.133 kg/ton grist giving 1104432 CMC U/ton grist (= 1.104 U/g grist). P. funiculosum component contributing with 3104 CMC U/g (by "Assay 1") corresponding to O. 413 CMC U/g grist T. reesei component contributing with 5200 CMC U/g (by "Assay 1") corresponding to 0.692 CMC U/g grist P. funiculosum/T. reesei contribution ratio in LAMINEX® XG lab scale mash study 2 - 0.37/0.63 [0149] Testing of LAMINEX® Super (0.200 kg/ton grist) vs LAMINEX® XG (0.133 kg/ton grist) in mixed grist - 25.8% Spitz malt and 74.2% Pilsner malt - mash. Mash profile: 50 g grist was mashed in with 150 g water and the mash program given in Table 1 was followed: 
 Table 1. Lab scale mash program: 
 
 
 [0150] At the end of mashing 30 ml hot water (at 76 °C) was added to each mash and the mashes were filtered hot using Ederol 12 filter papers. 
 [0151] Compared to the LAMINEX® Super product (dosed 0.2 kg/ton grist) the enzyme solution of LAMINEX® XG (dosed 0.133 kg/ton grist) showed: • Reduced residual wort β-glucan concentrations (see Figure 2) 
 The importance of reducing the wort β-glucan concentration is not clear, however theories associate reduced wort β-glucan with reduced wort viscosities. With mash separation as the bottleneck of the brewing process the resulting positive increase could increase brew house capacity by increasing number of brew cycles/day due to the decreased time spent on mash separation. • Increased filtration volumes over time (see Figure 2) 
 Higher filtration rates positively decreases time spent on filtration, potentially resulting in an increase in brew house capacity by increasing the number of brew cycles/day. • Reduced wort viscosity (see Figure 2) 
 Reduced wort viscosity has the positive potential of increasing filtration rates and thus increasing brew house capacity. EXAMPLE 3 (not in accordance with the invention) 
 Pilot Brewery trials [0152] Same enzyme compositions as in lab scale mash study 2. 
 [0153] Testing The LAMINEX® Super (0.200 kg/ton grist equivalent) and LAMINEX® XG (LAMINEX® Super 1.5 times concentrated + an additional 50% extra activity if the T. reesei component) (0.133 kg/ton grist). The pilot brewery mashing study was conducted using 31 kg mixed grist - 25.8% Spitz malt and 74.2% Pilsner malt - in a mash volume of 110 L. Mashing profile is seen in Table 2. 
 Table 2. Pilot brewery mashing profile: 
 
 
 
 Pilot brewery mashing trials [0154] In comparison to LAMINEX® Super addition of LAMINEX® XG in the mashing process results in: • Decreased sparging time by up to 13 % (see Table 3) 
 Decreased sparging time contributes positively to a decreased time spent on wort separation and thus is a potential for increased brewhouse capacity by an increase in number of brew cycles/day. • Decreased total lautering time by up to 8 % as compared to LAMINEX® Super and up to 20% as compared to water control (no enzyme added) (see Table 3 and Figure 3). 
 With the lautering process being the bottleneck of the brewing process, decreasing lautering time has the potential of boosting the brewhouse capacity by increasing the number of brew cycles/day. • increased average flow rate either calculated as the average of the flow rates measure "continuously" during the lautering process or as the "Total volume filtered" per the "Total time of lautering" (see Table 3 and Figure 3). 
 Increased average flow rate could positively decrease total time spent on wort separation and thus potentially increase brew house capacity. • decreased average ΔΡ across the filter bed by up to 19 % during the lautering process (see Table 3). 
 Potentially, a decreased average ΔΡ across the filter bed could result in a decreased need for filter bed racking and increase volume filtered over time. Both factors have the positive potential of decreasing lautering time and thus increasing brew house capacity • decreased pressure build up during the mash recirculation over filter bed (by up to 22 %) and during lautering (by up to 24 %) (see Table 3) 
 Both decreased pressure build during recirculation and lautering have the potential of contributing to increased filtration and thus decreased total lautering time. Again this could result in increased brew house capacity. The effect seen is especially strong as an increased rate of filtration would normally be linked to an increase in pressure - and the present data show increase in filtration and at the same a decrease pressure build up. • no change in wort haze (see Table 3) 
 That haze is unchanged, which is positive as an increased haze could be a factor resulting in the choice of induction of raking. Racking is time consuming and would increase total time of wort separation and thus decreased brew house capacity. • decreased "total pressure build up" during lautering by up to 24 % (see Table 3 and figure 3). Decreased "total pressure build up" during wort separation would increase filtration rate and 
 
 thus increased brew house capacity by decreased time spent on the wort separation process. • absence of filter bed racking induced by pressure build up. As marked by (1) in bottom of see Table 3 only the obligatory racking was introduced when including the LAMINEX® XG at the mashing step (marked by (1) in Table 3). 
 Decreasing the sparging time contributes to decrease in total lautering time and a potential increase in the number of brew cycles/day. 
 Table 3. Pilot brewery mashing trials - summary of lautering data 
 
 [0155] Wort sample analyses of mashes added the LAMINEX® XG in the mashing process results in: 
 
 • decreased wort β-glucan as measured by the Megazyme Mixed Linkage Beta-Glucan Method (Megazyme catalogue reference K-BGLU complying with standard AOAC Method 995.16) (see Table 4). 
 Decreased wort residual β-glucan could result in a positive decrease in wort viscosity, thus increasing filtration and brew house capacity by increasing the number of brew cycles/day. • increased extract by up to 2.3 % (see Table 4). 
 An increase in extract would give a positive increase in brew house yield - more product produced from the same amount of raw material - in other terms an increased brew house capacity in a more cost efficient way. 
 Table 4. Pilot brewery wort analyses: 
 
 Pilot brewery beer filtration [0156] In comparison to LAMINEX® Super addition of the LAMINEX® XG in the mashing process results in: • Increased flow rate during beer filtration (see Table 5). 
 Increased flow rate during beer filtration has the positive effect of increasing filtration capacity and thus potentially decrease (limit) the needs for extra bright beer tank (BBT) capacity (BBT are pressure tanks used for beer storage after filtration until filling. These tanks are able to keep a stable pressure, avoid loss of carbon dioxide and prevent the formation of foam). • Significantly decrease in pressure build up across filter over time (see Table 5). Decrease in pressure build up across filter over time positively increases the length of the filtration cycle between cleaning. This positively limits cleaning in place, the water and energy consumption. Also the amount filter material needed is decreased resulting in cost savings. Longer filtration cycles between cleaning positively reduce the loss of beer coming from start up and stop of beer filtration process. 
 Table 5. Summary of pilot brewery beer filtration data: 
 
 
 Pilot brewery beer analyses [0157] Analyses of beer produced from mashes added the LAMINEX® XG in the mashing process show: • decreased beer beta-glucan (see Table 6) 
 Decreased beer β-Glucan could positively decrease beer viscosity and thereby increase the filtration cycle and reduce the filter aid and utility consumption (cost saving). • Decreased beer haze (see Table 6). 
 The major contributor to beer haze can be related to non beta-glucan material. Reduced beer β-glucan could also contribute positively to decreased beer haze, giving a positive appearance of the beer. • No decrease in foam stability (see Table 6 - Head retention value) 
 Beer foam stability was not decreased using the "LAMINEX® Super 1.5 times cone + additional 50% extra activity of the T. reesei component". This is positive as it would be a compromising factor in regard to beer appearance and quality. • Decreased beer pentosans could be expected 
 Decreased beer pentosans could contribute positively to increased beer filtration

 Line 1 trial: [0158] Trial was running on a 31.6 % Barley grist composition using 9500 kg of grist per brew (3000 kg Barley, 6500 kg Malt). 
 [0159] As demonstrated by table 7, good results were observed with LAMINEX® XG with respect to mash separation. Decreasing lautering time has the potential of boosting the brewhouse capacity by increasing the number of brew cycles/day.

 Line 2 trial: [0160] Trial was running on a 28 % Barley grist composition using 12300 kg of grist per brew (3500 kg Barley, 8800 kg Malt). 
 [0161] As demonstrated by Table 8, good results were observed with LAMINEX® XG with respect to Beer filtration. • Increasing beer filtration cycles between cleaning has the potential of boosting the brewhouse capacity by decreasing the time spent on cleaning and increasing the number of beer filtration brew cycles/day. Also, increasing beer filtration cycles result in cost saving and reduced energy consumption and reduced the loss of beer coming from start up and stop of beer filtration. • Reduce the filter aid and utility consumption (reduced kieselguhr consumption) result in a direct cost saving. 
 Table 8. Brewhouse performance on Beer filtration. 
 
 • As presented in Table 9 analyses of beer produced from Line 2 added the LAMINEX® XG in the mashing process showed: Decreased beer beta-glucan. 
 Decreased beer β-Glucan could positively decrease beer viscosity and thereby increase the filtration cycle and reduce the filter aid and utility consumption (cost saving). • Reduced beer pentosans could be expected. 
 Decreased beer pentosans could contribute positively to increased beer filtration by reducing viscosity. • Reduced beer dynamic viscosity 
 Reduced beer viscosity could positively increase filtration cycles and reduce the filter aid and utility consumption (cost saving). Increased filtration cycles could also increase brew house capacity by increasing number of beer filtration cycles/day

 Assays 
 Assays 1: DNS Cellulase activity method (DNS CMC method) [0163] 
 Systematic Name: 1,4-(1,3;1,4)-3-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase IUB Number: EC 3.2.1.4 
 Principle [0164] The assay of cellulase is based on the enzymatic endo-hydrolysis of the 1,4-β-ϋ-glucosidic bonds in carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a β-1,4-glucan. The products of the 
 
 
 reaction (β-1,4 glucan oligosaccharides) was determined colorimetrically by measuring the resulting increase in reducing groups using a 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent. Enzyme activity was calculated from the relationship between the concentration of reducing groups, as glucose equivalents, and absorbance at 540nm. 
 [0165] The assay was carried out at pH 5.0, but it can be performed at different pH values for the additional characterisation and specification of enzymes. 
 Unit definition [0166] One unit of cellulase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme which produces 1 pmole glucose equivalents per minute under the conditions of the assay (pH 5.0 (or as specified) and 50 °C).

 Assay 2. Endo-1.4-B-xvlanase (DNS birchwood xvlan method) 
 
 Principle [0173] The reaction, catalysed by endo-1,4-3-xylanase, involves the endohydrolysis of the 1,4-β-D-xylosidic bonds in xylan (e.g. birchwood xylan or cereal substituted xylans such as wheat arabinoxylan) forming β-1,4 xylan oligosaccharides. 
 [0174] The products of the reaction (β-ΙΛ-χγΙθη oligosaccharides) was determined colorimetrically by measuring the resulting increase in reducing groups using a 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent. Enzyme activity is calculated from the relationship between the concentration of reducing groups, as xylose equivalents, and absorbance at 540nm. 
 [0175] The standard assay was carried out at pH 3.5, but it can be performed at different pH values for the additional characterisation and specification of enzymes.

 Arabinase standard solution (0.50 mg/ml) 
 Procedure [0190] The enzyme complex was diluted into samples and a glucose standard curve was made using arabinase concentrations of 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, and 0.5 mg/ml. 
 [0191] 0.25 ml of enzyme solution was mixed with 1.75 ml of the substrate solution (1.5% w/v) at 50 °C and the reaction was stopped after 10 min by addition of DNS solution. Followed by heating to 95 °C for 5 minutes.

 Assay 5. Arabinofuranosidase assay. 
 [0195] The reaction, catalysed by α-N-arabinofuranosidase, involves the hydrolysis of the terminal bond, at the non-reducing α-L-arabinofuranoside residue, of α-L-arabinosides. The enzyme acts on a-L-arabinofuranosides, α-L-arabinans containing (1,3)- and/or (1,5)-linkages, arabinoxylans and arabinogalactans. 
 [0196] The assay of α-N-arabinofuranosidase is based upon the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside. The assay is a "two-point", rather than a "continuous monitoring", method. The calculation of enzyme activity is based on measurements taken only at the beginning and end of the incubation period. A product of the reaction, p-nitrophenol is determined colourimetrically (after pH adjustment). Enzyme activity is calculated from the relationship between the concentration of p-nitrophenol and absorbance at400nm. 
 Preparation of diluted enzyme solution: 
 [0197] Prepare all enzyme solutions, from powder or liquid enzyme preparations, with glass distilled water. Minimise assay dilution errors by avoiding large dilution steps involving small volumes or weights. In making enzyme dilutions it is more accurate, even for a liquid sample, to weigh out the initial enzyme sample. If this is done, in the case of liquid samples it is therefore necessary to measure the specific gravity of the liquid at 20 °C 
 [0198] As the assay is a "two-point", rather than a "continuous monitoring", method it is important to ensure the linearity within the incubation period with different enzyme systems and conditions. Under the standard assay conditions of substrate concentration, pH, temperature and assay time the assay has been demonstrated to be linear in the range AOD^onm TEST (T) = 0.20 - 1.50. However, for good practice, the assay is operated within a defined range of AOD540nm TEST (T) = 0.400 - 0.800. 
 Procedure [0199] Each enzyme sample assay involves three analyses: duplicate test (TEST) analyses and a blank (BLANK) analysis. The procedure given describes the analysis of a single enzyme sample. 
 
 [0200] 0.25 ml diluted enzyme solution was added to the solutions at 50 °C, the reaction was stopped after 10 minutes by addition of 4 ml of 0.4M glycine solution, pH 10.8 (stop reagent). 
 [0201] Absorbance was measured at 400 nm at 25 °C against a water blank. • determine OD4oonm TEST for the duplicate TESTS measured; • determine OD4oonm BLANK.

 where: T = OD400nm TEST - OD400nm BLANK 18300 = Molar extinction coefficient for p-nitrophenol (1 cm path length) V = 7.25 (total liquid volume in test in ml) t = 10 (minutes) 1 u = 1 pmol.min-1 E = 0.25 (volume of diluted enzyme sample in ml) D = Enzyme dilution factor e.g. for 1 ml diluted to 1 litre D = 1000) 
 Assay 6. cellobiohydrolase assay. 
 
 
 Principle [0203] The reaction, catalysed by cellobiohydrolase, involves the hydrolysis of 1,4-β-Ο-glucosidic linkages in cellulose and cellotetraose, releasing cellobiose from the non-reducing ends of the chains. 
 [0204] The assay of cellobiohydrolase is based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl β-D-cellobiopyranoside. The product of the reaction, p-nitrophenol is determined colorimetrically (after pH adjustment). Enzyme activity is calculated from the relationship between the concentration of p-nitrophenol and absorbance at 400nm. 
 [0205] The assay is operated within the linear defined range of AOD^onm TEST (T) = 0.400 -0.800. 
 Procedure [0206] Each enzyme sample assay involves three analyses: duplicate test (TEST) analyses and a blank (BLANK) analysis. The procedure given describes the analysis of a single enzyme sample. 
 
 [0207] 0.25 ml diluted enzyme solution was added to the test solution at 50 °C, after 30 minutes 4 ml of 0.4M glycine solution, pH 10.8 (stop reagent) was added to each tube. 
 [0208] Absorbance was measured at 20°C at 400 nm in a 1cm glass cuvette against a water blank. • determine OD400nm TEST for the duplicate TESTS measured; • determine OD400nm BLANK. 
 Calculation 
 
 
 where: T = OD^Onm TEST - OD^Onm BLANK 18300 = Molar extinction coefficient for p-nitrophenol (1 cm path length) V = 7.25 (total liquid volume in test in ml) 1000 = to convert to litres 106 = to convert to pmoles t = 30 (minutes) 1 u = 1 pmol.min"1 E = 0.25 (volume of diluted enzyme sample in ml) D = Enzyme dilution factor e.g. for 1 ml diluted to 1 litre D = 1000) 
 Assay 7. β-qlucanase assay. 
 Principle [0210] The reaction, catalysed by endo-1,3(4)-3-glucanase, involves the endohydrolysis of 1,3- or 1,4- glucosidic bonds in β-D-glucans when the glucose residue, whose reducing group is involved in the bond to be hydolysed, is itself substituted at C-3. Substrates include cereal β-D-glucans, laminarin and lichenin. By definition this enzyme is different from EC 3.2.1.39 (endo-1,3-3-glucanase, or laminarinase). 
 [0211] The assay of endo-1,3(4)-3-glucanase is based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of the 1,3-or 1,4- glucosidic bonds in barley β-glucan, a β-1,3(4)-glucan. The products of the reaction (β-1,3(4)-glucan oligosaccharides) are determined colourimetrically by measuring the resulting increase in reducing groups using a 3,5-dintrosalicylic acid reagent. Enzyme activity is calculated from the relationship between the concentration of reducing groups, as glucose equivalents, and absorbance at 540nm. 
 
 [0212] In this assay after the addition and mixing of the DNS reagent the assay tubes are put into a boiling water bath (95 °C minimum) and incubated for exactly 15 minutes. This is in contrast to DNS based enzyme assays with other substrates in which the incubation period is 5 minutes. This change also affects the range of AOD^onm TEST(T) values that are acceptable in the test. 
 [0213] Whilst the standard assay is carried out at pH 5.0, it can be performed at different pH values for the additional characterisation and specification of enzymes. In this case only the pH of the buffer solutions (noted below) is changed. 
 Reagents required [0214] In all cases, except for the Beta-glucan, it is the identity and purity of the reagents, and not the supplier, which are important.
