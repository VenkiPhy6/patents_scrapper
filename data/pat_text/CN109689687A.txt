 Embodiment 5:HGF competition detection 
 
 It is above-mentioned analysis shows, by some/epitope that identifies of mouse anti-MET antibody of equal value may in HGF combination MET and
The overlapping of epitope that HGF is related to (Stamos et al., EMBO magazine, 23 phases, 2325-2335 pages, 2004 (Stamos et al.,
EMBO J.23,2325-2335,2004)；Merchant et al., National Academy of Sciences proceeding, 110 phases, E2987-2996 pages,
2013 (Merehant et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110, E2987-2996,2013)；Basilico etc.
People, clinical investigation magazine, 124 phases, 3172-3186 pages, 2014 (Basilico et al., J Clin Invest.124,
3172-3186,2014)).In order to be studied along this line, we are tested competing between mAb and HGF by ELISA
It strives.Using NHS-LC- biotin (Thermo Scientific), in the end N- by recombined human and mouse HGF (R&D
Systems) biotinylation.People or mouse MET-Fc albumen (R&D Systems) are fixed in solid phase, then increasing concentration
The biotinylated people of 0.3nM or mouse HGF are exposed in the presence of the antibody of (0-120nM).The strepto- being conjugated using HRP is affine
Plain (Sigma-Aldrich) discloses the HGF in conjunction with MET.As shown in table 13, which allows the anti-MET of people/mouse equivalence
MAb is divided to for two groups: complete HGF competitor (71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,71G2) and part HGF competitor (76H10,
71G3、76G7、71G12、74C8、72F8)。 
 Table 13: pass through the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence of ELISA measurement and the ability of HGF competitive binding MET.It will
(people or mouse) MET-Fc chimeric protein is fixed in solid phase, and it is dense that fixation is then exposed in the presence of the antibody of increasing concentration
The biotinylation HGF (people or mouse) of degree.The HGF in conjunction with MET is disclosed using the Streptavidin of HRP conjugation.Antibody HGF is competing
It strives and is represented as IC 50 (concentration for reaching 50% competition) and I MAX (the maximum contention percentage reached when saturation). 
 
 
 
 As general rule, SEMA bonding agent ratio PSI bonding agent more effectively replaces HGF.Particularly, SEMA β spiral shell is identified
Revolve those of the epitope antibody in the blade 4 and 5 of paddle be most effective HGF competitor (71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,
71G2).The observation result contains with SEMA blade 5 to the identical of views of the high affinity combined sites of the α chain of HGF
(Merchant et al., National Academy of Sciences proceeding, 110 phases, E2987-2996 pages, 2013 (Merchant et al.,
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110, E2987-2996,2013)).The domain PSI not yet show directly participation HGF, but by
It is recommended that playing the role of adjusting " hinge " (Basilico et al., clinical investigation of HGF adaptability between the area SEMA Yu He IPT
Magazine, 124 phases, 3172-3186 pages, 2014 (Basilico et al., J Clin Invest.124,3172-3186,
2014)).It therefore, may be by interfering the process or passing through space with PSI (76H10,71G3,76G7,71G12) mAb combined
Steric hindrance, rather than by the direct competitive with ligand, to hinder the combination of HGF and MET.Finally, it was demonstrated that SEMA β propeller
The low-affinity of the blade 1-3 β chain of being responsible for HGF combine, play the role of a nucleus, but only partially facilitate in MET activation
HGF-MET bond strength (Stamos et al., EMBO magazine, 23 phases, 2325-2335 pages, 2004 (Stamos et al.,
EMBO J.23,2325-2335,2004)).This can explain why that the mAb (74C8,72F8) in the area in conjunction with MET is the portion of HGF
Divide competitor. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 6:MET activation detection 
 
 It is living for the expressible receptor agonism out of immunoglobulin of receptor tyrosine kinase due to their divalent property
Property, to simulate the effect of native ligand.In order to be studied along this line, we test the anti-MET of people/mouse equivalence

Immunoblotting is analyzed.Should analysis shows that, owner/mouse equivalence antibody shows MET agonist activity.Such as figure
Shown in 4, some antibody promote MET autophosphorylations degree and HGF quite (71G3,71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,71G2,
74C8).Some other antibody (76H10,76G7,71G12,72F8) effects are poor, and this is special under lower antibody concentration
It is unobvious.The clear correlation between MET activating activities and HGF competition activity is not observed. 
 In order to obtain more quantitative datas, the agonist activity of antibody is also characterized by phosphorylation-MAT ELISA.For
This, carries out serum starvation to A549 and MLP29 cell as described above, is then stimulated with the mAb of progressive concentration (0-25nM).
Use recombined human (A549) or mouse (MLP29) HGF as control.As described above (Basilico et al., clinical investigation magazine,
124 phases, 3172-3186 pages, 2014 (Basilico et al., J Clin Invest.124,3172-3186,2014)),
Lytic cell and passes through ELISA to measure phosphorylation-MET horizontal.In brief, resisted with mouse anti human MET antibody or rat small

 Embodiment 7: decentralized detection 
 
 In order to which whether the agonist activity of the anti-MET antibody of appraiser/mouse equivalence can be converted to bioactivity, we are to people
Decentralized detection has been carried out with mouse epithelial cells.For this purpose, with recombination HGF (people or the mouse of progressive concentration；It is all from R&D
Systems HPAF-II human pancreatic cancer cell (American Type Culture collection warehousing) and MLP29 mouse liver precursor) are stimulated, and
Measured after 24 hours by foregoing microexamination cell dispersion (Basilico et al., clinical investigation magazine,
124 phases, 3172-3186 pages, 2014 (Basilico et al., J Clin Invest.124,3172-3186,2014)).
The preliminary analysis discloses: HGF induction cell dispersion be it is linear, until it reaches about 0.1nM's in two kinds of cell lines
Saturation degree.Based on these HGF standard curves, we are illustrated from 0 (there is no absolutely not cells in the case where HGF
Dispersion) to 4 (maximum cell dispersion in the presence of 0.1nM HGF) points-scoring system.With people/mouse equivalence of progressive concentration
Anti- MET antibody stimulates HPAF-II and MLP29 cell, and is dispersed after 24 hours using above-mentioned points-scoring system measurement cell.Such as table
Shown in 15, which is disclosed: the mAb of all tests promote with the cell dispersion in mouse cell system, two kinds of species
As a result it is substantially overlapped.71D6 and 71G2 is shown and the identical activity of HGF；The effect of 71G3 and 71A3 is slightly below HGF；
71C3 and 74C8 needs significant higher concentration to match the activity of HGF；In the detection, 71D4,76G7,71G12 and 72F8
Not up to it is saturated.

 Embodiment 8: drug-induced Apoptosis is protected 
 
 The experimental evidence of several series shows: the anti-apoptotic that HGF goes out strength to the cells show of expression MET acts on
(by Nakamura et al., gastroenterology and hepatology magazine, 26 phases increase 1,188-202 pages, (Nakamura et in 2011
Al., J Gastroenterol Hepatol.26 Suppl 1,188-202,2011) summary).In order to which tester/mouse is of equal value
Anti- MET antibody potential anti-apoptotic activities, We conducted the drug-induced survival detections based on cell.By MCF10A people
The star spore bacterium of galactophore epithelial cell (American type culture collection) and MLP29 mouse liver precursor and progressive concentration
Plain (Sigma Aldrich) is incubated with.After 48 hrs, by using CellTiter Glo kit (Promega) and
Victor X4 multiple labeling plate reader (Perkin Elmer) measures total ATP concentration to measure cell viability.The preliminary analysis is taken off
Show: the drug concentration of about 50% cell death of induction is 60nM for MCF10A cell, and is 100nM for MLP29 cell.
Next, anti-MET mAb or recombination HGF (people or the mouse of our increasing concentration (0-32nM)；It is all from R&D Systems)
In the presence of MCF10A cell and MLP29 cell and the drug concentration of above-mentioned determination are incubated with.As described above, after 48 hrs
Measure cell viability.The analysis that is there is provided in table 16 the result shows that: people/mouse equivalence antibody protect to a great extent people and
The cell death that mouse cell is induced from staurosporin.Although some monoclonal antibodies (71G3,71D6,71G2) show
Protection activity similar or higher to HGF, but other molecules (76H10,71C3,71D4,71A3,76G7,71G12,74C8,
72F8) show in people or only in mouse cell system part protective effect.

Percentage is measured, and is represented as EC 50 And E MAX 。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 9: branching form detects 
 
 As background technology part is discussed, HGF is a kind of pleiotrophic cytokine, promotes the movable harmonic wave of independent biochemical
It adjusts, including cell Proliferation, movement, invasion, differentiation and survival.Preferably summarize all these active detections based on cell
That branching form detects, replicated in embryogenesis pipe and body of gland formation (Ros á rio and
Birchmeier, cell biology trend, 13 phases, 328-335 pages, 2003 (Ros á rio and Birchmeier,
Trends Cell Biol.13,328-335,2003) summarized).In the detection, the orbicule of epithelial cell is seeded in
It stimulates in 3D collagen stroma and by HGF to grow tubule, ultimately forms branching structure.These branching tubules are similar to
The hollow structure of epithelial gland, such as mammary gland, they show the lumen for being polarized cell encirclement.The detection is to carry out in vitro
Most complete HGF detection. 
 In order to which whether the anti-MET antibody of tester/mouse equivalence shows agonist activity in the detection, we are by LOC people
Renal epithelial cell (Michieli et al., Nature Biotechnol, 20 phases, 488-495 pages, 2002 (Michieli et al.,
Nat Biotechnol.20,488-495,2002)) and MLP29 mouse liver precursor be inoculated in collagen layer as mentioned
(Hultberg et al., cancer research, 75 phases, 3373-3383 pages, 2015 (Hultberg et al., Cancer Res.75,
3373-3383,2015)), they are then exposed to the mAb or recombination HGF of progressive concentration (people or mouse, is all from R&D
Systems).Occurred over time by micro- sem observation branching form, and taken pictures after 5 days to bacterium colony.
Representative image is shown in Fig. 5.Determining for branching morphogenic activity is obtained by counting the branch quantity of each orbicule
Amount.As shown in table 17, the dose dependent of the antibody induction of all tests branching tubule is formed.However, with MET from phosphoric acid
Change detection is consistent with the data obtained in cell decentralized detection, and 71D6,71A3 and 71G2 show most potent agonist activity, class
It is similar to or better than recombination HGF. 
 Table 17: branching form detects.By LOC people's renal epithelial cell or the cell of MLP29 mouse liver precursor

 Embodiment 10: the anti-MET antibody of people-mouse equivalence excitability, which provides, adjusts the active abundant chance of MET 
 
 Based on the biochemistry and Biological Detection described so far, We conducted the synthesis point for being intended to compare antibody function
Analysis.The property of the various mAb measured in the measurement carried out is summarised in table 18.By analyzing table discovery, people-mouse etc.
The anti-MET antibody of the excitability of valence shows extensive biochemical and bioactivity, adjusts MET activity in custom manner to provide
Abundant chance.According to selected translation or clinical application, what antibody may be selected to be competed completely or partially from identified with HGF
Those, strongly or mildly cause MET activation, strong or promote cell invasion or strong or gently short of money weekly
Anti-apoptotic.From this view point, agonistic antibody is more general compared with HGF and more plasticity because they allow with
HGF's opens or closes property compared to the more gradual changes responses of induction. 
 From the point of view of pharmacological point, it is highly useful to cause a possibility that selectivity organism is active in the downstream MET.For example, swollen
Certain applications in tumor field are beneficial to ligand, and the nutritive peculiarity of HGF is made to promote to invade (pro-invasive) activity with it
Dissociation (Michieli et al., Nature Biotechnol, 20 phases, 488-495 pages, (Michieli et al., Nat in 2002
Biotechnol.20,488-495,2002)).The other application in hepatopathy field ideally needs do not promoting cell invasion
In the case of protection liver cell from apoptosis the factor (Takahara et al., hepatopathy, 47 phases, 2010-2025 pages, 2008
(Takahara et al., Hepatology, 47,2010-2025,2008)).In the other application in muscular dystrophy field,
On the one hand myoblast differentiation sarcoblast needs to close the proliferation of HGF induction, on the other hand need to protect differentiation relevant thin
Born of the same parents' apoptosis (Cassano et al., PLoS One, 3 phases, the e3223 phase, 2008 (Cassano et al., PLoS One 3,
E3223,2008)).In all these applications and other similar situation, people be can be envisaged using partial agonistic property mAb, one
Aspect replacement endogenous HGF and on the other hand slight MET is caused to activate, to enhance certain bioactivity of HGF and simultaneously
Reduce other biological activities. 
 On the contrary, the various applications in regenerative medicine field need strength rush survival-signal and quick tissue repair, with
Prevent irreversible cellular damage or denaturation.For example, being issued in the case where unexpected hepatic failure, acute kidney injury or severe pancreatitis
(by Nakamura et al., gastroenterology and hepatology magazine, 26 phases increase 1,188-202 pages to existing such case, and institute is comprehensive within 2011
State (Nakamura et al., J Gastroenterol Hepatol.26 Suppl 1,188-202,2011)).It is all this
In a little applications and other similar situation, people would rather use complete excitability mAb, push as efficiently as possible organization healing and
Regeneration.HGF competition is not worked really in this case, because excitability mAb is effective as HGF (if not completely
It is more effective), and can reach the pharmacology log concentration for being higher than the physiological level of discovery endogenous ligands. 
 The non-standard that other are related to HGF, less in the pathologic condition of function that characterizes, be such as such as related to siberian crabapple
System (inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, transplanting related complication), hemopoietic system (stem cell mobilization, hematopoiesis) and nervous system
In those of (nerve growth, neuronal degeneration) pathologic condition, the effect of HGF/MET approach is still seldom studied.Although several
The experimental evidence of series shows recombination HGF or HGF gene therapy improves these diseases (by Nakamura in preclinical models
Et al., gastroenterology and hepatology magazine, 26 phases increase 1,188-202 pages, summarize within 2011 (Nakamura et al., J
Gastroenterol Hepatol.26 Suppl 1,188-202,2011)), we do not have enough information to determine HGF's
Institute is functional or only whether partial function is beneficial.For these treatment uses, compared with HGF, with the MET excitement of high diversity
It is potential advantageous (the Summary institute without mentioning such as invention that property antibody group, which fine-tunes a possibility that MET is active,
Discussion uses recombination HGF as the numerous pharmacological problems implied in drug). 
 In short, it is proposed that the anti-MET antibody of the people of all identifications-mouse equivalence may have potential work to treatment use
With no matter itself and HGF are perfect competition or partial competition, and no matter its activation MET receptor or part completely activates MET
Receptor. 
 Table 18: the main biochemical and biological characteristic of the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence.The table summarize every kind of mAb with
Lower ability: in conjunction with the MET ECD of purifying ability (ELISA), identification MET expression cell on natural MET ability (FACS),
With HGF competition MET combine ability (HGF competition), receptor autophosphorylation detection in activation MET ability (MET activation), rush
The ability (decentralized detection) dispersed into cell, the ability (survival detection) for protecting cells from drug-induced Apoptosis, and
Promote the morphogenetic ability of branching (generation of branching form) of epithelial cell orbicule.Every kind is detected, the scoring
Based on any given mAb relative to other antibody relative activity (+, lower limit 50%；++, the upper limit 50%).Due to all anti-
Body shows similar activity in people and mouse system, therefore each detection only shows a score. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 11: constant region exchanges the biochemistry and biological characteristic for not changing people/mouse equivalence antibody 
 
 Since the purpose of the present invention is generate and identify the excitability of equal value to work well in people and mouse system
Anti- MET antibody, it is intended to determine whether people's heavy chain and constant region of light chain influence to represent with the exchange of corresponding murine constant region
The main biochemical and bioactivity of property antibody group.For this purpose, we select 3 kinds of representativenesses from people/mouse equivalence antibody group
Molecule (the partial agonist in the partial competition agent of 71G3, HGF and biological detection；The perfect competition agent of 71D6 and 71G2, HGF
With the full agonist in biological detection).The area VH and VL of 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 are mounted on 1/ λ antibody backbone of mouse IgG
On.The sequence of all mouse immune globulin variants is available from public database, such as ImMunoGeneTics information system
(www.imgt.org).It can be realized by standard gene engineering process and be merged with desired variable region.The llama-of generation is small
The heavy chain of mouse chimeric antibody and the complete amino acid sequence of light chain are shown in Table 19. 
 Table 19: in conjunction with the llama of people and mouse MET-mouse chimera mAb entire heavy chain and light-chain amino acid sequence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The generation and purifying of recombination immunoglobulin can by according to the scheme well established respectively in mammalian cell
In transiently transfect and affinity chromatography obtains.Hereafter, we are by the biochemistry of 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 of murine forms and life
The biochemistry and bioactivity of the same antibody of object activity and person form compare. 
 We evaluate ability of the antibody with the people of purifying or mouse MET ECD ining conjunction with by ELISA, by FACS evaluation knowledge
The ability of the dispersion of the ability of others or the natural MET on mouse cell, induction people and mouse epithelial cells, and promote collagen
In the morphogenetic ability of branching.The analysis summarized in table 20 the result shows that, people exchanges substantially with murine constant region
Do not influence any property analyzed. 
 Table 20: constant region exchanges the biochemistry and biological characteristic that will not change people/mouse equivalence antibody.To mouse or humanoid
The representative agonistic antibody (71G3,71D6 and 71G2) of three kinds of formula carries out several main biochemicals and biology for being intended to characterize them

 Because the animal model of most human diseases uses mouse as host, the cross reactivity with murine antigen is
The necessary antecedent of antibody, bioactivity needs are verified in preclinical system.All due to the prior art resist
Body be all generated in mouse (in addition to user's naivety phage library identification B7 other than), these molecules be less likely with it is small
Cross reaction occurs for mouse MET.Even if be in the small cross reaction principle of autoantigen it is possible, these interactions are also led to
Often with there is low-down affinity. 
 As being described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,099,841,3D6 antibody does not combine mouse MET, and inventor must make
Prove that their antibody has activity in vivo with ferret and mink.It is obvious that these animal models are neither represented for simulating
The idealized system of human disease, their purposes in preclinical medicine are not also established.In addition, the inventor does not provide and people system
System and the affinity of antibody between ferret or mink system and the related any quantitative data of activity difference. 
 It is explicitly shown out 5D5 antibody and its derivative and does not combine mouse MET (Merchant et al., National Academy of Sciences
Proceeding, 110 phases, E2987-2996 pages, 2013 (Merchant et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110,
E2987-2996,2013)).The not information about itself and the cross reactivity of other preclinical species. 
 Equally, U.S. Patent Application No. 201,4/0,193,431 A1 without provide about B7 antibody and mouse MET or other
The information of the cross reactivity of species MET. 
 7,556,804 B2 bugle call of U.S. Patent No. claims NO-23 antibody and mouse, rat and dog MET cross reaction, but does not have
Quantitative experiment evidence is provided with to support the statement.The inventor uses the NO-23 of single saturated dose from mouse, rat, people
Or immunoprecipitation MET in the lysate of dog cell, then by the protein of immunoprecipitation and radioactivity 32 P-ATP is incubated with.?
After radioactive label, incorporation is made by autoradiograph 32 P-ATP visualization.This method is very sensitive and is definitely not
Quantitative；Can not can know that the percentage with corresponding cross reactivity on gel is how many. 
 Similarly, it is proposed that DO-24 antibody and mouse MET cross reaction, because the matrigel particle containing DO-24 is being implanted into
When mouse peritoneal promote vascular recruitment (Prat et al., cell science journal, 111 phases, 237-247 pages, (Prat et in 1998
Al., J Cell Sci.111,237-247,1998)).However, this is also likely to be since inflammation increases and no offer DO-24
With the positive evidence of mouse MET interaction.In another different research, the DO-24 of single saturated dose is shown
(20nM) causes autophosphorylation (Pietronave etc. of MET in rat myocardial cell system H9c2 and mouse cardiac myocytes system HL-5
People, American Physiological magazine-heart and physiology of circulation, 298 phases, H1155-65 pages, 2010 (Pietronave et al.,
Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol.298, H1155-65,2010；Fig. 1)).In identical experiment, show low
The recombination HGF (0.5nM) of dosage much causes MET phosphorylation to comparable degree.As author oneself is in discussing part
Recognized, these are the result shows that effect of the DO-24 in these rodent cells systems is significantly lower than HGF.Due to same work
Person claims that DO-24 is and HGF activity matched complete excitability mAb (Prat et al., the cell science in people's cell model
Report, 111 phases, 237-247 pages, 1998 (Prat et al., J Cell Sci.111,237-247,1998)), therefore should
Show that DO-24 does not cause the conclusion of identical effect or effect in people and mouse cell.It should further be noted that:
Testing shown in Pietronave et al. not is quantitative and cannot be used for sending out between extraction DO-24 and mouse or rat MET
The information of raw cross reaction degree, measurement need the head to head dose response completed such as us research (to see below
Text).In Section 3 work, it is immunized from mouse mesenchymal cell lysate using the mixture of DO-24 and DN-30 antibody
Precipitating MET (Forte et al., stem cell, 24 phases, 23-33 pages, (Forte et al., Stem Cells.24,23- in 2006
33,2006)).The presence of DN-30 and detection type (immunoprecipitation from cell pyrolysis liquid) all prevent obtain about DO-24 with
The precise information of the ability of native mouse MET interaction.In short, without any experimental evidence prove DO-24 antibody in people and
Cause comparable biological response in mouse cell. 
 Finally, be explicitly shown out DN-30 antibody not with mouse MET interaction (Prat et al., cell science journal, 111
Phase, 237-247 pages, 1998 (Prat et al., J Cell Sci.111,237-247,1998)；With Petrelli et al.,
National Academy of Sciences proceeding, 103 phases, 5090-9095 pages, (Petrelli et al., Proc Natl Acad in 2006
Sci USA 103,5090-9095,2006) supplementary material). 
 Whether the anti-MET antibody of excitability in order to directly determine the prior art is with mouse MET cross reaction and with which kind of
Degree and mouse MET cross reaction, and in order to be compared them with our anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence, I
Carried out ELISA detection.Since the antibody of all prior arts is obtained or is engineered in the form of mouse IgG/λ, I
Using 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 mouse IgG/λ form.By people or mouse MET ECD be fixed on solid phase (hole 100ng/, 96
Orifice plate) in, and it is exposed to the antibody of progressive concentration in solution (0-40nM).It is anti-in conjunction with the anti-mouse Fc being conjugated by using HRP
Body (Jackson Immuno Res Lab (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories)) is disclosed.Such as table
Shown in 21, which is disclosed；Although the antibody of the prior art is with the K of 0.059nM (B7) to 4.935nM (3D6) d With people MET
In conjunction with, but they do not show any affinity to mouse MET under the up to concentration of 40nM yet.In the anti-of test
In body, only 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 is in conjunction with people and mouse MET, and they have the affinity being difficult to differentiate between and capacity.
The complete binding curve of all antibody is as shown in Figure 6. 
 Table 21: pass through the binding affinity and capacity of the anti-MET antibody of the people and mouse MET of ELISA measurement.Affinity with
EC 50 (nMol/L) it indicates.Capacity is with E MAX (the optical density at 450nm；N.c., not converged) it indicates.For entire binding curve,
Refer to Fig. 6. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 13: compared with the antibody of the prior art: MET autophosphorylation 
 
 In order to compare the prior art antibody agonist activity and people/mouse anti-MET antibody of equal value agonist activity, we
User and mouse cell carry out the experiment of MET autophosphorylation.To A549 human lung carcinoma cell and MLP29 mouse liver precursor into
Row deprives Serum Growth-Factors 48 hours, is then stimulated with the antibody of progressive concentration (0-25nM).After stimulation 15 minutes,
Cell is washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (PBS), then carries out cracking (Longati et al., the cancer base
Cause, 9 phases, 49-57 pages, 1994 (Longati et al., Oncogene 9,49-57,1994)).As described above
(Basilico et al., clinical investigation magazine, 124 phases, 3172-3186 pages, (Basilico et al., J Clin in 2014
Invest.124,3172-3186,2014)), by the anti-MET antibody (R&D Systems) for capture and for announcement
The ELISA of anti phosphotyrosine (R&D Systems) is horizontal to measure phosphorylation-MET. 
 The analysis discloses: between people described in the antibody and this document of the prior art/mouse anti-MET antibody of equal value
Two main differences.Firstly, consistent with the result obtained in Binding experiment, only 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 can promote people and mouse
MET autophosphorylation in cell.The antibody (including DO-24 and NO-23) of the prior art only induces MET activation in people's cell；
And the activity to mouse cell is not detected in the system that we analyze.Secondly, compared with 71G3,71D6 and 71G2, institute
There is the antibody of the prior art always to show lower agonist activity.The prior art mAb of most excitability is 5D5 and B7,
Show the activity of slightly below 71G3,71D6 and 71G2.The prior art mAb of least excitability is 3D6.Other molecule displays
Intermediate active out.The result of the analysis is shown in Figure 7. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 14: compared with the antibody of the prior art: branching form occurs 
 
 In order to compare the prior art antibody bioactivity and the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence bioactivity, I
Carried out branching form and detected.The detection summarises all relevant biological activities of HGF, including cell Proliferation, point
It dissipates, break up and survives.As described above, LOC people's renal epithelial cell and MLP29 mouse liver precursor are inoculated in collagen layer, so
It is incubated with afterwards with the mAb of progressive concentration or recombination HGF (people or mouse are all from R&D Systems).Over time
Occurred by micro- sem observation branching form, and taken pictures after 5 days to bacterium colony.Quantifying for branching morphogenic activity passes through
The quantity of the branch tubule to germinate from each orbicule is counted to realize, and is shown in table 22.The representativeness of orbicule
Image is shown in Fig. 8 (LOC cell) and Fig. 9 (MLP29 cell). 
 Table 22: branching form detects.By LOC people's renal epithelial cell or the cell of MLP29 mouse liver precursor
Spherical body preparation is inoculated in collagen layer, then with the mAb or recombined human HGF (LOC) of progressive concentration (0,0.04,0.2,1 and 5nM)
Or mouse HGF (MLP29) is incubated with.Occurred over time by micro- sem observation branching form, and after 5 days
It takes pictures to bacterium colony.Quantify branch by calculating the branch quantity of each orbicule (major branches add secondary branch).

 Shown in data lead to following observation result.In people's cell, 71D6,71G2 and 5D5 show suitable with people HGF
Activity；71G3,3D6, B7 and DO-24 show as partial agonist；NO-23 and DN-30 shows considerably less agonist activity.
In mouse cell, only 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 formation for effectively inducing branching tubule；Every other antibody, with them
Cannot be consistent in conjunction with mouse MET in ELISA, not induction branching form occurs. 
 We conclude that: compared with people/mouse anti-MET antibody of equal value, the antibody of the prior art is in people and mouse system
It is middle to cause different bioactivity. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 15: the plasma half-life of the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence 
 
 Next, the selected anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence is transferred in In vivo study by we.As preliminary analysis,
We determined that their peaks and trough level in mouse.For this purpose, we by intraperitoneal injection by the 71G3 of affinity purification,
71D6 and 71G2 (in the form of its mouse IgG/λ) are injected into 7 week old female BAl BIcs/c mouse (Charles River).Injection
The single bolus of 1mg/kg or 10mg/kg, and after injection blood sample is acquired from tail vein within 3,6,12 and 24 hours.To blood
Liquid sample carries out processing and measures the antibody concentration in blood plasma by ELISA.As described in example 1 above, employment METECD
(hole 100ng/) is coated with 96 orifice plate of standard, is then exposed to be incremented by diluted mice plasma to capture anti-MET antibody.With PBS
After washing repeatedly, depositing for anti-MET antibody is disclosed using the donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories) of HRP conjugation
?.For the antibody of quantitative combination, we establish the standard curve of 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 of purifying under the same conditions. 
 The result of the analysis is shown in Figure 10.Antibody concentration in blood plasma is similar for the antibody of all tests, and
And it is directly proportional to the amount of the protein of injection.After 24 hours, it is about 15nM that the antibody concentration in blood plasma, which injects 1mg/kg,
And 10mg/kg is injected as 250nM.In view of these antibody are in most harsh detection (branching form detects)
Agonist activity reach saturation at 5nM or lower concentration, we can safely conclude that by intraperitoneal injection obtain
The blood plasma level of antibody is related to down to injecting for 1mg/kg from the point of view of biological point. 
 In addition, we also calculate the plasma half-life of injection of antibodies.This is by the way that antibody concentration is converted to nature pair
Data are fitted slope that is into a line and then calculating line to realize by number (Ln).The analysis cause estimate 71G3,71D6 and
The half-life period of 71G2 is closely similar, and it is about 9 days that 1mg/kg, which is injected corresponding about 3 days and 10mg/kg is injected,.This
Be with reported its in rodent with 2.4 minutes half-life period recombination HGF (Ido et al., hepatopathy are studied, 30 phases,
175-181 pages, 2004 (Ido et al., Hepatol Res.30,175-181,2004)) compared to significant higher stabilization
Property.The plasma stability Data Summary of whole group is in table 23. 
 These statistics indicate that: in all clinical applications for needing Formulations for systemic administration HGF, the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence can
Advantageously instead of recombinating HGF. 
 Table 23: people/mouse equivalent antibodies plasma stability.By intraperitoneal injection by 71G3,71D6 of affinity purification and
The single bolus (1mg/kg or 10mg/kg) of 71G2 is administered to 7 week old female BAl BIcs/c mouse.In injection 3,6,12 and 24 hours
Afterwards, blood sample is acquired from tail vein, and the antibody concentration in blood plasma is measured by ELISA.Pass through linear fit antibody concentration
Natural logrithm convert to calculate plasma half-life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 16: activity in vivo: protection acute liver damage 
 
 Liver cell expression MET and be HGF major target, HGF promotes them to be proliferated and protects them against cell to wither
Die (by Nakamura et al., gastroenterology and hepatology magazine, 188-202 pages, summary (Nakamura et in 2011
Al., J Gastroenterol Hepatol.1,188-202,2011)).Therefore, we test the excitement of people/mouse equivalence
Whether the anti-MET antibody of property in the mouse model of acute hepatic failure shows protection activity.For this purpose, we are by the CCl of single dose 4 
(10% solution in the olive oil of 0.2ml；It is all from Sigma-Aldrich) it is injected into 7 week old female BAl BIcs/c mouse
In the subcutaneous compartment of (Charles River).In CCl 4 After injection soon, mouse is randomly divided into 4 big groups, it is 6 small per big group
Mouse, every mouse receive 71G3,71D6,71G2 for purifying or the only single bolus of carrier (PBS).Antibody passes through intraperitoneal injection agent
Amount is administered for 5mg/kg.(0,12,24 and 48 hour) acquisition blood sample of different time after injection.In addition the 5th
The big group of control includes 6 mouse, does not receive CCl 4 Or it antibody and is condemned to death at the end of experiment.In postmortem, blood is collected
Liquid and liver are analyzed.Liver marker aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin
(BIL) blood plasma level is measured by standard clinical biochemical method.Liver is embedded in paraffin and uses standard scheme
Processing is carried out to it for histologic analysis. 
 As shown in figure 11, the CCl in control mice 4 Injection causes the fast of the level for all three blood parameters analyzed
Speed and significant increase, this increase reach peak value after poisoning 12-24 hours.In big group of control, CCl 4 Injection causes
AST, ALT and bilirubin level increase 286,761 and 13 times respectively.In big group of all antibody, these, which increase, is significantly reduced
(71G3,53%, 62% and 46%；71D6,37%, 34% and 48%；71G2,50%, 39% and 54%).With regard to liver protecting
Speech, most effective antibody is 71D6. 
 In postmortem, the histological examination of liver is disclosed: CCl4 causes to show around the central vein of each liver module
The tissue damage of work, it is characterised in that acidophilia dyeing and big cytoplasm are typically diseased liver cells.Cell-ECM is mutual
Effect seems loose, to allow to infiltrate the red blood cell oozed out from damaged blood vessels.In big group of antibody processing, these centers
Surrounding damaged zone is smaller and shows less tolerance sign, this can pass through the dyeing of less acidophilia, normal cell
Matter size and the infiltration of reduced haemocyte are to prove.The presentation graphics of the liver section dyed with h and E are shown in figure
12。 
 These the result shows that: the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can be used for clinic to treat acute hepatic disease
Disease, acute hepatic disease are characterized in that hepatosis is quickly grown, and typically result in liver biochemistry value exception, jaundice, blood coagulation
Dysfunction, brain edema and encephalopathy.These pathological conditions include but is not limited to: paracetamol is excessive, to drug (such as four
Ring element) specific reaction, drug abuse (head-shaking pill, cocaine), virus infection (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, penta type liver
It is scorching). 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 17: activity in vivo: protection chronic liver injury 
 
 We be also tested for the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability whether in the mouse model of chronic liver injury table
Reveal therapeutic effect.In fact, known HGF has anti-fibrosis activity (by Matsumoto and Nakamura, vapour in liver
Bar foundation seminar, 212 phases, 198-211 pages；211-214 pages of discussion, 1997 (Matsumoto and Nakamura,
Ciba Found Symp.212,198-211；Discussion 211-214,1997) summarized).For this purpose, by 7 week old female
BALB/c mouse (Charles River) is exposed to CCl for a long time 4 Several weeks.First week, with the CCl of 0.1ml 4 In olive oil
Mouse is subcutaneously injected twice in 5% solution (being all from Sigma-Aldrich).Next a few weeks, CCl 4 Dosage increase
(10% solution of the 0.1ml in olive oil), while frequency of injection remains unchanged (twice a week).After first time injects not
Long, mouse is randomly divided into 4 big groups, per 7 mouse of group greatly, receives 71G3,71D6,71G2 for using purifying respectively or only carrier
(PBS) processing carried out.Antibody is administered by intraperitoneal injection dosage three-times-weekly for 1mg/kg.In addition the 5th control is big
Group includes 7 mouse, does not receive CCl 4 Or antibody and be used as normal healthy controls.In chronic CCl 4 Mouse is put to death after being poisoned 6 weeks.
In postmortem, collects blood and liver is analyzed.Liver marker aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) blood plasma level is measured by standard clinical biochemical method.Liver is embedded in paraffin and uses standard scheme
Processing is carried out to it for histologic analysis. 
 As shown in figure 13, it has been determined that control mice is exposed to CCl for a long time by higher AST and ALT blood plasma level 4 It leads
Cause liver function damage.With cause liver landmarks object level sharply but the acute model of of short duration outburst is on the contrary, chronic CCl 4 Poisoning lures
The milder for leading AST and ALT level increases, and is about 5 times compared with not treating mouse.It is worth noting that, Antybody therapy can be complete
The full increase for preventing AST concentration, is actually decreased below foundation level.Antibody can also significantly prevent the quick-fried of ALT level
Hair, although surprising unlike as being observed for AST. 
 By the various technologies (including the Masson trichrome stain, Picro Picro-Sirius red and anti-that are intended to detect fibrosed tissue
α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody) liver section is dyed.Carry out h and E dyeing also to check one
As histological structure.The analysis discloses: chronic CCl 4 Processing leads to the fibrosis group for forming significant quantity in space between leaflet
It knits, especially it is characterized in that Picro Picro-Sirius red and anti alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody stained positive.It is fine
Dimensionization organizes the formation of a kind of " ribbon " for connecting portal vein triplet, to prove the hexagonal shape of liver unit.It is worth
It is noted that receiving CCl 4 It is shown in terms of staining power more with the liver section of the animal origin of the anti-MET antibody of excitability
Slight fibrosis, and fiberizing zone seems to be confined to portal vein surrounding space.It is anti-with Picro Picro-Sirius red and anti alpha-SMA
The presentation graphics of the liver section of body dyeing are shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15. 
 These statistics indicate that, the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can be used for clinical to treat and chronic liver injury
Relevant pathological condition, it is characterised in that hepatic parenchymal progressive destroys and regenerate and cause cirrhosis and fibrosis.Excitement
The anti-MET antibody of property can be used for reducing or preventing fibrosis, to make liver structure and functional rehabilitation.They can also be used to inhibit scorching
Disease and immune response, to usually aggravate chronic liver disease. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 18: activity in vivo: protection acute kidney injury 
 
 Renal epithelial cell express the level of signifiance MET and to HGF stimulation it is very sensitive (by Mizuno et al., preceding biology
Science, 13 phases, 7072-7086 pages, institute is comprehensive within 2008 (Mizuno et al.Front Biosci.13,7072-7086,2008)
It states).Therefore, we test the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability whether in the mouse model of acute renal failure table
Reveal protective effect.For this purpose, we pass through the HgCl of intraperitoneal injection single bolus 2 (3mg/kg) come induce 7 week old female BAl BIcs/
The renal damage of c mouse (Charles River).In HgCl 2 After poisoning soon, mouse is randomly divided into 4 big group, warp
Benefit from 71G3,71D6,71G2 or the only processing of carrier (PBS) progress.The abdominal cavity that antibody is 10mg/kg by every 24 hours dosage
Injection is administered.Each big group includes 6 mouse, in injection HgCl 2 It is condemned to death after 72 hours.In postmortem, blood is collected
Liquid and kidney are analyzed.Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and kreatinin (CRE) blood plasma level are surveyed by standard clinical biochemical method
It is fixed.Histologic analysis is used for using standard scheme processing kidney. 
 As shown in figure 16, HgCl 2 It is injected into and causes sharply increasing for BUN and CRE level in control mice.In big group of control
In, BUN and CRE have increased separately 6 times and 12 times.In big group of all antibody, these increase significantly reduce (be respectively as follows: 71G3,
52% and 54%；71D6,39% and 30%；71G2,45% and 44%).For protection renal, most effective antibody is
71D6。 
 The histological examination of kidney discloses: HgCl 2 Cause extensive renal damage, it is characterised in that proximal tubule expands
, atrophy and necrosis.It glomerulus structural collapse and is detached from from surrounding substrate, to substantially increase empty around glomerulus
Between.In big group of antibody processing, promixal tubular cell necrosis is less, and the histological structure of glomerulus seems complete.
The presentation graphics of the Kidney sections dyed with h and E are shown in Figure 17. 
 It is proposed that: the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can be used for clinical related to acute renal failure to treat
Pathological condition, may be by such as ischemic or Nephrotoxicity, hypovolemic shock, urine collection system obstruction,
Caused by atherosclerosis, septicemia, diabetes, autoimmune disease or rhabdomyolysis.The anti-MET antibody of excitability
It can be used for preventing or reversing acute renal failure, protection renal cells accelerate re-epithelilization simultaneously from Apoptosis
And restore renal function. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 19: activity in vivo: acute colonic damage is protected in the mouse model of ulcerative colitis, reduces inflammation 
 It is regenerated with promotion 
 
 It is well known that enterocyte expresses MET, and HGF plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of gastrointestinal tract and regeneration
(Nakamura et al., gastroenterology and hepatology magazine, 188-202 pages, (Nakamura et al., J in 2011
Gastroenterol Hepatol.1,188-202,2011)).Therefore, it is anti-to test people/mouse equivalence excitability for we
Whether MET antibody can promote intestines to protect and regenerate in the mouse model of ulcerative colitis.For this purpose, we are female by 7 week old
BALB/c mouse (Charles River) is exposed to the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water 10 days.At the 10th day, interrupt
DSS is treated and is put back to mouse in normal water.Since the 1st day, mouse is randomly divided into 7 big group, each big group is 7 small
Mouse receives with 71G3,71D6,71G2 (dosage for 1mg/kg or 5mg/kg) or processing that only carrier (PBS) carries out.Antibody passes through
Intraperitoneal injection is administered three-times-weekly.In addition the big group of the 8th control includes 7 mouse, do not receive DSS or antibody and
As normal healthy controls.At the 12nd day, that is, 2 days after interrupting DSS administration, put to death mouse.In postmortem, colon is collected,
It cleans, and measures their length with ruler.After a measurement, colon is embedded in paraffin and it is handled, be used for group
Knit credit analysis. 
 In the entire experiment process, periodic monitoring mouse weight, and it is thick by measurement fecal blood, hemoproctia and excrement
It spends to assess the clinical symptoms of ulcerative colitis.By using the standard scoring system (Kim used in preclinical models
People, visualized experiment magazine, 60 phases, pii:3678 pages, 2012 (Kim et al., J Vis Exp.60, pii:3678,
2012)) quantitative to realize: each parameter scores are from 0 (without symptom) to 3 (the maximum performances of symptom).It will be relative to single
The scoring of the parameter disease activity index (DAI) added together to generate 0 to 9. 
 As shown in figure 18, being exposed to DSS in big group of PBS causes body weight loss to be up to 25%；DAI rises to 4 points or higher；
And the length of colon reduces up to 40%.It is worth noting that, the antibody of all analyses is inverse all in a manner of dose-dependent
These effects are turned, to show significant activity under the relatively low-dose of test.71D6 is most effective antibody: short
Temporarily after decline, it is suitable that it observes weight recovery into normal value, with PBS group；It inhibits the increase of DAI, thus greatly
All clinical symptoms are inhibited greatly；And it prevents colon short and small, to be limited in inappreciable variation range. 
 Section of colon is dyed with h and E, and is checked by microscope.As shown in figure 19, DSS gives
Medicine causes seriously to damage to mucous membrane of colon.Corroding and by lymphocytic infiltration occurs in epithelial layer.Mucous membrane of colon being concealed property purulence
Swollen position is spread, and the foam macrophages for being caused disorganization are seriously colonized.There is enlargement in surrounding internal organ lymph node.It is viscous
Liquid gland is characterized in that atrophy and shows the consumption of apparent mucus, by inflammatory infiltration object (including foamy macrophage, leaching
Bar cell and neutrophil leucocyte) replace.The obviously invasion by granulocyte or macrophage exudate of several ulcer, so as to cause
Body of gland ingredient completely disappears.It is worth noting that, being shown with the mouse of DSS and the anti-MET antibody processing of excitability slighter
Denaturation and inflammatory symptom.Specifically, the ingredient of acute inflammation, including macrophage and granulocyte is not present；Mucous membrane only occurs
Slight damage shows as sparse body of gland distortion and sparse；Mucin secretion is restored, and absolutely not rotten to the corn and routed
Ulcer.Although these protective effects be all in all antibody groups it is dose-dependent, they are readily apparent that in 1mg/kg,
This shows the very close saturation of the antibody concentration reached with the dosage (referring to the plasma stability in embodiment 15).In the model
In, most effective antibody seemingly 71D6. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 20: activity in vivo: in the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease protect acute colonic damage, reduce inflammation and 
 Immunosupress 
 
 Under the promotion of the above results, whether we are also tested for the anti-MET antibody of excitability in the more special of inflammatory bowel disease
Therapeutic effect is shown in anisotropic mouse model.For this purpose, we dissolve 2,4,6- trinitro-s in ethanol by rectal injection
Benzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induction acute colonic damage in 7 week old female C57BL/6 mouse (Charles River).Known TNBS/
Ethanol composition by immune and erosion process induce colorectum inflammation (by Jones-Hall and Grisham, Pathological Physiology,
21 phases, 267-288 pages, 2014 (Jones-Hall and Grisham, Pathophysiology 21,267-288,2014)
It is summarized).The TNBS being dissolved in 50% ethyl alcohol is administered with the dosage of 5mg/ mouse by bowel lavage.After TNBS administration not
Long, mouse is randomly divided into 4 big groups, per 6 mouse of group greatly, receives 71G3,71D6,71G2 for using purifying or only carrier (PBS)
The processing of progress.Antibody every other day passes through intraperitoneal injection dosage and is administered for 1mg/kg.In addition the big group packet of the 5th control
Containing 6 mouse, does not receive TNBS or antibody and be used as normal healthy controls.Daily monitoring mouse weight.5 days after TNBS administration
Put to death mouse.As described above, collecting in postmortem and measuring colon.After a measurement, by colon be embedded in paraffin and to its into
Row processing, is used for histologic analysis. 
 As shown in figure 20, it is exposed to that TNBS results in weight loss about 15% and colon lengths reduce by more than 20%.To the greatest extent
Pipe milder compared with the effect as caused by DSS, but these effects and the significant effect observed in big group of all antibody are not
Together.In fact, the processing carried out with 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 almost inhibits the weight loss of TNBS induction and colon to contract
It is short, so that the animal for handling antibody can hardly distinguish with normal healthy controls mouse. 
 Section of colon is dyed with h and E, and is checked by microscope.As shown in figure 21, TNBS gives
Efficacy-enhancing ingredient plays the breaking-out of the classical symptom of lymphatic colitis, which is characterized in that internal organ lymph node increasing around
Greatly, the lymphocyte aggregation and lymphocytic infiltration occurred in submucosa and mucous membrane increases.Several full deep ulcers are can
See, it is related with excessive matrix proliferation and lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration.All these pathologic processes are in excitement
It is strongly inhibited during property is big group of MET antibody anti-, shows the mucosa injury of reduced lymphocytic infiltration and reduction.Even if in the presence of
Lymphocyte, they will not be damaged to mucus or epithelial damage is related. 
 It is being reported in these results and preceding embodiment statistics indicate that: the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can be used for
Clinic is to treat pathological condition relevant to ulcerative colitis or pathological condition more generally relevant with inflammatory bowel disease.With excitement
Property the processing that carries out of anti-MET antibody can reduce damage of intestines, promote epithelial cell proliferation and reduce inflammatory cell infiltration, so as to improve
The clinical process of disease. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 21: activity in vivo: promoting glucose uptake in the type-1 diabetes mellitus mouse model and cooperates with insulin 
 
 It is reported that HGF promotes insulin-dependent glucose uptake (Perdomo in the mice skeletal cell of culture
Et al., journal of biological chemistry, 283 phases, 13700-13706 pages, 2008 (Perdomo et al., J Biol Chem.283,
13700-13706,2008)).Therefore, it is small whether the anti-MET antibody of excitability that we test us can reduce type-1 diabetes mellitus
The elevated blood glucose levels of mouse model.For this purpose, we pass through intraperitoneal injection streptozotocin (STZ；Sigma Aldrich) it induces 7 weeks
The pancreas beta cell of age female BAl BIc/c mouse (Charles River) is denaturalized.STZ is injected with the dosage of daily 40mg/kg, even
It is 5 days continuous.Latter week is being injected for the last time, measures the blood glucose level under fasted conditions using standard glucose item (GIMA).
At this point, the mouse of STZ processing shows twice compared with untreated mouse of average basal blood glucose, (240mg/dL is to 120mg/
dL).Mouse is randomly divided into 4 big group, receives purifying respectively based on basal plasma glucose per 7 mouse of group, every mouse greatly
The processing that 71G3,71D6,71G2 or only carrier (PBS) carry out.Antibody by intraperitoneal injection dosage twice a week be 1mg/kg into
Row administration.In addition the big group of the 5th control includes 7 mouse, does not receive STZ or antibody and is used as normal healthy controls.It supervises at any time
The blood sugar concentration under fasted conditions is surveyed, continues 5 weeks.At the end of the 5th week, We conducted glucose tolerance test (GTT) and
Insulin tolerance tests (ITT).GTT includes that glucose is administered to fasting animals by oral administration gavage, then in different time points
Measure blood glucose level.ITT includes by intraperitoneal injection or being injected intravenously to part fasting animals administration insulin, then in difference
Point in time measurement blood glucose level. 
 As shown in fig. 22, the basal plasma glucose level of the mouse of STZ processing continues to increase during entire experiment.This be by
In chronic pancreatitis disease, organ damage is gradually aggravated.On the contrary, the animal of antibody processing shows the blood glucose water of steady decrease
Flat, the blood glucose level of the steady decrease is finally reached plateau after the second week for the treatment of.Antibody administration does not make blood glucose complete
Normalization, but the level for making which reduce up to 25%, therefore observing it in the mouse of STZ processing and control mice
Between it is approximately half of.In view of hyperglycemia is due to the insulin of shortage β cell origin in the model, we wonder anti-
Whether lower glucose level is since insulin level increases in big group of body.However, the ELISA detection to blood sample is taken off
The really not so (not shown) of situation is shown.In GTT, although receiving the mouse of Antybody therapy since lower blood glucose level,
But fail to show normal glucose uptake curve (Figure 22 B).On the contrary, the mouse of antibody processing shows in ITT really
Insulin is responded faster (Figure 22 C).After injection of insulin 15 minutes, the glucose of the mouse of chronic Antybody therapy is undergone
Blood level falls to approximately 30-40% relative to time zero, this is substantially less than in the STZ mouse handled and observes in control-animal
The level (Figure 22 D) arrived.These the result shows that: in the case where no insulin, the anti-MET antibody of excitability promotes glucose to take the photograph
It takes.They also propose: the anti-MET antibody of excitability and insulin synergic adjustment glucose uptakes in the presence of both. 
 The hypothesis is tested in the measurement based on cell using mice skeletal cell.According to the recommendation of supplier, lure
C2C12 mouse muscle-forming cell is led (obtained from US mode tissue substance collection warehousing (American Tissue Type
Collection)) break up sarcoblast, then together with the anti-MET antibody (71G3,71D6,71G2) of people/mouse equivalence excitability
It is incubated for.After 24 hours, the cell by antibody processing is divided into 3 big groups, undergoes in fluorescent glucose analog 2- (N-7- nitro-
2,1,3- benzoxadiazole -4- amino) -2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG；Life Technologies) in the presence of use
Acute irritation 1 hour of 0nM, 100nM or 1000nM biosynthetic human insulin (Sigma Aldrich) progress.2-NBDG intake is logical
Overflow-type cell art is measured. 
 As shown in figure 23,71G3,71D6 and 71G2 promote glucose uptake with dosage-dependent manner.With individual pancreas islet
Plain to compare with individual antibody, the combination of insulin and the anti-MET antibody of excitability produces synergistic effect and promotes higher
Glucose uptake.These data with culture cell in adjust glucose metabolism HGF and insulin cooperate in discovery one
Cause (Fafalios et al., Natural medicine, 17 phases, 1577-1584 pages, 2011 (Fafalios et al.Nat Med.17,
1577-1584,2011)), and confirming our hypothesis, that is, it is non-dependent that the anti-MET antibody of excitability can enhance insulin
Property and dependent glucose intake. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 22: body activity: blood glucose level normalization and insulin is overcome to support in type-2 diabetes mellitus mouse model 
 It is anti- 
 
 In the promotion for observing that the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can cooperate with promotion glucose uptake with insulin
Under, we test their treatment potentiality in type-2 diabetes mellitus mouse model.Type-2 diabetes mellitus is characterized in that hyperglycemia
Horizontal, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.The mouse model of type-2 diabetes mellitus most feature first is that db/db mouse, one
Kind has the C57BLKS/J bacterial strain of point mutation in leptin receptor gene lepr.The mutation cause satiety lose and therefore
Cause infinitely to ingest, so as to cause fat and above-mentioned type-2 diabetes mellitus clinical marker (by Wang et al., current diabetes summary,
10 phases, 131-145 pages, (Wang et al.Curr Diabetes Rev.10,131-145,2014) is summarized within 2014). 
 Female db/db mouse is in 7 week old from Charles River (JAX TM  Mice Strain BKS.Cg-Dock7 m 
+/+Lepr db J it) obtains.After a week, mouse is randomly divided into 4 big groups, per greatly group 5 mouse, receive respectively with purifying 71G3,
The processing that 71D6,71G2 or only carrier (PBS) carry out.Antibody by intraperitoneal injection dosage twice a week be 1mg/kg carry out to
Medicine.Blood sugar concentration under every 14 days monitoring fasted conditions, continues 8 weeks.After treatment 7 weeks, i.e., when mouse is 15 week old, carry out
Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT). 
 As shown in figure 24, the about 230mg/dL in randomization of the average basal blood sugar concentration in big group of PBS, this is absolutely right
It should be in the level of diabetic.These values are tended to increase with time, and at the end of experiment big group of PBS (after i.e. 8 weeks)
In mean blood glucose concentrations be about 330mg/dL.On the contrary, the basal plasma glucose in big group for receiving antibody processing, under fasted conditions
Constantly decline at any time.At the end of experiment, big group of 71G3,71D6 and 71G2 of mean blood glucose concentrations be respectively 173mg/dL,
138mg/dL and 165mg/dL. 
 After treatment 7 weeks, i.e., when mouse is 15 week old, we test the urgency that they attack glucose and insulin
Property response.It should be remembered that these mouse are hyperinsulinemias compared with the mouse (referring to embodiment 21) handled with STZ and show
Show elevated blood glucose levels, because they are insulin resistances.In fact, when using glucose challenge in GTT, big group of PBS
Mouse fails to show normal glucose uptake curve.All mouse show that blood glucose sharply increases, in the entirely test phase
Between still increase.Symmetrically, when carrying out ITT, identical mouse shows the abnormality response to insulin, to show Portugal
The slight and brief increase of grape sugar level.At least in preclinical models, this unusual response is the mark of insulin resistance. 
 Although the mouse that big group of antibody since lower foundation level, does not show normal grape in GTT yet
Sugar intake curve, therefore show that the anti-MET antibody of excitability cannot neutralize the acute outburst of blood glucose level.However, noticeable
Be that Antybody therapy significantly improves the response in ITT to insulin really, thus reversed observed in big group of PBS it is anti-
Chang Xiaoying and ITT curve is made to seem to be more closely similar to non-diabetic mice (C57BLKS/J；Charles Rivet) it shows
Show.We conclude that: the type-2 diabetes mellitus of db/db mouse is improved using the long-term treatment of the anti-MET antibody of excitability, and
And part overcomes insulin resistance. 
 Based on these results with being provided in preceding embodiment as a result, it is proposed that people/mouse equivalence anti-MET of excitability
Antibody can be used for clinic to treat pathological condition relevant to elevated blood glucose levels.These can include: type-1 diabetes mellitus, II type glycosuria
Diabetes sample illness (such as metabolic syndrome) sick or that other are characterized by high glucose and/or insulin resistance. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 23: activity in vivo: the fatty liver in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease mouse model improves 
 
 It has been shown that the target gene missing of MET leads to serious nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mouse in liver
(NASH) morbidity (Kroy et al., hepatopathy magazine, 61 phases, 883-890 pages, (Kroy et al.J in 2014
Hepatol.61,883-890,2014)).In an independent studies (Kosone et al., American Physiological magazine-gastrointestinal tract and liver
Dirty physiology, 293 phases, G204-210 pages, (Kosone et al., Am J Physiol Gastrointest in 2007
Liver Physiol.293, G204-210,2007)) in, HGF by activation microsomal triglyceride transporter (MTP) and
The fatty liver that high fat diet induces in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) Lai Gaishan mouse, to reduce the storage of fatty acid to the maximum extent
It deposits. 
 Hyperinsulinism db/db mouse is also widely used as the model of NASH, is more commonly used for the model of Fatty Liver Disease.Just
In normal diet, these mouse have accumulated a large amount of lipid in its liver cell, so as to cause hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and slow
Property hepatic failure.Such case can be further exacerbated by (by Anstee and Goldin, world reality by the way that mouse is placed in high fat diet
Test pathology magazine, 87 phases, 1-16 pages, 2006 (Anstee and Goldin, Int J Exp Pathol.87,1-16,
2006) it is summarized). 
 Under the promotion of above-mentioned observation and consideration, whether we test the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability and can
Enough improve the moderate fatty degeneration of liver of db/db mouse in normal diet.For this purpose, we obtain female db/db as described above
Mouse.When animal be 8 week old when, they are randomly divided into 4 big groups, per greatly group 6 mouse, receive respectively with purifying 71G3,
The processing that 71D6,71G2 or only carrier (PBS) carry out.Antibody by intraperitoneal injection dosage twice a week be 1mg/kg carry out to
Medicine.After processing 8 weeks, puts to death mouse and perform an autopsy on sb. to it.Liver is extracted, is embedded in paraffin and is handled and be used for tissue
It learns and checks.Blood is collected for analyzing liver function marker. 
 Liver section h and E or Picro Picro-Sirius red are dyed to protrude fibrosis.As shown in figure 25,
Apparent steatosis is shown from big group of liver of PBS, is generally focused on around central vein.Liver cell is significantly expanded simultaneously
Rich in lipid.Fatty liver cell is mixed with normal liver cell, and steatosis ply in the centre surrounding space up to
60%.On the contrary, the liver of the animal from antibody processing contains significant less fat cell, and totally seem very just
Often.As shown in figure 26, Picro sirius red stains confirm: having the door week fibrosis of moderate in PBS group, it is characterised in that liver
Hypothallus around triplet (portal vein, arteria hepatica and bile duct) thickens, and expands to small interlobar fissure sometimes.It is worth noting that,
Much lower fibrosis (if any) is shown from big group of liver section of all antibody.To liver function mark in blood plasma
The analysis of object AST and ALT confirm these observations result (referring to fig. 2 7).In fact, moving with the anti-MET Antybody therapy of excitability
Object shows abnormal low AST and ALT plasma concentration, about 2.5 times lower than PBS group and than the average AST of normal mouse and
Horizontal low 2 times of ALT. 
 These statistics indicate that: the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can be used for it is clinical with treat NASH or with fat
Other relevant pathological conditions of liver.The anti-MET antibody of excitability can be used for inhibiting lipid accumulation, prevention or reverse liver in liver cell
Cytosis, and fatty acid is inhibited to gather the vicious circle occurred between macrophages infiltration.Chronic inflammation always causes
The deposition of extracellular matrix.Therefore, the anti-MET antibody of excitability can also be used for reducing the relevant fibrosis of steatosis. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 24: body activity: the wound healing of diabetic mice 
 
 Clinically relevant diabetic complication shows as ulcer increase and wound healing is impaired.Due to HGF and wound healing
Related (Nakamura et al., gastroenterology and hepatology magazine, page 1,188-202, (Nakamura et al., J in 2011
Gastroenterol Hepatol.1,188-202,2011)), it is intended to whether determine the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence
It can promote the healing of wound in diabetes background.For this purpose, we obtain db/db diabetic mices as described above.In 8 week old
When, we anaesthetize animal, and then the circular wound using circular perforations blade in right lateral side cutting 0.8cm wide carries out skin
Skin biopsy (GIMA).Remove entire epidermis.Second day after surgery, mouse is randomly divided into 4 big groups, is received with purifying
71G3,71D6 and 71G2 or the processing only carried out with carrier (PBS).It is 5mg/kg that antibody, which every other day passes through intraperitoneal injection dosage,
It is delivered.Calliper to measure wound diameter is used daily. 
 As shown in figure 28, Antybody therapy substantially speeds up wound closure and re-epithelialization.When big group of control with daily averagely 5%
Rate reparative experiment wound when, this value increases to 8% in big group of 71G3, increase to 12% in big group of 71D6, and
Increase to 11% in big group of 71G2. 
 It is proposed that: the anti-MET antibody of people/mouse equivalence excitability can be used for clinic to treat the relevant ulcer of diabetes
The wound impaired with healing is typically exhibited.The relevant ulcer of diabetes represents unsatisfied medical demand.In the U.S., glycosuria
The main reason for disease is atraumatic lower limb amputation.The anti-MET antibody of excitability can be used for healing acceleration, improve re-epithelialization and promote
The vascularization of the ulcer induced into hyperglycemia. 
 
 
   Embodiment 25: with Rattus norvegicus (Rattus norvegicus) And machin (Macaca fascicularis) MET   Cross reactivity   
 Since the animal model of most human diseases uses mouse as host, the cross reactivity with murine antigen is
The prerequisite of antibody, needs are verified in preclinical system.This is to promote us to identify that people-mouse is of equal value to resist
The basic principle of MET antibody.However, some preclinical programs (such as organ transplant and other realities for needing complicated surgical operation
Test and practice) preferably carried out in biggish rodent or primate.In addition, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic are preferred
It is carried out in higher vertebrate (usually rat and monkey).Finally and most of all, therapeutic antibodies toxicology
Evaluation ideally carries out in monkey；Alternatively, if it is not possible, then in two different rodent species into
Row.It therefore, is also ideal expectation with the cross reactivity of rat and monkey. 
 For this purpose, we have studied the anti-MET antibody of our people/mouse equivalence whether with it is (including brown from other species
Home mouse (Rattus norvegicus) and machin (Macaca fascicularis)) MET cross reaction occurs.Pass through standard
Protein engineering obtains rat MET ECD (NCBI#NP_113705.1；1-931 aa) and monkey MET ECD (NCBI#
XP_005550635.2；1-948 aa).People and mouse MET ECD are used as compareing.Selection represents SEMA conjugate
The restricted antibody group of (71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,71G2) and PSI conjugate (76H10,71G3).The 5D5 prior art
Antibody is used as compareing.MET ECD proteinaceous solid is scheduled in solid phase (hole 100ng/, 96 orifice plates), and is exposed in solution and passs
The antibody of enrichment degree (0-40nM) (there is human constant region).In conjunction with the anti-human Fc antibodies being conjugated by using HRP, (Jackson exempts from
Epidemic disease research laboratory (Immuno Research Laboratories)) it is disclosed.As shown in figure 29, the owner of test/
The antibody of mouse equivalence is with similar affinity and capacity combination people, mouse, rat and monkey MET, and 5D5 is only in conjunction with human and ape
MET.We conclude that: at least as measured by ELISA, 71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,71G2,76H10 and 71G3 are anti-
Body is with similar affinity and capacity combination people MET, mouse MET, rat MET and ape MET. 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 26: fine epitope mapping 
 
 For the MET epitope of finely positioning people/mouse equivalence anti-MET antibody identification, we use following strategy.We
Infer: if generating in llama and cross reaction occurring for the antibody of people MET and mouse MET, this antibody can
It can recognize that and guard but in homo sapiens (H.sapiens) and house mouse (M.musculus) in homo sapiens, house mouse and llama
(L.glama) residue that do not guarded in.Same deduction extends to Rattus norvegicus (R.norvegicus) and machin
(M.fascicularis)。 
 In order to be studied along this line, we compare and compare people (UniProtKB#P08581；1-932
Aa), mouse (UniProtKB#P16056.1；1-931 aa), rat (NCBI#NP_113705.1；1-931 aa),
Machin (NCBI#XP_005550635.2；1-948 aa) and llama MET (GenBank#KF042853.1；1-931
Position aa) between amino acid sequence (Figure 30).Reference table 12, we be primarily focused on be responsible in conjunction with 71D6,71C3,
71D4,71A3 and 71G2 antibody (the 314-372 aa of people MET) and the combination 76H10 and 71G3 antibody (546- of people MET
562 aa) the area MET in.In the front region (314-372 aa) of people MET, exists and guarded in people and mouse MET
But 5 residues (Ala 327, Ser 336, Phe 343, Ile 367, Asp 372) that do not guarded in llama MET.Scheming
In 30, these amino acid black surround and progressive number 1-5 are indicated.Wherein, 4 residues (Ala 327, Ser 336, Ile
367, Asp 372) it is also to guard in rat and machin MET.In the back region (546-562 aa) of people MET,
In the presence of three residues (Arg 547, Ser 553, Thr for guarding in people and mouse MET but not guarded in llama MET
555).In Figure 30, these amino acid black surround and progressive number 6-8 are indicated.Wherein, two residue (553 Hes of Ser
Thr 555) it is also to guard in rat and machin MET. 
 User MET is as template, we are with each of different these residues of arrangement mutagenesis, to generate a system
Arrange the MET mutant of the full people other than specific residue (llama).The signal of mutant is illustrated in Figure 31.Next, we
Selected SEMA combination mAb (71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,71G2) and PSI combination mAb are tested by ELISA
(76H10 and 71G3) is to the affinity of these MET mutant.For this purpose, by various MET proteopexies solid phase (hole 100ng/, 96
Orifice plate) in, it is then exposed to antibody (0-50nM) solution of progressive concentration.Since the antibody used is its human constant region form,
Therefore it is disclosed and is combined using the anti-human Fc secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) of HRP conjugation.It is wild
Raw type people MET is used as positive control.The result of the analysis is listed in table 24. 
 Table 24: the epitope representative for being responsible for the MET that agonistic antibody combines is protected in homo sapiens, house mouse, Rattus norvegicus, machin
The residue kept but do not guarded between same species and llama.It is tested by ELISA in people, mouse, rat, machin
The conservative residue that do not guarded in llama MET singly and the correlation for combining excitability mAb.By wild type (WT) or saltant type
(MT) people MET ECD is fixed in solid phase, and is exposed to the mAb of progressive concentration in solution.It is disclosed and is combined using anti-human Fc secondary antibody.
All associated values are normalized to WT albumen, and are expressed as the combination percentage (E compared with WT MET MAX ).Each mutant
(A-L) containing at least two mutation (1-8), as shown in figure 31. 
 
 
 
 Result given above provides the clear of the related residue of the agonistic antibody in conjunction with us and clearly image. 
 The SEMA conjugate (71D6,71C3,71D4,71A3,71G2) of all tests seems to combine same epitope, contain
2 in SEMA β-propeller blade 5 are guarded in people, mouse, machin and rat MET but in llama MET
The key amino acid that do not guard: Ile 367 and Asp 372.In fact, the mutation of Ala 327, Ser 336 or Phe 343 are basic
It does not influence to combine；The mutation of Ile 367 keeps bound fraction impaired；The mutation of Ile 367 and Asp 372 completely eliminate combination.
We conclude that: the Ile 367 and Asp 372 of people MET is to Guan Chong for combining tested SEMA orientation antibody
It wants.These three residues are indicated in Figure 30 with " S " (for SEMA). 
 In addition, the PSI conjugate (76H10,71G3) of test seems to combine identical epitope.However, with SEMA epitope phase
Instead, PSI table position is only also guarded in people, mouse, machin and rat MET but is not guarded in llama MET containing one
Key amino acid: Thr 555.In fact, the mutation of Arg 547 or Ser 553 do not influence to combine, and Thr's 555 is prominent
Change completely eliminates combination.We conclude that: Thr 555 is represented for the PSI of test orientation antibody combines to pass
Important determinant.The residue is indicated in Figure 30 with " P " (for PSI). 
 
 
 
 Embodiment 27: people/mouse equivalence agonistic antibodies uniqueness 
 
 
 
 The fine epitope positioning result presented in embodiment 26 provides the detailed proof of molecule, that is, provided by the invention
The specific characteristic that there is agonistic antibody any prior art molecule not have.It can be best understood by executing following analysis
This uniqueness. 
 Antibody for the most prior art discussed in embodiment 12-14, there is no identify on MET about them
Fine epitope available information.However, it is understood that these epitopes must from our antibody identify epitope it is different because
The molecule of the prior art all not with mouse MET cross reaction.The example of a this multifarious enlightenment is by 5D5/
Onartuzumab is provided, it is the detailed molecular information being uniquely annotated in the prior art about itself and MET interaction
Anti- MET antibody.5D5/Onartuzumab identification is located at 4 kinds of different residues in SEMA β-propeller blade 5, closely
Be responsible for interacting with our SEMA binding antibody amino acid (Merchant et al., National Academy of Sciences proceeding, 110
Phase, E2987-2996 pages, 2013 (Merchant et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110, E2987-2996,
2013)).Correspond to Gln 328, Arg 331, Leu with these residues that " O " (for Onartuzumab) is indicated in Figure 30
337 and Asn 338. 
 It is worth noting that, these residues are not conservative between homo sapiens and house mouse.This with use mouse as
Host generate 5D5/Onartuzumab concept it is completely the same, and explain why it not with mouse MET cross reaction
(Merchant et al. (seeing above) and the data that we list in Fig. 6 and Figure 29).In addition, there is no one in these residues
A is conservative between homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus, but they are all conservative between homo sapiens and machin.This explains be assorted
5D5/Onartuzumab does not combine rat MET, but it combines machin MET (Figure 29) really. 
 With 5D5/Onartuzumab and the every other prior art molecule being discussed herein on the contrary, our people/mouse etc.
The antibody of valence is generated by using llama as host, and clearly screens they and people and mouse MET cross reaction
Ability.Due in a few amino acids that are conservative between homo sapiens and house mouse but not guarded in homo sapiens, house mouse and llama
Most of (shown in the black surrounds in Figure 30) also guarded in Rattus norvegicus and house mouse, chance has determined selected antibody also and greatly
Mouse and monkey cross reaction. 
 In short, immunization strategy and screening design all make antibody of the invention be unique.On the one hand, for immune object
Kind of (llama (L.glama)) and homo sapiens, house mouse, Rattus norvegicus and machin sufficiently distant apart, to guarantee and come from other
There are enough mispairing in amino acid sequence of the MET of species compared to llama MET (see Figure 30).These mispairing are most important
, because immune host cannot generate the antibody for being identified as the epitope of " itself " for it.On the other hand, people/mouse is dual
The antibody for the epitope that screening scheme forces those identifications of selection to be guarded between the two species.The step is also necessary, because
For not there are two types of species elutriation, people need to only simply choose most representative antibody or show higher
The antibody of affinity, but it is not necessarily the antibody of cross reactivity.Introduce the two standards (the 5th species and ' bis- leaching ' sides
