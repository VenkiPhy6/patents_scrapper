More specifically, the present invention relates to the use of a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain expressing the F4 (or K88) attachment factor, to either promote growth in animals or homogenize growth among a herd of animals.      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Growth promotion is a crucial issue for farm and breeding specialists, who mainly seek to optimize the production of healthy animals before slaughter or for research purposes. Such a concern should lead them to use growth promoting products that would prove beneficial to the animals and also to humans, in the case of meat-producing animals. It has been disclosed in the art, namely, in US patent no. 6 500 423, that the use of a formulation containing a F4-negative E. coli strain of human origin and a vegetal volatile fraction allegedly improve weight gain in piglets. The growth promotion observed was associated with the vegetal volatile fraction and not the F4-negative E. co/istrain. One major caveat in farms and breeding environments is the weight loss, slow growth rate along with a recrudescence of concomitant diseases, drug cost, and mortality which lead to a decrease in animal yields and ultimately to considerable economic losses. In this connection, post-weaning or post-hatching animals are particularly vulnerable to agents impeding growth. Infections caused by either non-hygienic conditions or close proximity between animals, for example, are among the most common factors leading to the above-mentioned caveat.     al. and Schwarz S el al.). In fact, in the last ten years, there has been an emergence of more pathogenic and more antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli strains and/or husbandry changes (early weaning) and/or new European regulations forbidding use of antimicrobial agents as growth promoters or for prophylaxis treatment (prevention of diseases) and use of high levels of heavy metals, such as zinc oxide in the feed. The weaning period is particularly associated with higher antibiotic use during animal production. Consequently, there is now a growing resistance to the use of antibiotic growth promoters and heavy metals due to recrudescence of antibiotic resistance, allergic reactions to antibiotic residues, and contamination of cultivated soil. Another caveat that farm and breeding specialists also have to face is growth heterogeneity among herds of animals. More specifically, in a purpose of optimized meat production for example, farmers seek to produce consistent herds of animals displaying the most homogeneous growth rate possible before slaughter, to avoid increased costs. However, animals generally present different rates of growth and different vulnerabilities to infectious agents, among others. There is thus a constant need for innovating agents that promote growth of animals and that advantageously further contribute to homogenize and optimize animal growth. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one broad aspect, the present invention relates to a method for promoting growth of an animal, said method comprising an intestinal delivery in said animal of an effective amount of live non-pathogenic Escherichia coil strain comprising F4 adhesins, and feeding said animal with a feed ration ad libitum, wherein said animal has increased growth compared to a control animal of similar age and condition, fed a similar feed ration ad libitum but which has not had said intestinal delivery.  
 2 In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a method for reducing the feed conversion rate of an animal, said method comprising a gastro-intestinal tract delivery in said animal of an effective amount of live non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins, and feeding said animal less food than is required to feed a control animal of similar age and condition but which has not had said intestinal delivery, to achieve the same growth. In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a method for promoting growth of an animal, said method comprising a gastro-intestinal tract delivery in said animal of an effective amount of live non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins, and feeding said animal with a feed ration ad libitum, wherein said animal has increased growth compared to a control animal of similar age and condition, fed a similar feed ration ad libitum but which has not had said intestinal delivery In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a composition comprising a live non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins and a feed acceptable carrier, the composition being adapted for gastro-intestinal tract delivery in an animal to reduce the feed conversion rate of the animal compared to a control animal of similar age and condition. In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a composition comprising a live non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins and a feed acceptable carrier, the composition being adapted for gastro-intestinal tract delivery in an animal to promote growth of the animal compared to a control animal of similar age and condition. In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to an isolated Escherichia coli strain identical to the Escherichia coli strain deposited at the International Depository Authority of Canada (IDAC) on January 21, 2005 under accession number IDAC 210105-01. In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a product for gastro-intestinal tract delivery in an animal, said product comprising a live non-2a pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins, the strain being in an amount sufficient for administration of at least 5 x 107 CFU per animal. In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a product for gastro-intestinal tract delivery in an animal, comprising a live non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins, wherein the strain is in an amount sufficient to promote growth of the animal. In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a product for gastro-intestinal tract delivery in an animal, comprising providing a sample including a non-pathogenic live non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain comprising F4 adhesins; and lyophilizing said sample to obtain a lyophilized product, wherein said sample includes an amount sufficient of the strain to promote growth of the animal upon said gastro-intestinal tract delivery In one embodiment, the composition as described herein is in lyophilized form 2b Owing to the use of Fe non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, the invention finds an advantage in situations wherein rapid growth promotion and growth homogenization of an animal are particularly needed. For instance, use of Fe non-pathogenic Escherichia coil strains in animals reared for meat production allows to bring these animals to market weight or slaughter weight in a shorter growing period than that of their untreated counterparts. The present invention may further find an advantage for growth promotion and growth homogenization of laboratory animals, such as rats and mice. As can be appreciated, bringing these laboratory animals to a given weight faster and more homogeneously preferably provides for more homogeneous and readily available samples of animals. Another advantage of the present invention is that there is no recourse to antibiotic use to promote growth in animals. Therefore, problems such as development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains or allergies to antibiotics which particularly affect post-weaning animals, are alleviated. Moreover, since heavy metals such as zinc oxide are not added to the animal's feed, contamination of the soil is also avoided. In other words, the present invention also provides for environment-friendly uses and methods. The improved efficiency of feed conversion attained by the present method enables treated animals to reach any desired weight while consuming less food than untreated animals grown to the same weight. Moreover, while practicing the  
 3 method of the present invention, neither toxic side effects nor decrease in general health status due to the bacterium is observed in the treated animals. The invention and its advantages will be better understood upon reading the following non-restrictive description of preferred embodiments thereof, made with reference to the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a photograph showing the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern of Xbal-digested genomic DNA of a preferred F4+ non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain used in accordance with the present invention. The preferred strain is the coliPROtec strain. Figure 2 is a graph that displays the percentage of weight gain in pigs for each period after treatment with Fe Escherichia coil strains. Figure 3 is a graph that displays the percentage of weight gain in mice after treatment with F4+ Escherichia coli strains.      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The originality of the present invention stems from new uses for F4+ non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. More particularly and according to a first aspect, the present invention relates to the use of an effective amount of an F4+  non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain to promote growth in an animal.   According to a second aspect, the present invention relates to the use of an effective amount of an F4+ non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain to homogenize growth among a herd of animals. According to related aspects, the present invention relates to a method of promoting growth in an animal and to a method of homogenizing growth among a herd of animals.  
 - 4 -Both methods comprise the step of feeding the animal(s) with an effective amount of an F44 non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain. The strain used in the present invention is characterized in that it expresses the attachment factor F4, while being non-pathogenic. According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the F44 non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain is selected from the group consisting of coliPROtec (Accession number IDAC 210105-01), JG1329, M226, P03-7586(175) or pMK005. More preferably, the present invention contemplates using the coliPROtec strain and/or mutants or variants thereof (see Example I for more details). As used herein, the terms "mutants" and "variants of the coliPROtec strain are used for strains that have all the identifying characteristics of the coliPROtec strain, as provided in Example I. Mutant or variant strains may be identified as having a genome or part thereof that hybridizes under conditions of high stringency to the genome of the coliPROtec strain. According to the above-mentioned aspects of the invention, the above-described strain is used in an "effective amount". By the expression "effective amount", it will be understood that the amount of an F44 non-pathogenic Escherichia coil strain is the amount that will elicit the biological response of a tissue, system or animal that is being sought by the researcher or the veterinarian, for example. In other words, such an effective amount of an F44 non-pathogenic Escherichia coil strain is the amount that is sufficient for promoting growth in an animal as well as homogenizing growth among a herd of animals. It will be understood that a preferred effective amount of the strain contemplated by the present invention is at least about 5E7 colony-forming units (CFU), and more preferably range from about 5E7 to about 5E9 CFU of the strain of interest per animal. By "about", it is meant that the CFU value of said strain can vary within a certain range depending on the margin of error of the method used to evaluate the number of CFU for such a strain.                   =  
 - 5 - 
 6 The effective amount to be used may vary according to a number of factors. For instance, type of animal, initial weight of the animal, growth phase of the animal, environment i.e. animal facilities, type and management of production, hygienic status of the facilities, stress after weaning or hatching, feed and supplements used, health of the animal and concomitant diseases or treatment, may be factors to take into account. As mentioned above, the objectives of growth promotion and growth homogenization are achieved in an animal. As used herein, the term "animal"  refers to any young or adult animal suitable to be used in accordance with the present invention. More preferably, the term "animal" refers to a post-weaning or a post-hatching animal. Since in either a post-weaning or post-hatching animal, maternal feeding and caring are no longer available, growth promoting agents are of the utmost importance. Such a concern is particularly crucial, for instance, in the case of animals bred for their meat. In the context of the present invention, preferred animals to be used can be any one of the following: farm animals such as pigs and more preferably post-weaning pigs; poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese, hens or turkeys, preferably, chickens and more preferably broiler chickens; cattle such as cows, steers, bulls or oxen; game animals such as ostriches or bisons; domestic animals, for example cats or dogs; and laboratory animals, such as mice or rats.  Of course, these animals are all characterized in that growth promotion and growth homogenization are desired features, in particular when meat production is the goal. In view of the above, it will be understood that the animals may receive the strain of the invention for substantially the whole of their growing period, or for only a part of their growing period, for example the early part and/or the period leading up to slaughter.     According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the post-weaning animal is preferably a pig, preferably aged from about 10 to about 28 days old, at the onset of the trials. The pig of interest is more preferably 17 days old. According to another preferred aspect of the invention, the post-weaning animal is preferably a mouse, preferably aged from about 18 to about 28 days old, at the onset of the trials. The mouse of interest is more preferably 21 days old. According to yet another preferred aspect of the invention, the post-hatching animal is preferably a chicken, preferably aged from about 1 to about 7 days old, at the onset of the trials. The chicken of interest is more preferably 1 day old. It will be understood that the expression "about 1 day old" means 24 hours or less after birth or hatching. According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the effective amount that can be given to pigs preferably varies from 5E7 to 5E9 CFU/ pig and is more preferably about 1E9 CFU/pig. According to another preferred aspect, the effective amount that can be given to chickens varies from about 5E7 to 5E9 CFU/chicken, and is more preferably 5E8 CFU/chicken. According to yet another preferred aspect, the effective amount that can be given to mice varies from about 5E7 to 5E9 CFU/mouse, and is more preferably 5E8 CFU/mouse. In the particular context of the methods of the invention, the effective amount of the strain may be fed to the animal as a single dosage or may be given according to a regimen, whereby it is effective. By the term "feeding", it should be understood that an F4+ non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain of the invention is provided to the animal under treatment so that the strain eventually reaches the gastro-intestinal tract, and more preferably the intestines.  
 - 7 -For instance, and according to a preferred aspect of the invention, feeding can be done by orally feeding the strain to the animal of interest. According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the strain is preferably fed to the animal in lyophilized form. According to another preferred aspect, the strain of the invention is diluted or suspended with a diluent or carrier. In accordance with the present invention, the F4+ non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain is used to "promote growth" in an animal or to "homogenize growth among a herd animals". These expressions refer to the use of the Escherichia coli strain to increase an animal's growth rate. In other words, upon treatment with the strain of interest, the animal's weight increases more rapidly and more homogeneously compared with its untreated counterparts. More particularly, the expression "growth homogenization" in the context of the present invention refers to a relative control over the rate of growth in a herd of animals. This type of control bears a particular interest in the field of animal breeding and meat production in which all the animals in a given group must ideally reach their growth peak faster, at relatively the same time among the group, with conventional amounts of feed along with a non-toxic growth promoting agent.  When these conditions are met, feeding costs, slaughter costs and shipping costs can all be optimized.   In order to evaluate growth promotion and growth homogenization, a number of parameters known in the field can be determined. More specifically, such parameters, evaluated either alone or in combination, can encompass: Mean body weight (MBW) : mean of the body weights of a group of animals;      Mean daily weight gain (DWG): mean increase in weight per day, per group of animals, during a particular period; iii-            Feed intake (Fl): quantity of feed ingested per animal or per group of animals during a particular period; and  
 - 8 -iv-             Feed conversion ratio (FCR): feed intake per animal or per group of animals for a particular period / Weight gain for the same animal or group of animals for the same particular period. Advantageously, the strain of the invention may be used alone or in association with a feed acceptable carrier. As used herein, the expression "feed acceptable carrier" refers to any carrier, diluent or excipient that is compatible with the strain of the invention and can be given to an animal without adverse effects.  Suitable feed acceptable carriers known in the art include, but are not limited to, water, saline, glucose, dextrose, or buffered solutions. Such a carrier is advantageously non-toxic to the strain and not harmful to the animal. It may also be biodegradable. A person skilled in the art will know how to select suitable carriers, such as carriers that are not harmful to the environment. Preferably also, this carrier is a suitable solid or liquid feed acceptable carrier. A suitable solid feed acceptable carrier is a non-toxic ingestable carrier.  For instance, this solid feed acceptable carrier may be a common solid feedstuff such as the component of a typical animal diet consisting of cereal products, such as barley meal, maize meal or wheat feed, nut and seed products, such as decorticated ground nut cake or cotton seed cake, or extracted cotton seed cake, together with minor amounts of, for example, feather meal, seaweed meal, bone meal, bone flour, chalk, salt, urea and vitamins; or it may be an inert solid diluent or carrier of no nutritional value, for example kaolin, talc, calcium carbonate, fuller's earth, attapulgus clay, ground oyster shells or ground limestone; or it may be starch or lactose. A suitable liquid feed acceptable carrier is, for example, water and preferably drinking water; milk such as whole or skim milk; or a culture medium such as a trypsone soy broth (TSB). The following examples illustrate the wide range of potential applications of the present invention and are not intended to limit its scope. Modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the  
 - 9 -invention. Although any method and material similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described. EXAMPLES      EXAMPLE l: Description of the Escherichia coli strain (coliPROtec strain) and its clones According to a preferred feature of the invention, an F4+ non-pathogenic Escherichia col/ strain (referred hereinafter as the coliPROtec or the JFF4 strain) is used. The coliPROtec strain was deposited at the International Depositary Authority of Canada on January 21st, 2005 and was attributed accession number IDAC 210105-01. 1. Origin The strain was isolated from feces of a healthy pig at the Escherichia coil Laboratory at the Faculty of veterinary medicine, University of Montreal, Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada. Animals were purchased from a local farm located in Monteregie, Quebec, Canada. 2. Stability of the strain The expression of F4 fimbriae, an immunogenic protein, of the coliPROtec strain was stabilized using in vitro passages. Three (3) consecutive 10L  fermentations were done. After each fermentation, the culture was inoculated on agar and 10 colonies were tested for F4 fimbriae expression using a slide agglutination test.  Bacteria from F4+ colonies were pooled and used for the consecutive fermentation. The strain was then frozen in trypsone soy broth (TSB) supplemented with 20% glycerol. After thawing, the F4 expression of the strain was not totally stable and several consecutive fermentations (approximately  
 10) were needed to obtain a stable strain. The stable strain was freeze-dried after approximately 15 passages from the pig. This freeze-dried culture was used to produce the Master Seed of coliPROTec. 3. Biochemical analysis An identification of the strain was done using the API system. The identification code 5544572 obtained referred as an Escherichia coli strain. 4. Virotyping Virotyping of the coliPROtec strain was done by colony hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virotyping results showed that the coliPROtec strain was positive for F4 whereas it was negative for the following toxins:    LT, STa, STb, STaH, Stx1, Stx2, VT2vpl, VT2vh, Aero, Tsh, CDT3, CDT4, CNF1, CNF2, HlyA, HlyC, Ehx, East1. Furthermore, the coliPROtec strain was also negative for the following adhesins or putative adhesins: F5, F6, F18, F41, F17, P fimbriae, AIDA, AFA, SFA, CS31a, daaE, Paa, aggR, ARF/1, Eae, CFAI, CFAII(CS1coo), CFAII(CS3cst). 5. DNA fingerprinting The coliPROtec strain was characterized using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (Figure 1). Particular clones of the strain, for which the F4 fimbriae expression was stable after fermentation, were selected following repeated in vitro passages. 6.

Results During the innocuity studies of the coliPROtec strain, a positive effect of the product was observed on the weight gain of the animals. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, pigs treated with only one oral dose of coliPROtec at the beginning of the post-weaning period had a daily weight gain higher by 53g when compared to untreated animals. Specifically, 2 weeks after the treatment, treated pigs were 849g heavier than untreated pigs.

Analysis and Conclusion At day 5 post-weaning, giving coliPROtec, the weight of the Groups 1 and 2 (untreated and treated with coliPROtec) was not statistically different.  However, at day 20 post-weaning (15 days after the treatment), the treated animals were 849g heavier and demonstrated a daily weight gain of 53g more than untreated animals. These differences were statistically significant. Of note, the conventional antibiotic growth promoters generally increase the weight gain by .3,3 to 8,8% (Doyle, M.E., Food Research Institute, University of Wisconsin, 2001). As demonstrated here, the coliPROtec strain increased the daily weight gain by 11% during the 2 weeks following the single dose.

From day 0 to day 14, pigs were fed with a commercial starter feed containing 23% protein without addition of zinc oxide or antibiotics. For the last 3 days, the feed contained 19% protein. 3.        Results 3.1 Fe Escherichia coli and pathogenic ETEC status of pigs At the beginning of the trial, thus before treatment, some pigs from all groups were colonized by an F4+ strain possessing the toxin STb (Table 4). All pigs of the control group (Group 1) and of the group treated with an F4- Escherichia coli strain (Group 2), were colonized by this F4:STb strain at day 9 (Table 5).  Although this strain (045:F4:STb) is not a usual ETEC strain causing post-weaning diarrhea in pigs, we can not exclude that it is pathogenic. However, no animal demonstrated clinical signs associated with post-weaning diarrhea during the trial. Since both control groups were colonized by this F4+ strain, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of the tested F4+ strains on animal growth performance.

The linear model with repeated measures, using the day as within-subject factor and the group as between-subject factor, showed no effect of treatment on growth of pigs (p = 0.90). Post hoc analysis checked for differences between each treated group (groups 2 to 7) and the control group (group 1) at each day (Table 6). Weight was significantly higher for group 7, compared to the control group, at day 9 only (p = 0,045). Other weight differences were not significant.  
 - 18 -Nevertheless, Groups 3 and 7, treated with the JFF4 and the recombinant strains, respectively, had a higher weight at days 4 and 9, but weights were subsequently more similar between groups (Table 6). During the first period of the trial (days 0 to 4), groups 3 and 7 had a percentage of weight gain of 18 and 15%, respectively, compared to 11% for both control groups (Groups 1 and 2;  Figure 2). The low weight gain observed for the group 4 during this first period was attributed to 3 pigs that lost weight. During the second period (days 4 to 9), groups 2, 4, 6 and 7 had a higher percentage of weight gain than that of the untreated group (group 1). The percentage of weight gain was more homogeneous during the third period (days 9 to 14) and was higher for groups 2 and 3 than for group 1, during the last period.

During the trial, chickens had ad libitum access to feed and water. They were observed twice daily for the general health and presence of diarrhea. From day to day 24, chickens received a standard commercial feed for chicks (without antibiotics). From day 24 to day 28, they received a standard development commercial feed (without antibiotics). 3. Results 3.1 FeEscherichia coli and pathogenic ETEC status of chickens No fecal sample was positive for F4, STa, STb or LT at day 0, before treatment.  Fecal excretion of F44. Escherichia coil was detected in treated groups (groups 3 to 7) at days 2 and 4, but not subsequently. 3.2 General health and diarrhea assessment Animals were in good health during the trial and no diarrhea was observed. Three (3) animals of group 7 were euthanized at day 23 or 25 due to their deteriorating general health status. No gastro-intestinal clinical sign was observed in these chickens. Necropsy reports on these chickens from the Pathology department (FacultO de medecine veterinaire, Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada) revealed that these chickens died from the ascites syndrome, a frequent non infectious disease, generally associated with cardiac insufficiency, in broiler chickens. ,

 - 22 -The DWG of all groups treated with F4+ strains was higher than that of both control groups during the days following the treatments (days 4 to 9) and during the fourth period (days 14 to 18) for group 5 (Table 8). F4-negative strain:   The MBW and DWG were similar or lower for the group treated with the F4-negative strain than for the untreated group. A linear model with repeated measures, using the day as within-subject factor and the group as between-subject factor, showed no effect of treatment on growth of chickens (p = 0.97).

Weight was not significantly different between each treated group and the untreated group on each day. Differences observed in the descriptive analysis were not significant probably due to a higher variability than expected for the weight of chickens in each group, in particular for the untreated group. 3.4 Feed intake (Fl) Table 9; Feed intake (24-hr-period) of chickens after treatment with F4+ Escherichia coif strains Feed intake (g) of groups (per animal) for 24-hour-periods Group                    Day 2       Day 9      Day 17      Day 24 1"                      144 (16,0)       576 (64,0)    1043 (115,9)    1316 (146,2) 2                       146 (16,2)       522 (58,0)    951 (105,7)    1180 (131,1) 3                       128 (1442)       570 (63,3)    018:00'1,1    1305 (145,0) 4                       138 (fki)        498 (55,31       pp., (97,8y    1389 (154,3) 5                       169 (18,8)       526 (58,4)    976 (108,4)    1274 (141,6) 6                       145 (16,1)       632 (70,2)    0,28.(102,A    1535 (170,6) 7                       144 (16,0)       695 (77,2)    1013 (112,6)    1006*2 (143,7) 1: Treatment: Group 1; control, Group 2; F4-negative Escherichia coil strain at days 1 and 4, Groups 3 to 7; F4-positive strains at days 1 and 4. *2: Two euthanized animals (n=7 instead of 9)

This ratio was lower than that of the untreated group, only at day 9.  
 - 24 -Other Fr strains: The FCR was lower than that of both control groups (groups 1 and 2) for group 7 (day 2), groups 3 and 4 (days 9 and 17), and groups 3 and 6 (day 17; table 4) F4-negative strain: The FCR of the group treated with an F4-negative strain was lower than that of the untreated group (group 1), at day 17 only. A linear model showed no effect of treatment on the feed conversion ratio of chickens (p = 0.68). 4. Analysis and Conclusion Results demonstrate that F4+ non-pathogenic E. coli strains, including the strain, increase the growth performance of chickens. The growth performance was positively affected, especially for the days immediately following the second treatment, the DWG being higher for all treated groups than for the untreated group, during days 4 to 9. Two F4+ strains, including the JFF4 strain, also had a higher DWG than both control groups during days 14 to 18. The improvement in the growth performance during the days immediately following treatments (days to 9) resulted in a higher weight for groups treated with F4+ strains than for both control groups until day 18 or, for some groups, day 23. The higher DWG observed during the short period post-treatment affected positively the MBW of treated groups until days 18 or 23, depending on the strain. Greater weight of treated groups was not associated with higher feed intake. Furthermore, Fl was sometimes lower for the treated groups than for the untreated group, thus lowering the feed conversion ratio. This effect on growth performance is associated with the F4 determinant or with strains expressing the F4 determinant since the group treated with the F4-negative Escherichia coli strain did not show this effect and had similar growth performance to the untreated group.

No difference in body weight was observed between groups. Linear model with repeated measures, using the day as within-subject factor and the group as between-subject factor, showed no effect of treatment on growth of mice (p = 0.99). Post hoc analysis checked for differences between each treated group (groups 2 to 7) and the control group (group 1) on each day. Weight was not different between each treated group and the control group on each day. Percentages of weight gain of all groups were similar during the trial period of 28 days. On the other hand, groups 1, 2, and 3 had slightly greater increase, at day 4 only (Figure 3). 3.4 Feed intake (Fl) Table 12: Feed intake of mice after treatment with F4+ Escherichia coli strains Feed intake (g) of groups for each trial period Group            0 to 4    4 to 9    9 to14    14 to 18    18 to 23    23 to

Strain JFF4: The Fl of group 3 (JFF4), was lower than that of both the untreated group (group 1) and the group treated with the F4-negative strain (group 2) between days 4 to 9, early after treatment. However, it was lower than that of the untreated group but similar to that of the group treated with the F4-negative strain for most of the following periods, except days 14 to 18 (Table 12). Other F4+ strains: The Fl of all other F4+ strains was lower than that of both control groups (groups 1 and 2) during the period days 4 to 9, early after the treatment (Table 12). Subsequently, the Fl varied, depending on the strain (Table 12). F4-negative strain: The Fl of the group treated with an F4-negative strain (group 2) was similar to that observed for the untreated group (group 1) until day 9, and was subsequently lower than the latter. Thus, the reduction of the Fl for group 2 was observed later after treatment than for groups treated with F4+ strains. The linear model showed a significant effect of the treatment on feed intake (p < 0.0001). Post-hoc Dunnett's test showed that the feed consumption was significantly higher for the control group (Group 1) than for the groups 2, 3, 4, and 7, treated with the 862, JFF4, JG1329, and pmK005 strains, respectively (Table 12). For these groups, mice ate less feed to reach the same weight. 3.5 Feed conversion ratio (FCR) Table 13: Feed intake    of mice after treatment with F4+ Escherichia coil strains Feed conversion ratio of groups Group                         Days 0-14       Days 14-28 1"                                  7,30          18,39 2                                   6,50          14,96 3                                   iJ            18,34 4                                   6,62          17,11 5                                   7,40          14,17 6                                   7,04          17,65 7                                   8,44          13,15 ": Treatment: Group 1; control, Group 2; F4-ne9ative Escherichia colt strain at days 1 and 4, Groups 3 to 7; F4+ strains at days 1 and 4.  
 - 29 -Although the difference was not significant, the FCR of the group treated with JFF4 was lower than that of any other treatment group for days 0 to 14.  Subsequently, the FCR was more variable between groups. The linear model showed no significant effect of the treatment on the FCR. 4. Analysis and conclusion The effect of F4+ Escherichia coli strains on growth seems to be less important than that observed for pigs and chickens. Nevertheless, an effect on the Fl and the FCR was observed, particularly during the growth phase of the mice (first days). Since CD-1 mice were not genetically selected for growth performance, as was the case for the chickens and pigs used in the present studies, it is possible that the mice rapidly reached the maximum weight gain and that there was thus little scope for the F4+ strains to influence weight gain, thus affecting only feed intake. Bernardeau et al. reported that the growth promoting effect of Lactobacilli was not observed in mice overfed with conventional enriched diets whereas the impact of probiotic administration was enhanced in mice fed a sub-standard diet (such as one based on barley).
