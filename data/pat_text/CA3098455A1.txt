Said copy is named 33524-40357_WO.txt, and is 26715 bytes in size. FIELD The present invention relates to bacterial inoculants, and methods for their use, to control a fungal root disease in a plant and promote plant growth in water limited conditions. BACKGROUND Root diseases are a major constraint in cropping systems worldwide. Root diseases are difficult to control with fungicides as they are below ground and management practices often provide only partial reductions in disease. Two major genera of fungal root rot pathogens are Rhizoctonia and Pythium which infect multiple crop types in broad acre and horticulture crops. These pathogens infect roots of plants, reducing germination and establishment of emerging seedlings and causing loss of root hairs and breakdown of roots in established plants and thereby reducing the plants access to water and nutrients resulting in reduced growth and yield. In broad acre cereal cropping systems these pathogens are ubiquitous and the increase in minimal or no--till tillage practices has increased the impact of these diseases. Their broad host range means there are few non-host crops to use in rotations to reduce pathogen inoculum and there are no resistant cereal cultivars available. In dryland cereal cropping systems, Rhizoctonia root rot, caused by Rhizoctonia solanianastomosis group AG8 is the main fungal root disease, especially in low rainfall zones, causing an estimated yield loss of Aus $77 mil per annum in Australia. R. oryzae is also an important root pathogen in cereals. Pythium damping off and root rot is caused by a number of Pythium species, with P. irregulare and P.  ultimum being the main species infecting cereals with the prevalence and severity of disease increasing in higher rainfall zones causing an estimated yield loss of Aus $11 mil per annum in Australia. The incidence and severity of Rhizoctonia and Pythium diseases on crop plants are known to be influenced by soil and plant associated microbes, with numerous reports of bacteria and fungi able to reduce disease under controlled conditions in pots. However, further improved microbial inoculants to control fungal root diseases in valuable crops, such as wheat or canola, are desirable.

BD141 full genome sequence In this work over 2,000 microbial strains were screened in a multi--tiered screening system to identify strains which can reduce disease when applied to seeds under field cropping conditions. Strains were sequentially screened in a high--throughput plant-- pathogen tube system, then pot bioassay systems, characterised, and selected strains assessed in field trials. Field trials were carried out in cereal growers' paddocks with naturally occurring pathogen inoculum. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a bacterial inoculant for controlling a fungal root disease on a plant. A "bacterial inoculant" as referred to herein should be understood as any isolated microorganism which may be inoculated onto a plant in order to control a fungal root disease. An "isolated" bacterial microorganism should be understood to be any bacterial microorganism which has been removed from its native environment and grown or cultured in vitro. In some embodiments, an isolated bacterial microorganism may be substantially purified and thus grown or cultured substantially in the absence of other microorganisms. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the isolated microorganism may be co--cultured with one or more additional microorganisms.   IPEA/AU  
 3 As referred to herein, terms such as "inoculating", "inoculated", "inoculation" and the like should be understood to include any method or process wherein a plant (including without limitation a plant seed, leaf, root) is brought into contact with a bacterial inoculant by human ingenuity such that the bacterial inoculant exists on or in the plant in a manner not found in nature prior to the application of the bacterial inoculant. In some embodiments inoculation may comprise the bacterial inoculant being applied to a wheat seed or canola plant seed. In some embodiments inoculation may comprise the bacterial inoculant being applied to soil in which a wheat or canola plant is growing or in which a wheat or canola seed will be planted.  In some embodiments, inoculation may comprise the bacterial inoculant being applied to root and/or shoot tissue of a wheat or canola plant. In some embodiments inoculation may be the mechanical or manual application, artificial inoculation or disposition of a bacterial inoculant onto or into a plant or plant growth medium. A  plant growth medium is any composition or environment in which a plant may be grown. In some embodiments, the plant growth medium is soil. As described later, in some embodiments, the bacterial inoculants contemplated by the present invention are from a specific genus or species, comprise a defining 16S  rRNA gene nucleotide sequence, and/or comprise a defined bacterial strain. As also set out above, the present invention contemplates control of a fungal disease of a plant. In some embodiments, the fungal disease is a root disease of a monocot or dicot plant. In some embodiments, the monocot is a cereal plant.  In some embodiments the cereal plant is member of the plant family Poaceae or Gramineae, for example: wheat, rice, corn, barley, millet, sorghum, oat, rye, or related grain producing plant. In some embodiments, the dicot is a member of the plant family Fabaceae or Leguminosae, for example: soybeans, peas, beans, lentils, peanuts, alfalfa, clover, or related plants. In some embodiments, the dicot is a member of the plant family Brassicaceae or Cruciferae, for example: canola, rapeseed, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, radish, mustard, turnip, or related plants. A "wheat plant", as referred to herein, should be understood to include plants of the genus Triticum. In some embodiments, the term "wheat" should be understood to include one or more of diploid wheat, tetraploid wheat and/or hexaploid wheat.  In  
 4 some embodiments, the wheat plant may be a cultivated species of wheat including, for example, Triticum aestivum, Triticum durum, Triticum monococcum or Triticum spelta. In some embodiments, the term "wheat" refers to wheat of the species Triticum aestivum. A "canola plant", as referred to herein, should be understood to include plants of the genus Brassica, particularly B. napus, B. rapa, B. campestris, B.  oleracea, B. montana, and hybrids thereof. In some embodiments, the term "canola"  should be understood to include one or more of rape, rapeseed, oilseed rape, Argentine canola, and colza. In some embodiments, the canola plant may be a cultivated species of canola. In some embodiments, the canola plant may be a species canola of including, for example, B. napus subsp. oleifera, B. napus subsp. napus, B. napus subsp. napus f. annua, B. napus subsp. napus f. napus, Brassica campestris subsp. napus, or Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera. In some embodiments, the term "canola" refers to canola of the species Brassica napus L and subspecies thereof. As also set out above, the present invention contemplates bacterial inoculants for the control of a fungal disease in a plant. In some embodiments, the fungal disease is a root disease of a monocot or dicot plant. In some embodiments, the present invention contemplates bacterial inoculants for the control of a fungal root disease in a wheat plant or a canola plant. In some embodiments, "control" of a fungal root disease in a plant may be understood as enhancement of one or more growth parameters in an inoculated plant relative to an uninoculated plant of the same taxon in the presence of the fungal root disease. In some embodiments, the plant is a wheat plant or a canola plant. In some embodiments, enhancement of a growth parameter will include an increase in the measured value of the growth parameter. For example, an increase in one or more of: a length and/or mass of a shoot; a length and/or mass of a root; a number and/or mass of seed; a concentration and/or amount of a nutrient; or a germination rate.     In some embodiments, an "increase" in a growth parameter may include, for example, a 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 2--fold, 5--fold, 10--fold, 20--fold, 50--fold, 100--fold increase in the growth parameter in an inoculated plant relative to a plant of the same taxon that has not been inoculated. In some embodiments, the plant is grown in the presence of a fungal root disease. In some embodiments, the plant is grown in water limited conditions.  In some embodiments, the plant is a wheat plant or a canola plant. In some embodiments, however, "enhancement" of the growth parameter may include a decrease in the measured value of the growth parameter. For example, a decrease in the concentration and/or amount of a pathogen, disease symptom and/or toxin in the plant, and/or a decrease in the time of germination of a wheat or canola plant seed, may be considered "enhancement" of such growth parameters. In some embodiments, a "decrease" in a growth parameter may include, for example, a 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% decrease in the growth parameter in an inoculated plant relative to a plant of the same taxon that has not been inoculated. In some embodiments, the plant is grown in the presence of a fungal root disease. In some embodiments, the plant is grown in water limited conditions. In some embodiments, the plant is a wheat plant or a canola plant. In some embodiments, enhancement of a growth parameter may comprise enhancement within a particular time period. For example, in some embodiments, enhancement of the growth parameter may comprise enhancement over a time period of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 days.

FIG. 1 depicts a phylogenetic tree visualizing the phylogenetic relationship between strain 9.4E, strain 10.6D, and other Paenibacillus strains. FIG. 2 depicts a phylogenetic tree visualizing the phylogenetic relationship between strain HCA1273, and other Streptomyces strains. FIG. 3 depicts a phylogenetic tree visualizing the phylogenetic relationship between strain BD141, and other Streptomyces strains. A comparison of the 16S, atpD, gyrB, recA, and trpB genes between P9 and P10 strains confirm that the isolates are distinct isolates but are closely related. For example, while sequences for 16S and gyrB are completely similar, recA     sequences have 2 SNPs between P9 and P10, trpB sequences have 6 SNPs between P9 and P10, and atpD sequences have 4 SNPs between P9 and P10. EXAMPLE 3¨ SCREENING FOR RHIZOCTONIA CONTROL All bioassays were conducted in a controlled envi9ronment room at 15 C, 12 hr day/night cycle. Wheat cv. Yitpi was used for all assays. For each assay there were three control treatments, (1) no--pathogen control (2) pathogen only control and (3) positive control of current best biocontrol strain, either Trichoderma strain TB or Streptomyces strain EN16. Bioassays were conducted in soils collected from fields with continuing Rhizoctonia problems. Soils were from Netherton SA  (grey siliceous sand) or Waikerie SA (Red calcareous sand). Primary tube Rhizoctonia bioassay This assay consisted of 50 ml tube with 60 g Netherton soil at 8% moisture content with two Rhizoctonia solani infested millet seeds added and incubated 2 weeks at 15 C. Two pregerminated wheat seeds were planted and microbial inoculum added as suspension (150 ul) directly onto the seeds and incubated for 2 wks. Plants were assessed by shoot height and number of roots reaching the bottom of the tube.  Two replicates were used per treatment. Results are shown in Table 4.

Six Rhizoctonia solani infested millet seeds were added to the soil and incubated 2 weeks at 15 C. For seed inoculation, microbes were harvested from agar plates, diluted to absorbance of 0.5 at 550nm in 3 ml dilute sticker solution (0.005% Na Alginate, 0.03% xantham gum) and 1.5 g wheat seed added and soaked for 1 hr. The microbial suspension was drained and 7 seeds planted and later thinned to 5 after germination. Inoculum concentration was determined by dilution plate counts. Plants were grown for 4 wks. Plants were assessed for root disease as Percentage of Roots Infected ( /013I) and on a Root Disease Score (RDS) on a 0-5 scale (0=no disease, 5=max disease). The length of seminal and nodal roots were measured and dry weights of roots and shoots obtained after drying at 60 C for 4 days. There were 4 replicates in a randomised complete block design. Data was analysed as ANOVA, RCBD. Results are shown in Tables 5 and 6.     Table 5 -- Results of secondary assay for strain 10.6D. Inoculum suspension 10.6D, 2.0 x 106 cfu/ml.

Selected strains were first assessed in the field in lm long single row microplots in 2012 and 2013. Wheat cv. Grenade seeds were coated with microbes as a concentrated suspension in a sticker solution (0.3% xanthan gum, 0.05% Na alginate). Seeds were hand planted at 4 cm spacing using a seeding template.  Microplot trials were a split plot design, with each treated row paired with an untreated row in a randomised complete block design, 6 replicates. Rhizoctonia root rot is a patchy disease, so a split--plot design with paired treated and untreated rows was used to measure disease in the same disease space. Plants (10) were harvested at 8 wks and assessed for root disease score (0-5 scale) caused by Rhizoctonia on seminal and nodal roots and for dry weights of roots and shoots.  Each strain was assessed at 2 sites. In 2013, Chemical seed treatments (Vibrance, Syngenta, EverGol Prime, Bayer) and Streptomyces strain EN16 were included for comparison.

Three rows of each plot were treated and three rows untreated in a split--plot randomised complete block design to allow comparison in the same disease space due to the patchy nature of Rhizoctonia root rot. Wheat cv. Grenade seeds were coated with microbes as a concentrated suspension in a sticker solution (0.3% xanthan gum, 0.05% Na alginate). Seeds were planted with a plot scale seeder and herbicide and fertilisers applied as per local best practice.  Plants (21) from each split--plot were assessed at 8 wks (2013) or 11 wks (2014) and assessed for root disease score (0--5 scale) caused by Rhizoctonia on seminal and nodal roots and for dry weights of roots and shoots. Seeds were harvested at the end of season with a plot scale header. In 2014, Streptomyces strain EN16 and an in--furrow chemical treatment, Uniform (Syngenta) were included as controls.

Pythium irregulare strain 89 was added as one 11 mm agar plug, with no pre--incubation prior to seeding with two pre--germinated wheat cv. Yitpi seeds. For seed inoculation, microbes were harvested from agar plates, diluted to absorbance of 0.8 at 550nm in a dilute sticker solution (0.005% Na alginate, 0.03% xanthan gum) and 150 ul added directly to seeds. Plants were assessed by shoot height and number of roots reaching the bottom of the tube. Two replicates per treatment. Results are shown in Table 12.

Seed coated microbes were assessed at two Pythium infested sited in 2015 and 2016 (Table 17). Plant establishment was increased in both years with microbial inoculation compared to controls, but this was only significantly different at the Conmurra sites. Significant yield responses of 4.6 to 6.3 % increase were evident in 2015 at Turretfield with non-significant increases at Conmurra. Yield responses in 2016 were probably masked by nearly double the rainfall compared to 2015.  Significant reductions in root disease were evident at Turretfield in 2015 and Conmurra in 2016.     Table 17. Results from control of Pythium root rot on wheat field trials.

Yitpi) after inoculation and at 1, 2 and 7 days. Concentrated microbial suspensions were made in a sticker solution (0.3% xanthan gum, 0.05% Na alginate) at various concentrations depending on results of tertiary assays and 626 ul added to each 20 g seed lot and mixed until even coverage of seeds. To assess seed colony forming units (cfu), 5 seeds were placed in 1.5 ml tubes, 1 ml phosphate buffered saline added, vortexed 15 sec and shaken for 15 min on orbital shaker at maximum speed.  The suspension was sampled, serially diluted, plated onto agar media and cfu/seed calculated. There were two replicates for strains 10.6D and HCA1273, three replicates for 9.4E and BD141 at each time point. Percent survival was calculated based on initial population at t=0. Results are shown in Table 18. Table 18-- Log10 cfu/seed and percent survival on seeds at t=0, 1,2, and 7 days after inoculation.

Fungi were grown on PDA/4 for between 2 and 7 d depending on strain prior to use. Test fungal pathogens were added to the centre of 9 cm agar plates as 8 mm agar and test strains added as 2x 20 pl spots (107 cfu/m1) on opposite sides of the plate 30 mm from the centre. Inhibition zones were recorded at 2d for P. irregulare, 4 d for R. solani and 7 d for Ggt and F.  pseudograminearum.  There were three replicate plates for each pathogen-test strain combination in a randomised complete block design. Results are shown in Table 19. Table 19-- In vitro inhibition of root pathogens Rhizoctonia solani AG8, Fusarium pseudograminearum, Pythium irregulare and Gaeumannomyces graminis tritici (Ggt) by strains isolated for Rhizoctonia control. Response of fungal pathogen to test strains are given as: -- no sign of inhibition; +  hyphal avoidance but no clear zone of inhibition; ++ inhibition zone 1-2 mm; +++ inhibition zone >3mm.

Zones of inhibition were measured after 3 days. Results are shown in Table 20. Where a zone of inhibition of greater than 4 mm was observed, this was indicative of an inhibitory effect on the growth of the inoculant.
