Reason is sprayed Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums and is not sprayed, the latter is control.Acquired respectively after 1 month each sample prescription 0-2cm and
2-5cm soil samples carry out microbial populations in soil quantity, soil enzyme activities, the measurement of cryptogam, and each soil sample is all provided with 3 weights
It is multiple. 
 2, experimental result 
 (1) influence that sprinkling Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums are distributed different soil major microorganisms 
 The application of Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums, affects the quantative attribute of the original microbe groups of soil.Control is each
Soil layer, after spraying Oligotrophic bacteria microbial inoculum, all kinds of micro organism quantities have obvious increase.For bacterium, control sample
0-2cm layers of bacterial number is sprayed significantly less than 2-5cm soil layers in the sample ground of Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums, bacterium
The regularity of distribution shows as surface layer and is more than time surface layer, and 0-2cm layers of bacterial number is significantly higher than control.Spray Oligotrophic bacteria
Afterwards, the fungi of each soil layer and Population of Actinomycetes increased.Oligotrophic bacteria in Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums
After DOB150 enters soil, certain facilitation is played to the growth and breeding of other microorganisms, to soil microbial activities
Raising have certain help. 
 (2) influence of the sprinkling Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums to different soil soil enzyme activities 
 It is shown in Table 1, compared with the control, the application of Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 is different to 5 kinds of enzymatic activitys in testing soil
The influence of degree.Improve the catalase and polyphenol oxidase activity of 0-2cm and 2-5cm soil layers.The variation of urease activity
It is in opposite trend in 2 soil layers, shows as upper layer urease activity and increase, and lower layer's activity reduces.The different responses of enzymatic activity
It may be related with the change of soil nutrient. 
 The soil enzyme activities on 1 different experiments sample ground of table 
 
 
 
 (3) influence that sprinkling Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums form biological breadcrust 
 Cyanobacteria is the sociales in algae skinning, and very important effect is played to the early formation and recovery of biological breadcrust.
The study show that being shown in Table 2, after spraying sprinkling Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 microbial inoculums to the areas Luo Sha, cyanobacteria quantity obviously increases (200-
300/g soil), and check plot cyanobacteria is few (10-20/g soil), shows that Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 has and promotes algae skinning shape
At effect, but do not find lichens and moss crust in 2 sample ground. 
 Under 2 different disposal of table in soil main cryptogam monoid variation

 Oligotrophic bacteria Bacillus of the present invention using voluntarily screening separation domestication is can be seen that from above-mentioned evaluation
After sp.DOB150CGMCC NO.11925 are applied to sandy soil, adhesion sand grains, prevention drift sand activation have been not only acted as, moreover it is possible to effectively
Increase major microorganisms quantity in soil, improves essential nutrient contents of soil, strengthening part soil enzyme activities, and can obviously restore
Algae skinning.Therefore, Oligotrophic bacteria DOB150 is a kind of more satisfactory biomaterial that fixes the sand, this is tied effectively to restore biology
Skin, reparation are damaged sand ground and provide new method. 
 The above embodiment is merely an example for clearly illustrating the present invention, and does not limit the embodiments.
For those of ordinary skill in the art, other various forms of variations can also be made on the basis of the above description
Or it changes.There is no necessity and possibility to exhaust all the enbodiments.And the obvious variation thus extended
Or it changes and is still in the protection scope of this invention.
