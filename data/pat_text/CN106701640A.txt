 Technical field 
 The invention mainly relates to microbial engineering field, specifically, the present invention relates to the production bacterium of natural pigment
Strain, pigment and preparation method. 
 
 
 Background technology 
 Pigment is to refer to make the material coloured by mordant dyeing thing, is also colouring agent, can be used to change article or food
Color and luster, is widely used in the industries such as weaving, building, food, biology, medical and health, cosmetics, manufactured goods, feed neck
Domain, pigment is by sources divided into natural pigment and the major class of synthetic dyestuff two. 
 The natural pigment class that natural pigment is extracted in being mainly the root from plant, stem, leaf, flower, fruit and animal, microorganism
Material, is the pigment that people use always before synthetic dyestuff appearance.Compared with synthetic dyestuff, most natural colours
Element has no toxic side effect, and biocompatibility is safe.Although synthetic dyestuff is bright in colour, strong coloring force, stable in properties and cost
It is cheap, but it is that raw material is closed that synthetic dyestuff is mainly the aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene, aniline of extraction from coal tar
Into, there are different degrees of toxicity, particularly azo-type pigment, it is possible to carcinogen is formed by metabolism in vivo,
In synthetic dyestuff building-up process, it is also possible to by heavy metal or other Substances Pollutions.At present, natural pigment turned into food,
The development trend of cosmetics, health products trade. 
 It is red, yellow, blue as three basic pigments, can be collocated with each other and show abundant tone, with high application valency
Value.Uranidin mainly has extraction process and microbe fermentation method to prepare in natural pigment.Mainly there is turmeric by what extraction process was produced
Pigment, lutein, Gardenia Yellow, carthamin yellow etc., this production method is main to be extracted from plant, by seasonal effect compared with
Greatly, and in extracting organic solvent is introduced, relatively costly, Production by Microorganism Fermentation uranidin does not receive seasonal effect, conversion
Rate is higher, and low cost, development prospect is wide, but because microorganism resource is deficient, related report is less, discloses report
Monascus ruber, pseudomonad etc., monascus ruber not only produce uranidin also to produce haematochrome, and better heat stability is natural Huang
The main path that pigment is extracted, fluorescent pseudomonas (Pseudomonas disclosed in patent (publication number CN102899265A)
Fluorescens BGM-1, CGMCC NO.6060) 2%-8% inoculum concentrations extract yellow in 20 DEG C of -28 DEG C of tray cultivation and fermentations
Element, micrococcus luteus disclosed in patent (publication number CN105349466A) (Micrococcus luteus, CGMCC
NO.11518 30 DEG C of pH7.0 culture mediums culture 24h) are inoculated into, thermokalite method can extract uranidin, but the species of these strains
And the need for quantity is far from every profession and trade is met to natural yellow pigment research and development.Therefore, filtering out can largely produce uranidin
Novel microbial strain and there is important scientific research and application value with different qualities uranidin. 
 
 
 The content of the invention 
 Species and quantity for state of the art, particularly strain are ground far from every profession and trade is met to natural yellow pigment
Study carefully the technical problem that exploitation needs, a plant of the application offer is isolated from Xinjiang wood base chick-pea root nodule yellow bacterial strain, is a kind of
Typical novel bacterial, the natural yellow pigment prepared using the strain is had extensive in terms of natural yellow pigment production and research
Application value. 
 To achieve these goals, present invention separation one kind from the chick-pea root nodule of Xinjiang wood base produces natural yellow pigment to produce
Raw bacterium, while there is provided the uranidin that the method and production of extracting uranidin are produced using the strain fermentation, the yellow for being produced
Element has anti-oxidation function；The stabilization in the range of pH2.0~9.0；With preferable heat endurance and certain photostability. 
 The specific a kind of natural yellow pigment producing strains for providing of the invention, through microbial strains taxonomic identification, determine the bacterial strain
It is Bucillus aureus novel species, the numbering of strain is XJ2, it is proposed that Classification And Nomenclature is Chryseobacterium sp (Chryseobacterium

 The uranidin crude preparation that will be obtained is dissolved in 95% ethanol solution, is carried out using ultraviolet specrophotometer
The scanning analysis of 200-800nm, analysis result, referring to Figure of description 3.During analysis result table, Bucillus aureus novel species is golden yellow
The uranidin that bacillus (Chryseobacterium sp.) XJ2 CGMCC No.13157 are produced has the absorption of maximum at 438nm
Peak, illustrates that Bucillus aureus novel species Chryseobacterium sp (Chryseobacterium sp.) can be carried out with the light wave of 438nm wavelength
The assay of XJ2 CGMCC No.13157 uranidin. 
 
 
 Embodiment three：The uranidin that Chryseobacterium sp (Chryseobacterium sp.) XJ2 CGMCC No.13157 are produced
Dissolubility is determined 
 Bucillus aureus novel species Chryseobacterium sp (Chryseobacterium sp.) XJ2 CGMCC No.13157 ferment and
Uranidin crude extract is obtained, 10mL pure water, 50% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 99.8% ethanol are measured respectively, 50% methyl alcohol is molten
Liquid, 100% methyl alcohol, during ethyl acetate, acetone, n-butanol are as colorimetric cylinder, and add definitely excess uranidin crude extract in each
Plant in solvent, sealing produced saturation uranidin solution after shaking table room temperature 100rpm vibrations dissolving 12 hours.Again with 8000rpm,
5min centrifugal treatings, take supernatant and determine light absorption value in 438nm wavelength, and are contrasted with 95% ethanol saturation uranidin solution O D,
Dissolving multiplying power is calculated, 2 are shown in Table. 
 Table 2：Different solutions are to extraction effect
