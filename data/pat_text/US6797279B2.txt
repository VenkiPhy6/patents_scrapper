 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING 
 FIG. 1 is a graph illustrating absorption spectrum of an ether solution used for qualifying carotinoid materials in a sample 1. of a healthy food (TFK-RC) of the present invention. 
 BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION 
 Described below is an embodiment of the present invention. 
 A healthy food (TFK-RC) of the present invention contains a metabolic product of a photosynthetic bacterium that is obtained from a liquid medium prepared by incubating a bacterial solution including a photosynthetic bacterium and preferably a lactic acid bacterium so as to produce in a large quantity a viscous material from the photosynthetic bacterium. In other words, the healthy food is obtained by, for example, filtration of the liquid medium by means of centrifugation, and dehydration of a concentrated biomass, which is a residue including each biomass having the metabolic product of the photosynthetic bacterium excluding filtrate, for example by means of freeze-drying. 
 The thus obtained healthy food (TFK-RC), as explained later, was not toxic, and regular intake of the healthy food (TFK-RC) showed no side effect. Moreover, observed was improvement of health condition of unhealthy people who had ingested 30 mg to 360 mg, more preferably 60 mg to 240 mg of the healthy food (TFK-RC) per day for a period ranging from one week to 6 months for example, where the ingestion was in one time or preferably divided into four times (morning, noon, night and before sleep). The unhealthy people were suffering from, for example: cancer in the final stage, lymphogranuloma, severe diabetes, severe depression, severe cardiac disease, severe skin disease (including atopic dermatitis), impotency, epilepsy, hypertension (including low blood pressure), chronic constipation, chronic diarrhea, insomnia, menstrual pains, acute pneumonia, the autonomic imbalance, cerebral embolism, or polyp of the colon. The ingestion was carried out with consent of the unhealthy people and a medical doctor in charge for the unhealthy person. 
 Because of this, it was deduced that the healthy food (TFK-RC) improves autoimmune of the patients, and it was indicated that there was a possibility that the healthy food (TFK-RC) had efficiency for recovering health condition of the patient who ingested it, even though system of its function was unknown. Moreover, it was indicated the healthy food (TFK-RC) was effective for maintaining the health of a health person who ingested it. 
 The photosynthetic bacterium is, for example, a red non-sulfur bacterium, which is a red photosynthetic bacterium,  Athiorhodaceae rhodopseudomonus,  more preferably,  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas , or especially preferably  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  FERMBP-7434 strain that had been deposited at an international depository Authority for microorganisms. 
 The international depository authority is the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, whose address is 1-3, Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan (Post Code 305-8566). The FERMBP-7434 strain was internationally deposited on Jan. 18, 2001, by requesting to transfer to depository in accordance with the terms of the Budapest Treaty, Bikokenyo No. P-17654, which had been domestically deposited at the international depository authority on Nov. 18, 1999 (original depository date). The name of the depositor is Biochem Industrial Co., Ltd. (representative: Nobuhiro TODA). Address of the depositor is 2-25-D407, 1-chome, Wadayama-dori, Hyogo-ku, Kobe-shi, Hyogo, Japan. 
 The lactic acid bacterium may be  Lactobacillus spp.  or  Streptococcus spp.,  for example. The  Lactobacillus spp.  may be  Lactobacillus bulgalicus  and  Lactobacillus acidophilus , for example. The  Streptococcus spp.  may be  Streptococcus lactis  and  Streptococcus thermophilus , for example. 
 Explained below is incubation condition of the bacterial solution. To begin with, as the incubation condition, the bacteria and a liquid medium (pH 6.0 to pH 8.5) including organic materials, mainly low fatty acids (at least one of a saturated fatty acid and an unsaturated fatty acid), were poured into a transparent growth tank. The incubation was carried out in the growth tank with illumination of light at 3000 lux to 10000 lux, at a temperature ranging from 23° C. to 39° C., and under an anaerobic condition. The incubation reached a stationary phase in 72 hours at latest, so that the concentrated bacteria could be obtained from the liquid medium. The liquid medium contained biotin, thiamin, and niacin as growth factors. 
 The incubation condition is explained below with more details. To begin with, in a mixing tank for nutrition, prepared was a base medium made of a mixture of incubation substances .(NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , KH 2 PO 4 , MgSO 4 . 7H 2 O, NaCl, NaHCO 3 , and yeast extract (including the above mentioned growth factors). In case of the incubation of the non-sulfur bacterium, low fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and lactic acid, which were in a form of Na salt, were added into the base medium, so as to prepare the liquid medium (for example, at pH 7.0). Moreover, in case of the incubation of the red sulfur bacterium, Na 2 S.9H 2 O was added into the base medium and adjusted by using KOH solution so as to prepare a liquid medium (at between pH 8.2 and 8.5). 
 Next, the liquid medium was transferred from the mixing tank for nutrition to a sealed and illuminated growth tank. Then, as the photosynthetic bacterium, for example,  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  FERMBP-7434 strain, which was a red non-sulfur bacterium (Athiorhodaceae), was inoculated into the sealed and illuminated growth tank. 
 In this case, human waste or waste liquid of shochu (Japanese distilled white liquor), in which organic acids had been generated, might be poured directly into the sealed and illuminated growth tank, instead of the liquid medium. Note that, the photosynthetic bacterium of this type also metabolizes starch, glucose, sucrose, alcohol, and other high molecular carbohydrates, thereby growing well, if various heterotrophic bacteria coexist, besides the organic acids that form the liquid medium. Because of this, it is more effective to inoculate, in the sealed and illuminated growth tank, various heterotrophic bacteria, such as the above-mentioned lactic acid bacteria, together with the photosynthetic bacterium, while adding those high molecular carbohydrates into the liquid medium. In addition, hydrogen gas generated during the incubation of the photosynthetic bacterium can be stored in a tank so as to be used as a fuel. 
 Consequently, the bacterial solution which had been incubated to an optimum level in the sealed and illuminated growth tank, was converted into the concentrated biomass by gathering the bacteria by means of a continuous centrifugal separator. Thereafter, the concentrated biomass was freeze-dried so as to obtain a dehydrated biomass. In the above process, when the incubated bacterial solution is transferred into the continuous centrifugal separator, it is possible to continuously obtain the identical photosynthetic bacterium, when, for example, 20% of the whole solution is always left in the growth tank so that the liquid medium prepared in the mixing tank for nutrition is added to the 20% of the liquid medium. 
 Note that, the reason why the sealed and illuminated growth tank was used in this method was because the photosynthetic bacterium grows optimally in the anaerobic atmosphere and under the illuminated condition (between 3000 lux and 10000 lux). Moreover, a stirring apparatus for stirring the liquid medium may be provided in the sealed and illuminated growth tank. The provision of the stirring apparatus can improve growth speed of the bacteria. 
 EXAMPLE 
 Described below is an example of the incubation of the photosynthetic bacterium. To begin with, in the mixing tank for nutrition, added into water of 1×10 3  cm 3  (1 liter) were: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
   
 (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4   
  0.3 g

  0.5 g 
 
 
   
 MgSO 4 .7H 2 O 
  0.2 g 
 
 
   
 NaCl 
  0.5 g 
 
 
   
 NaHCO 3   
  0.2 g 
 
 
   
 Yeast Extract 
 0.01 g 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 The respective above-listed nutrition were mixed into the water to prepare the base medium. Further, acetic acid 0.4 weight %, in the form of Na salt, and sucrose 5 weight % were added into the base medium, which was further adjusted to pH 7.0, for example, to prepare the liquid medium. Then, the liquid medium was transferred into the sealed and illuminated growth tank. 
 The growth tank, made of a transparent material, such as glass, in a cylinder-like shape, was illuminated by fluorescent lamps arranged in periphery of the growth tank at regular interval so as to illuminate evenly an inside of the growth tank. Meanwhile, the growth tank was provided with a stirring device that has blades of a size of a radius of the growth tank, in the growth tank. Therefore, the growth tank was capable of incubating the photosynthetic bacterium in a large quantity and with ease in the anaerobic atmosphere. 
 Next, a solution (bacterial concentration 10 6  cell/cm 3 ) of  Rhodopseudomonus capsulatas  FERMBP-7434 strain was inoculated in a 20% ratio (v/v) over the total of the solution in the growth tank, then, a small quantity of a lactic acid bacterium ( Lactobacillus bulgalicus , bacterial concentration 10 6  cell/cm 3 ) was inoculated. The liquid medium was stirred at a rotation speed 13 times per minute at an incubation temperature 30° C. under illumination of 10000 lux. After 8 hours, the growth of the photosynthetic bacterium attained its optimum (stationary phase). Here, in the growth tank, a large quantity of the viscous material had been produced, while the photosynthetic bacterium was grown. 
 This liquid medium was transferred into a continuous centrifugal separator (sharp less type) so as to gather and concentrate the bacteria. The concentrated biomass was subjected to the freeze-drying, so that the biomass was obtained. The thus obtained biomass could be inoculated and obtained in a ratio of about 5 g per 1×10 3  (1 liter) of the liquid medium. As discussed later, the thus obtained biomass was quite active. 
 In the following, explained is a process of the freeze-drying. To begin with, the thus obtained concentrated biomass (about 10 11  cell/cm 3 ) was freezed to store in a freezer, once. At the time of the freeze-drying, for example, 4×10 3  cm 3  (4 liter) was naturally thawed (about 12 hours), then poured and divided into 9 sucking bottles for 1.2×10 3  cm 3 , approximately evenly (about 440 cm 3  each bottle) 
 Consequently, in a preliminary freezing tank (−45° C.), which had been filled in advance with an anti-freezing solution such as methanol, a bottom of the sucking bottles was touched with the anti-freezing solution by means of a prefreezer, while the sucking bottles were rotated, so that the concentrated biomass in the sucking bottle was freezed again so as to form a thin film along an inner wall of the sucking bottle (it was arranged that a thickness of the freezed biomass in the sucking bottle was about 8 mm, and the freezing time was about 20 minutes). The freezed concentrated biomass was stored in the freezer until the freezing of all the 9 bottles were completed. 
 After that, an inside of a trap of a freeze-drier was cooled down (−45° C.). After one hour since then (that is, when the cooling in the trap was completed), a vacuum pump was operated. After it was confirmed that a vacuum gauge of the vacuum pump was lowered below 26 Pa, preferably 4 to 6 Pa, the respective sucking bottles were connected with the trap. Consequently, the respective sucking bottles and the vacuum pump were linked via the trap. Then, the drying of the freezed biomass inside the respective sucking bottles was started at a room temperature (20° C. to 30° C.). The drying time, while the drying time depends on the room temperature, was about 40 hours. Note that, even though the above example used the freeze-drying method as the drying method of the concentrated biomass, it was also possible to use spray-drying as another drying method. 
 The thus obtained dried biomass was milled, for example, by using a crushing apparatus of a propeller-type (sample mill), where the rotation of the propellers was about 15000 rpm, so as to powder the dried biomass. Other powdering methods were, for example, a jet mill method or a ball mill method. 
 The powdered dried biomass may be used as the healthy food (TFK-RC) as it stands. Alternatively, the powdered dried biomass may be processed into a form of a tablet for a sake of easy ingestion. For example, a tablet-making machine of a high speed rotation type may be used for making the tablet. At the time of the tablet making process, it is possible to make the tablet without using an excipient, such as lactose, a binder, and a releasing agent such as magnesium stearate. Note that, if necessary, it may be possible to use an excipient for adjusting a dose. 
 In the above, explained was the example where  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  FERMBP-7434 strain was used. However, it may be possible to use other photosynthetic bacteria, such as Chromatium vinosum in a Thiorhodaceae family, or  Rhodospirillum Rubrum  in an Athiorhodaceae family. 
 Each quantification method for bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid materials in the healthy food (TKF-RC) were carried out, based on “photosynthetic researching method” (by Sakae Kato, Kyoritsu Publishing Company: 1981). 
 Described below is the qualification method for the bacteriochlorophyll. To begin with, about 10 mg of a sample of the dried healthy food (TFK-RC) was taken and measured, and suspended in a physiological saline solution, 100 mm 3  (μl). Further, 4.9 cm 3  of acetone: methanol [7:2 (v/v)] was added. Then, the bacteriochlorophyll was extracted. Then, the extract was appropriately diluted Absorbancy of the diluted solution at 770 nm was measured. A concentration of the bacteriochlorophyll was calculated out by the following equation (1): 
 
 
 Bacteriochlorophyll (μg/cm 3 )=12.15 A 770   (1)  
 
 
 In the following, 5 lots of samples 1. through 5. of the bacteriochlorophyll of the present healthy food (TFK-RC), which was manufactured by the above method, were quantified, respectively. A result of the quantification is presented in Table 1.

 Note that, the absorbancy (770 nm) indicated by A 770  in Table 1 is a conversion value to an extracted stock solution (5 cm 3 ). The result showed that the contents (weight %) of the bacteriochlorophyll in the healthy food (TFK-RC) were between 0.2 and 3.0, preferably, between 0.6 and 1.9. 
 In addition, because the measurement of the absorbancy was carried out at 770 nm (red region) in the quantification of the bacteriochlorophyll, it was noted that the measurement result of the bacteriochlorophyll was not affected at all, even if the carotinoid materials were contained in the diluted solution. 
 Next, the quantification method of the carotinoid materials is explained. To begin with, about 10 mg of a sample of the dried healthy food was taken and measured, and was suspended in methanol, boiled to extract for one minute, and cooled down by ice. A supernatant was recovered by means of centrifugal separation. A precipitate was again suspended in the methanol. The extraction was repeated until a colorless extract was obtained, for example, for three times. 
 Ether in an equal quantity, and water in a double quantity with respect to the methanol extract were added into the methanol extract, and ether extraction was carried out. Then, an ether solution, which was separated out, was dehydrated. The thus obtained ether solution was measured to make 6 cm 3  of the ether solution. Then, absorption spectrum of the ether solution was measured. 
 An absorption maximum wavelength within a range from 400 to 550 nm of the absorption spectrum was determined, and absorbancy at the absorption maximum wavelength was measured. Using the absorbancy, the contents of the carotinoid materials were calculated out by the following equation (2): 
 
 
   c=D.v/ 1.4×10 5   (2)  
 
 
 c: content of carotinoid material (mol), 
 D: absorbancy at the absorption maximum wavelength, 
 v: volume of ether solution (10 3  cm 3 , that is, one liter), 
 1.4×10 5 : an average molecular absorption coefficient of carotinoid material. 
 Because the maximum absorption of the carotinoid materials exists within the range from 400 to 550 nm, the absorption maximum wavelength within the range was measured from the absorption spectrum (see FIG. 1) of the ether solution. The carotinoid materials were quantified, based on the absorbancy at the absorption maximum wavelength. 
 Shown below in Table 2, are each quantification result of the carotinoid material as to the respective samples 1. to 5. discussed above. Moreover, absorption spectrum of the sample 1. is illustrated in FIG.  1 . Absorption spectrums of the other samples 2. to 5. also showed a same pattern. 
 The result in Table 2 explains that contents (μmol/g) of the carotinoid materials in the healthy food (TFK-RC) were between 0.5 and 7.5, preferably between 2.4 and 4.0.

 Moreover, according to the result in Table 1, since no absorbancy was measured above 600 nm in a visible region, it was found out that, at most, less than a quantity of a detection limit of the bacteriochlorophyll was contained in the ether extract. Therefore, as to the quantification method of the carotinoid materials, it was found out that the quantification of the carotinoid materials was not affected at all, even though the bacteriochlorophyll was contained in the healthy food (TFK-RC). 
 Next, as to the respective samples 1. to 5. of the healthy food, and water-washed samples of the samples 1. to 5., were respectively subjected to acid hydrolysis, and then quantified in terms of the following respective neutral monosaccharides, by means of a high performance liquid chromatographic method. 
 The quantification method is described below. To begin with, as to preparation of the water-washed samples, about 0.5 g of each sample was weighed and placed in a centrifugal tube. 25 cm 3  of water was added into the centrifugal tube and stirred, then, was subjected to ultrasonic extraction for 3 minutes, then was subjected to centrifugal separation (12,000 rpm, 5 minutes) so as to remove a supernatant. 25 cm 3  of water was added into a reside in the centrifugal tube and the water-washing process was processed again for two times in the same manner. 
 The reside, to which 25 cm 3  of Acetone was added in order to remove water, was stirred, then was subjected to centrifugal separation (12,000 rpm, 5 minutes) so as to remove a supernatant. After acetone remained in the centrifugal tube was volatilized under a nitrogen stream, the reside was air-dried to be the water-washed sample. 
 Next, explained is preparation of a test solution. To begin with, after 0.3 g to 0.6 g of each sample or 0.3 g to 0.6 g of each water-washed sample were weighed, 4 cm 3  of 72% sulfuric acid was added to the samples and the water-washed samples. Then, the samples were stirred for one hour at a room temperature (the water-washed samples were stirred for two hours). 
 Consequently, the samples and the water-washed samples were diluted with 112 cm 3  of water (sulfuric acid concentration: 4%), and were subjected to hydrolysis for one hour in an autoclave (121° C.). After the samples and the water-washed samples were cooled down to the room temperature, and neutralized by a sodium hydroxide solution of 30 w/v %, their volumes were adjusted to 200 cm 3  with water. Then, the samples and water-washed samples were filtered (No. 5B, supplied from Advantech Toyo Co., Ltd.), and further filtered with a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 0.45 μm, thereby obtaining a filtrate as the test solution. 
 The contents of monosaccharides (glucose, ribose, rhamnose, and fucose) were measured by the liquid chromatographic method. A result of the measurement is shown in Table 3. The measurement result indicates the contents (g) per 100 g of the healthy food (TFK-RC).

 In Table 3, ND indicates that the content was less than the detection limit (0.2 g/100 g). 
 According to the result in Table 3, it was found out that, in the acid hydrolyzed samples of the healthy food (TFK-RC) before washing, the contents (weight %) of glucose were in a range between 2.4 and 7.5, more preferably between 3.5 and 6.5, the contents (weight %) of ribose were in a range between 0.3 and 1.1, more preferably between 0.4 and 1.0, the contents (weight %) of rhamnose were in a range between 1.0 and 3.3, more preferably between 1.2 and 3.0, the contents (weight %) of fucose were in a range between 0.6 and 2.6, more preferably 0.8 and 2.4. 
 Moreover, according to the result in Table 3, it was found out that, in the acid hydrolyzed sample of the healthy food (TFK-RC) after washing, the contents (weight %) of glucose were in a range between 0.8 and 3.3, more preferably between 1.0 and 3.0, the contents (weight %) of ribose were in a range between 0.2 and 1.0, more preferably between 0.3 and 0.9, the contents (weight %) of rhamnose were in a range between 0.4 and 2.0, more preferably between 0.5 and 1.6, the contents (weight %) of fucose were less than 0.6, more preferably less than 0.5. 
 Next, as to the healthy food (TFK-RC) of the present invention, an acute oral toxicity test (limit test) was carried out. In short, the acute oral toxicity test (limit test) as to samples of the healthy food (TFK-RC) was carried out by using mice, in accordance with OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) chemical substance test guide (1987). 
 A test group of male and female mice was subjected to single-time oral administration of 2,000 mg/kg of the sample, while a control group of them was orally given purified water, as a control solvent, one time. As a result, no abnormality or expiry of the tested animals was observed. Therefore, it was judged that an LD 50  value of the single-time oral administration as to the tested mice was more than or equal to 2,000 mg/kg for both the male and the female mice. 
 The test is explained below. To begin with, the sample of the healthy food (TFK-RC) was suspended in purified water to prepare 100 mg/cm 3  of a test solution. 
 The tested animal was as follows. To being with, ICR-type male and female mice of 4 week old were purchased from Japan SLC Co., Ltd. After the mice were preliminarily kept for about one week for checking their general condition was not abnormal, the mice were used for the test. The tested animals were put in cages made of polycarbonate, which respectively contained 5 of the tested animals, and were kept in a breeding room in which a room temperature was set at 23±2° C. and illumination time was set at 12 hours per day. Feed (solid feed for mice and rats; lab MR stock, made by Japan agricultural products industry Co., Ltd.) and drinking water (tap water) were freely given. 
 The testing method was as follows. To begin with, both the tested group and the control group had 10 of the male and the female mice, respectively. Before the administration, the tested animals were fasted for about 4 hours. After their body weight was measured, the tested group, both the males and the females, was subjected to a forcible single-time oral administration of the test solution whose dosage, a sample administration amount, was 2,000 mg/kg, by using a stomach sonde. As to the control group, 0.6 cm 3  of the purified water was administered to the males, and 0.5 cm 3  of the purified water was administered to the females, in the same manner. 
 The observation period was 14 days. Observation was carried out frequently on the day of the administration. The observation was carried out once a day from the following day. On 7 days and 14 days since the administration, the body weight was measured, and a comparison between the groups was carried out by t-inspection with a 5% level of significance. At an end of the observation period, all the tested animals were anatomized. A result of the test was as shown in Table 4. In parentheses in Table 4, shown is a number of the animals.

 In the above test, no expiry was observed for both the males and the females during the observation period. No abnormality was observed for both the males and the females during the observation period. As to the body weight measurement on 7 days and 14 days since the administration, no difference between the groups in terms of weight gain was observed as for both the males and the females, as shown in Table 4. In the anatomy after the observation period, no abnormality was found in main internal organs of all the tested animals for both the males and the females. 
 According to the OECD chemical substance test guide (1987), it is instructed that an intensive test for determining an LD 50  value is necessary in case expiry is observed with dosage of 2000 mg/kg. 
 However, in the above test result, no expiry was observed with this dosage, and no abnormality was found at the anatomy, too. Therefore, it was judged that the LD 50  value of the single-time oral administration to the tested mice was more than or equal to 2000 mg/kg for both the males and the females. 
 Because of this, it was proved that the healthy food (TKF-RC) of the present invention does not adversely affect a human body even in case of regular intake of the healthy food (TKF-RC). 
 In the following, morphological characteristics, growth conditions, and physiological characteristics of  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  are described. 
 a. Morphological Characteristics 
   Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  has a flagellum and is quite motile. Generally, they are short bacilli (width 0.5μ×length 1.0μ), while some are long bacilli (width 0.5μ to 0.7μ×length 6.0μ), depending on a type of liquid media and incubation periods. In other words, they shows polymorphism. 
 b. Growth Conditions 
 The growth result (anaerobic and under illumination) on various media are described below.
