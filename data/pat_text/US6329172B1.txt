 The present invention relates to ABC transporter gene cluster, tliDEF, in Pseudomonas fluorescens(“ P. fluorescens” ), more specifically, to ABC transporter gene of  P. fluorescens  encoding proteins which enhance the secretion of foreign proteins extracellularly, a recombinant expression vector containing the transporter gene, a microorganism transformed therewith and a process for preparing foreign proteins which comprises the steps of incubating the transformant, inducing expression of the proteins and leading the proteins to be secreted extracellularly. 
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
 For the last scores of years, various genes from microorganism to human have been isolated and sequenced. In line with the development of biotechnology, foreign proteins have been produced by expressing these genes in host organism such as animal, plant, microorganism, etc. and used it various fields of medicaments, enzymes for biochemical synthesis, food additives and agriculture. 
   Escherichia coli (“ E. coli” ), a representative host organism used for introducing gene, has been employed as a research tool for a long time, since it has been throughly investigated to use conveniently. Further many  E. coli  strains for various purposes have been developed so far, which accelerate the use of  E. coli  for the production of useful proteins necessary for industrial purposes and research purposes as well.  E coli  has an advantage of excessive production of desired protein, since it accumulates foreign gene-derived proteins in a level of 20-50% of total proteins. However, there are many cases that proteins are produced not as an active form but as an inactive inclusion body. Production of inclusion body occurred when proteins can not be secreted extracellularly and then excess amount of proteins accumulated in the cell. These proteins are accumulated as an inclusion body before they were refolded to have a biological activity(see: Mitraki et al., Bio/Technology, 7:693(1989)). Many attempts have been made to solve these problems, for examples, change of fermentation condition(see: Schein, Bio/Technology, 7.1141(1989)) or insertion of chaperon preventing inclusion body from being produced(see: Hockney, Trends Biotechnol., 12:456(1994)). 
 As an alternative approach, a method for secreting intracellular protein to extracellular medium has been investigated. If tale expressed proteins are secreted extracellularly before the accumulation in the cell, inclusion body is not formed any more. Expressed proteins can be ideally manufactured from microorganism by secreting the proteins in the cell, removing the microorganism from culture media, and obtaining the desired proteins from the media. If the expressed proteins are not secreted to extracellular media, inactive inclusion body is formed, or if the inclusion body is not formed, mechanical, chemical and biochemical methods are required to lyse cells and desired proteins should be purified from many other proteins contained in the cell. This accompanies great loss of expense and loss of proteins. Accordingly, it is of great importance to improve is method for secreting proteins expressed in microorganism to extracellular medium. 
 In an association with protein secretion, general export pathway(GEP) has been extensively studied, by which N-terminal sequence of protein is recognized by sec protein in the cell to secrete the protein extracellularly(see: Pugsley, Microbiol. Rev., 57:50(1993)) The industrial use of GEP has been considered, since GEP can lead intracellular proteins to attach to cell surface or to be secreted extracellularly(see: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,156,959; 5,541,087; 5,658,755; and, 5,665,590). By way of GEP, protein is secreted extracellularly in case of Gram-positive bacteria having only one cell membrane, however, it should pass inner membrane, stay at periplasm and bypass outer membrane in case of Gram-negative bacteria like  E. coli  having two cell membranes. Many proteins(≧14) are involved in the export through only outer membrane, which in turn, reveals a serious problem that secretion efficiency is relatively low(see: Akrim et al., Mol. Microbiol., 10:431(1993); Pugsley and Possot, Mol. Microbiol., 10:665(1993)). 
 Another pathway, mediated by ABC transporter(ATP binding cassette transporter), has been also known in the art, where ATP is hydrolyzed to secrete protein(see: Fath and Kolter, Microbiol. Rev., 57:995(1993)). Protein thus secreted has a C-terminal targeting signal, which is recognized by ABC transporter, to secret the protein extracellularly. Protein secretion is carried out by the aid of ABC transporter protein located at cell membrane and proteins of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative. bacteria can pass cell membrane at once. That is, in case of Gram-negative bacteria, secretory protein makes inner membrane fuse partly with outer membrane, which allows the protein to pass 2 membranes at the same time. Accordingly, the secretion pathway based on ABC transporter is more efficient in Gram-negative bacteria such as  E. coli.    
 Until now, many ABC transporters have been successively known in the art, those associated with cyclolysin(see: Glaser et al., EMBO J., 7:3997(1988)), leucotoxin(see: Highlander et al., DNA, 8:15(1989)), protease and lipase, since a secretion system associated with α-hemolysin(see: Felmlee et al., J. Bacteriol., 163:94(1985)) was discovered in  E. coli . Especially, ABC transporter secreting α-hemolysin has been extensively studied and it is proposed as a universal secretory system, based on the results that other proteins can be secreted by C-terminal targeting signal(see: Blight and Holland, Trends Biotechnol., 12:450(1994) In this connection, ABC transporters cloned from Pseudomonas sp., Erwinia sp. and Serratia sp., are practically applied for the secretion of protease extracellularly(see: Duong et al., Gene, 121:47(1992); Letoffe et al., EMBO J., 9:1375(1990); Letoffe et al., T. Bacterol., 173:2160(1991)). However, little attraction has been, paid to ABC transporter for secreting lipase. 
 So far, two kinds of ABC transporters secreting, lipase extracellularly have been reported in the art: First, a gene secreting lipase was cloned from  Serratia marcescens (see: Akatsuka et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:6381(1995)); second, ABC transporter secreting protease from  P. aeruginosa  was revealed to secrete lipase of  P. fluorescens (see: Duong et al., Mol. Microbiol., 11; 1117(1994)). Naturally, ABC transporter has not been practically applied in industry since only the ABC transporters from  Serratia marcescens  and protease from  P. fluorescens  are available to secrete lipase. In addition, ABC transporter for lipase secretion has not been found in  P. fluorescens , though the lipase from the microorganism was cloned in many research groups(see: Lee et al, Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1169:156(1993); Tan et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 58:1402(1992); John et al., Appl. Environ Microbiol., 58:1776(1992)). 
 Accordinqly, there are strong reasons for exploring ABC transporter gene from  P. fluorescens , and to develop a novel process for preparing foreign proteins by ABC transporter in a simple and efficient manner. 
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
 The present inventors first cloned a gene encoding ABC transporter from  P. fluorescens , and constructed an expression vector containing the said gene and lipase or protease coding gene which can be expressed in Gram-negative bacteria such as  E. coli  and Pseudomonas sp., to secrete the lipase or protease proteins. As a result, it was found that these proteins can be produced and accumulated in extracellular medium with a high efficiency. Since the ABC transporter enhancing the secretion of foreign proteins functions at a low temperature of below 25° C., it can prevent inclusion body formation, which allows universal use of the ABC transporter for industrial purposes. 
 The first object of the invention is, therefore, to provide ABC transporter gene from  P. fluoresens  which enhances the secretion of foreign proteins to extracellular medium. 
 The second object of the invention is to provide an expression vector containing the ABC transporter gene which is designed to secrete foreign proteins extracellularly. 
 The third object of the invention is to provide recombinant expression vectors which are constructed to express and secrete foreign proteins extracellularly by ABC transporter. 
 The fourth object of the invention is to provide a transformant harboring the ABC transporter expression vector. 
 The fifth object of the invention is to provide a process for preparing foreign proteins by secreting the proteins expressed in the transformant extracellularly by ABC transporter.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
 In describing the present invention, the term ABC transporter gene′ is employed to mean a gene encoding ABC transporter which promotes secretion of foreign proteins expressed in a microorganism extracellularly. ABC transporter gene from  P. fluorescens  is further illustrated in detail. 
 ABC transporter gene of the present invention was cloned from total DNA of  P. fluorescens . The ABC transporter gene can be cloned in  P. fluorescens  SIK W1(KCTC 2689P),  P. fluorescens  B52,  P. fluorescens  LS107d2,  P. fluorescens ( Serratia marcescens  Sr41) or  P. fluorescens  FT(JP 1997224679-A 1 Sep. 02, 1997) which produce lipase or protease. 
 Plasmid vectors which are replicable in transformants and have resistance to antibiotics such as (ampiciIin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin or tetracycline, and have promoter such as lac, tac, trp or PCm, can be used to clone the ABC transporter gene. Among these vectors, pUC18, pUC19(see; Yanisch-Perron et al., Gene, 33:103(1985)) or pBluescript(Stratagene, USA) may be used as high-copy-number plasmids, and pBR322(see: Rodriguez et al., Gene, 2:95(1977)), or pACYC184(see: Chang and Cohen, J. Bacteriol., 134:1141(1978)) may be used as low-copy number plasmids. Since the origin of replication of pUC18, pUC19 or pBluescript is different from pACYC184, replication and maintenance of high-copy-number plasmids are possible when these plasmids are introduced into microorganism with pACYC184. 
   E. coli  can be usually used as a host for recombination of the plasmid vectors and analysis of DNA sequence as well, inter alia,  E. coli  XL1-Blue, JM109 and DH5 which are widely distributed and commercially available, are preferred. These  E. coli  can be used to express interested genes, and Pseudomonas sp. Such as  P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. aeruginosa  and  P. fragi  can be also used for the same purpose. According to the present invention, a gene encoding lipase was first screened to clone ABC transporter gene, since the ABC transporter gene is frequently located adjacent to the genes encoding secretory proteins: Total DNA of  P. fluorescens  was digested with restriction enzymes, and DNAs of proper size was collected and inserted into vector to construct genomic library for cloning of lipase gene. If the genomic library is spread on a medium confirming lipase activity, like LAT media containing LB, tributyrin and ampicilin, active halos appear in  E. coli  with lipase gene. Consequently, lipase gene can be selected. After cloning of lipase gene, upstream and downstream DNA sequence of lipase gene was analyzed to confirm whether ABC transporter gene was contained or not. 
 If the ABC transporter gene had existed, it was investigated whether all components of ABC transporter gene are contained or not. If ABC transporter gene cluster had not been contained in cloned vector, other components were selected by Southern hybridization: Total DNA was digested with EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI, KpnI, SalI, SacI, etc., electrophoresed, and hybridized band was eluted with probe homologous to a part of ABC transporter gene. The extract was inserted into a vector, introduced into  E. coli  and colony hybridization was performed to screen  E. coil  harboring recombinant vector containing desired gene. Recombinant vector containing the other region of ABC transporter gene was obtained by isolating vector from  E. coli  selected by colony hybridization. ABC transporter gene(tliDEF), protease, protease inhibitor and lipase gene(tliA) were cloned from  P. fluorescens . ABC transporter gene was a double helix DNA of 4540 bp long composed of 3 open reading frame(ORF), and protease, protease inhibitor and lipase gene of  P. fluorescens  was located upstream and downstream of ABC transporter gene, respectively. 
 After cloning of ABC transporter gene as described aboves, a transformant which secretes foreign protein to extracellular medium was constructed by introducing both foreign protein encoding gene and tliDEF into Gram-negative bacteria such as  E. coli  and Pseudomonas sp. Two kinds of transformants may be constructed as follows: The first one is constructed by transforming with one expression vector containing genes encoding foreign protein and ABC transporter gene, and the other one is constructed by transforming with two different recombinant expression vectors containing the said genes in a separate manner. 
 In the former case, it has an advantage of using an antibiotic to maintain expression vector. However, the expression of foreign protein gene and ABC transporter gene can not be controlled independently, since the said two genes are regulated by one promoter. In the latter case, though the expression of each recombinant vector can be regulated independently, two antibiotics are essentially required. Since ABC transporter should be located in cell membrane to secrete foreign proteins to extracellular medium, expression and secretion can be maximized effectively if the expression of ABC transporter gene is carried out constitutively and the expression of foreign protein gene is induced at the initial stage of log phase. In accordance with the present invention, a recombinant vector pABC-ACYC containing ABC transporter gene of  P. fluorescens , pHOPE containing lipase gene, and pPROT705 containing protease gene were constructed, respectively, and found that lipase or protease was secreted extracellularly by transforming a microorganism with two recombinant expression vectors. A transformant was constructed by transforming  E. coli  XL1-Blue with ABC transporter-expressing vector of pABC-ACYC. The transformed  E. coli  was named  Escherichia coli  XL1-Blue/pABC-ACYC′, and deposited with the Korean Collection for Type Cultures(KCTC, #52, Oun-dong, Yusong-ku, Taejon 305-333, Republic of Korea) an international depository authority, on Mar. 9, 1999 as accession numbers of KCTC 0586BP. 
 Incubation is carried out at below 27° C., preferably 15-27° C., more preferably 18-25° C. Expression vector containing foreign protein gene was introduced into  E. Coli  or Pseudomonas and incubated at low temperature, since ABC transporter gene of  P. fluorescens  functions at low temperature and secrete foreign proteins optimally. Moreover, incubation at low temperature prevents the formation of inclusion body and induces the production and secretion of foreign proteins. This system has an advantage of producing foreign protein with high efficiency, by introducing expression vector into low temperature-resistant microorganism such as  P. fluorescens . Further, high expression of foreign protein or ABC transporter can be realized by adding an inducer of IPTG when the recombinant microorganism containing induction vector reached log phase. 
 Proteins may be isolated from medium by saltinq out employing highly concentrated salt solution or detergents, use of ion chromatography, protein precipitator or combination thereof. Lipase isolated from nutrient broth may be used immediately after centrifugation, or concentrated through ultrafiltration, lyophilized and solidified. Lipase of  P. fluorescens  can be easily isolated by inactivating other proteins at a high temperature since it is resistant to heat treatment. 
 The present invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention. In particular, the ABC transporter gene of the invention covers a DNA sequence from  P. fluorescens  disclosed herein and its functional equivalents as well which are prepared by insertion mutation, chemical mutation, random mutation, or PCR technique aided mutation. 
 EXAMPLE 1 
 Cloning of ABC Transporter Gene 
 EXAMPLE 1—1: 
 Isolation of Total DNA Containing Lipase and ABC Transporter Genes 
 In order to screen ABC transporter gene, total DNA was isolated from  P. fluorescens  as follows: 100 ml of nutrient broth was inoculated with  P. fluorescens  SIK W1 (KCTC 2689P) and incubated at 25° C. for about 24 hours. The culture was centrifuged, and suspended with 15 ml of saline-EDTA buffer(containing 0.15M NaCl and 0.1M EDTA). After incubating at 37° C. for 30 minutes with 3 mg lysozyme, cells were shaked vigorously and lysed by adding 0.2 ml of 25% SDS(sodium dodecylsulfate). Foreign proteins and impurities were extracted 5 times with 10 mM Tris-buffered phenol and extracted 2 times with phenol-chloroform(1:1, v/v) solution. DNA was collected by swirling glass rod after adding 1/10(v/v) of 3M sodium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol to the resultant solution. Total DNA was washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in TE buffer(10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). 
 EXAMPLE 1-2 
 Cloning of Lipase Gene 
 Since the ABC transporter gene is frequently located adjacent to the genes encoding secreted proteins in DNA of microorganism, a gene encoding lipase, to clone ABC transporter gene, was screened as follows: Total DNA collected in Example 1-1 was partially digested with restriction enzyme Sau3AI, and the fragments of about 4 to 20 kb were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. This DNA fragments are digested with BamHI and ligated to pUC19 vector dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Recombinant plasmids containing various DNA fragments were used to transform  E. Coli  and genomic library was constructed. Genomic library thus constructed was screened by plating on LAT medium which is used to measure lipase activity, and 12 colonies showing lipase activity were selected. Since clear halo may appear on the LAT plate by the activity of esterase, 12 colonies were placed on ROM plate(nutrient broth, 0.001% Rhodamin-B, 1.0% olive oil and 1.5% agar) to confirm lipase activity, and only one out of the 12 colonies was revealed to possess lipase activity. Recombinant vector isolated from this colony confirmed that 10.2 kb DNA was inserted into the vector and a gene encoding lipase was located in the middle of inserted DNA. This recombinant vector was named ‘pJH9’ (sec: FIG.  1 ). 
 EXAMPLE 1-3 
 Cloning of ABC Transporter Gene for Lipase Secretion 
 Upstream and downstream of lipase gene in pJH9 was sequenced and it was determined that: though the ABC transporter gene secreting lipase was located upstream region, only some components of the ABC transporter gene were contained in pJH9. Therefore, Southern hybridization was carried out to find other component of the ABC transporter gene: Total DNA of  P. fluorescens  obtained in Example 1—1 was digested with HindIII, BamHI, and KpnI, respectively, and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblot. Probe homologous to 1.3 kb fragment produced by HindIII-BamHI digestion of pJH9 was synthesized, and hybridized with nitrocellulose membrane. As a result, hybridized bands were detected in HindIII- and BamHI-digested chromosomal DNA among DNA of  P. fluorescens (≧13 kb for HindIII, 4.5 kb for BamHI). The 4.5 kb BamHI DNA fragments were eluted and ligated into BamHI-digested pUC19, and the cloned plasmid were transformed into  E. coli , and plated on LB plate, then colony hybridization was performed to select transformant containing ABC transporter gene, and 2 colonies containing the same plasmids were finally selected. Cleavage map of insert revealed that 3′ region of the insert was overlapped with the 5′ region of the insert in pJH9. This recombinant vector was named ‘pSCRAP’ (see: FIG.  1 ). 
 EXAMPLE 2 
 Analysis of Cloned Gene 
 To analyze DNA sequence of cloned recombinant vectors(i.e., pJH9 and pSCRAP), the vectors were digested with various restriction enzymes on the basis of cleavage map of 2 vectors, and the fragments were subcloned into M13mp18 and M13mp19. DNA sequence was analyzed with ABI PRISM BigDye primer cycle-sequencing kit(Perkin-Elmer, USA) by using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, where synthetic nucleotides were also employed for sequencing each side of 2 strands of DNA. Analysis of 8.5 kb DNA revealed that this DNA contained 6 open rending frames and 3 among them were associated with lipase ABC transporter gene. Genes encoding protease and protease inhibitor, and gene encoding lipase were located upstream and downstream of ABC transporter gene, respectively(see, SEQ ID NO:1). DNA sequence of 8580 bp containing these 6 genes was shown in SEQ ID NO:1, where 292-1725 bp is a region of gene encoding protease PrtA (see: SEQ ID NO:2), 1775-2143 bp, protease inhibitor Inh (see: SEQ ID NO:3), 2215-3951 bp, ABC transporter TliD (see: SEQ ID NO:4), 3992-5293 bp, ABC transporter TliE (see: SEQ ID NO:5), 5296-6741 bp, ABC transporter TliF (see: SEQ ID NO:6) and 6788-8218 bp, thermostable lipase TliA(see: SEQ ID NO:7). From the analysis of DNA sequence, it was found that promoter is located upstream of the ABC transporter gene and transcription terminator is located downstream of lipase gene, which indicates that lipase and ABC transporter genes constitute an operon to produce proteins translated from the same RNA. 
 EXAMPLE 3 
 Construction of Transformant Secreting Lipase 
 A 2.9 kb HindIII-EcoRI-digested fragment containing lipase gene from pJH9 was inserted into pUC19 and named pHOPE′ (see: FIG.  1 ). When this cloned plasmid was expressed in  E. coli  transformed therewith as a control, most of lipase existed in the cell and very small amount of lipase was produced extracellularly(≦1 U/ml). Accordingly, a recombinant vector containing ABC transporter gene was constructed to secrete lipase extracellularly: First of all, 2.3 kb BsrBI-BamHI-digested fragment was isolated from pSCRAP, and ligated into EcoRV/BamHl site of pACYC184 vector to constitute a recombinant vector pBsB-ACYC containing a gene encoding ABC transporter TliD(see: FIG.  1 ). After the recombinant vector pBsB-ACYC was digested with BamHI and SalI, BamHI-XhoI-digested fragment of pJH9 was inserted to construct a recombinant vector pABC-ACYC containing genes encoding ABC transporter TliD, ABC transporter TliE and ABC transporter TliF(see: FIG.  1 ). In addition, a transformant was constructed by transforming  E. coli  XL1-Blue with ABC transporter-expressing vector pABC-ACYC. The transformed  E. coli  was named  Escherichia coli  XL1-Blue/pABC-ACYC′, and deposited with the Korean Collection for Type Cultures(KCTC, #52, Oun-dong, Yusong-ku, Taejon 305-333, Republic of Korea) an international depository authority, on Mar. 9, 1999 as an accession number of KCTC 0586BP. Then, transformants were prepared by simultaneously transforming two vectors of pABC-ACYC expressing ABC transporter and pHOPE expressing lipase into  E. coli  XL1-Blue, and inoculated in a test tube containing 5 ml LB, and incubated at 25° C. for 2 days. As a result, it was determined that 19 U/ml of lipase was secreted extracellularly. On the contrary, original strain  P. fluorescens  secretes only 1.7 U/ml of lipase when it is incubated for 7 days under the same condition. 
 EXAMPLE 4 
 Secretion of Protease by ABC Transporter Gene 
 Though protease gene located upstream of ABC transporter gene does not constitute an operon with ABC transporter genre, protease secreted extracellularly by the ABC transporter gene was examined as follows: To prepare a recombinant vector containing protease gene located upstream of ABC transporter gene, polymerase chain reaction was carried out by employing a forward primer of 5′-AAGAATTCACTTCTGAAAGTTGCTGGCGT-3′ (see;. SEQ ID NO:8) and a reverse primer of 5′- TTAAGCTTGTGGTTTATCTTCCTTGAACC-3′ (see: SEQ ID NO:9), respectively, where the former possesses EcoRI recognition site and the latter possesses HindIII recognition site. Amplified PCR product contained protease and protease inhibitor genes. Amplified gene was digested with EcoRI/HindIII and inserted into EcoRI-HindIII-digested pUC18 to give a recombinant vector ‘pPROT705’ (see: FIG.  1 ). The recombinant vector ‘pPROT705’ and pABC-ACYC containing ABC transporter gene were introduced into  E. coli  to construct transformants, and the transformants were incubated at 25° C. to secrete protease to extracellular medium. On the other hand, protease was not detected at all in culture media when only the recombinant vector pPROT705 expressing protease and protease inhibitor was introduced into  E. coli  and incubated. 
 EXAMPLE 5 
 Secretion of Lipase by Culturing of Transformants 
 To confirm whether lipase is secreted extracellularly or not,  E. coli  transformants harboring ABC transporter-expressing vector pABC-ACYC constructed in Example 3 and lipase-expressing vector pHOPE were cultured. As a control,  E. coli  carrying pSTV29 free of ABC transporter gene and lipase-expressing vector pHOPE was incubated under the same condition. And then, activity of lipase secreted extracellularly was examined: 2 transformants were inoculated on LB media, incubated at 25° C. sufficiently, and inoculated again in 100 ml of LB media to reach a concentration of 1% (v/v). When OD 600  value reached 0.3-0.6, IPTG was added to induce lipase expression and incubated again at 25° C. for about 2 days. Cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture media, and lipase existed in supernatant was assayed by pH-STAT method that titrates fatty acids hydrolyzed from lipid(see: FIGS. 2 a  and  2   b ) . In FIGS. 2 a  and  2   b ,(o) represents  E. coli  carrying ABC transporter-expressing vector pABC-ACYC. constructed in Example 3 and lipase-expressing vector pHOPE; (),  E. coli  carrying Pstv29 and lipase-expressing vector pHOPE. Changes in OD 600  value depending on culture time of these transformants and activity of lipase in media were shown in FIGS. 2 a  and  2   b , respectively. Consequently, it was found that a transformant() carrying pSTV29 and pHOPE could not secrete lipase extracellularly, while a transformant(o) carrying pABC-ACYC and pHOPE secreted lipase to the extracellular medium. 
 EXAMPLE 6 
 Homologous Expression of TliDEFA in  P. fluorescens    
 To increase the extracellular production of lipase, the lipase and ABC transporter gene were introduced into  P. fluorescens . Broad-host-range vector, pDSK519(see: Keen, N. T. et al., Gene, 70(1):191-7(1988)) was used for the construction of pAJH5 containing tliA and pAJH10 containing tliDEFA(see: FIG.  1 ). The inserts of two plasmids excluded a native promoter upstream of tliD and were under the control of lac promoter of the vectors.  P. fluorescens  harboring pAJH5 or pAJH10 was grown at different temperatures and harvested at the stationary phase when they reached an OD 600  value of around 2.7 . P. fluorescens harboring tlia or tliDEFA secreted the lipase only at below  30° C. as was in  E. coli  harboring tliDEFA. These results demonstrated that the ABC transporter was functional at lower temperature in its original host and definitely accountable for higher production of the lipase at lower temperature in  P. fluorescens. P. fluorescens  harboring pAJH10 secreted much more lipase than  E. coli  harboring pAJH10 at 25° C.  P. fluorescens  harboring pAJH5 also secreted the small amount of lipase at 25° C. by chromosomal ABC transporter gene, although no lipase was secreted by  E. coli  harboring pAJH5. 
 Much more lipase was secreted by  P. fluorescens  complemented by ABC transporter and lipase gene than  P. fluorescens  complemented only by the lipase gene.  P. fluorescons  secreting lipase with one copy of tliDEF in the chromosome seemed to secrete more lipase by increasing the copy number of tliDEF. In order to investigate the effect of gene dosage, lipase(tliA) and ABC transporter/lipase(tliDEFA) genes were inserted into another broad-host-range vector, pRK415(see: Keen, N. T. et al., Gene, 70(1):191-7(1988)), resulting in pAJH3 and PAJH11, respectively.  P. fluorescens  carrying the various plasmids and sets of dual plasmids were grown at 25° C. The secreted lipase was detected by the activity and Western blotting of each culture supernatant.  P. fluorescens  containing dual vector sets(pAJH3 and pAJH10; pAJH11 and pAJH10) secreted more lipase than  P. fluorescens  containing only one vector indicating that increased gene of ABC transporter and lipase enabled  P. fluorescens  to secrete more lipase. 
 EXAMPLE 7 
 Expression of tliDEFA in Various Pseudomonas sp. 
 To investigate whether tliA and tliDEF could be expressed in other Pseudomonas, pAJH5 and pAJH10 were introduced by conjugation into various Pseudomonas species;  P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. fragi, P. putida , and  P. syringae  from Pseudomonas rRNA subgroup I;  P. acidovorans ( Comamonas acidovorans ) from subgroup III. They were all grown in LB at 25° C. for the expression of tliDEF, because tliDEF was functional at below 30° C.  P. aeruginosa  and  E. coli  were also grown at 37° C. because they grew too slowly at 25° C. The lipase activity of the culture supernatant of different Pseudomonas species was measured (see: Table 1). When  P. fluorescens  harboring pAJH10 were grown in LB, they reached around OD 600 =2.7 ±0.2(DCW-1.9 q/L) and secreted the lipase up to 999±70 U/ml which corresponded to 130 μg/ml of lipase based on the protein concentration of culture supernatant and the percentage(74%) of lipase in the supernatant on SDS-PAGE. Recombinant  P. fluorescens  harboring tliDEFA secreted the lipase 70 times more than  P. fluorescens  harboring only tliA(14±4 U/ml), while original  P. fluorescens  secreted no lipase(<1 U/ml) in LB and 2-3 U/ml of lipase in nutrient broth after prolonged incubation at low temperature.

   a   P. aeruginosa  and  E. coli  were grown at 37° C., and  P. acidovorans, P. fluorescens, P. fragi, P. syringe  and  E. coli  ( E. coli @25) were grown at 25° C. in LB medium. The cells were harvested at the stationary phase when they reached an OD 600  around 2.7.  
 
 
 
 
 
 Other Pseudomonas species carrying no plasmid did not secrete the lipase in LB(<1 U/ml). Recombinant  P. syringae  and  P. putida  harboring pAJH5 secreted the lipase, where only tliA was expressed in these strains. It meant that these hosts had inherent ABC transporter for the lipase although there has been no report on the lipase secreted by ABC transporter or ABC transporter itself in these species. Recombinant  P. fluorescens, P. fragi, P. syringae , and  P. putida  secreted much more lipase by the supplemented pAJH10 containing tliDEFA. The ABC transporter was functional in these Pseudomonas species but not functional in  P. aeruginosa  and  P. acidovorans.    
 It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain changes and modifications can be made to this invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as it is set forth herein. 
 As clearly illustrated and demonstrated above, the present invention provides ABC transporter gene of  P. fluorescens  encoding a protein which enhances the secretion of foreign proteins extracellularly, a recombinant expression vector containing the transporter gene, a microorganism transformed therewith and a process for preparing foreign proteins which comprises the stops of incubating the transformant, inducing expression of the proteins and leading the proteins to be secreted extracellularly. In accordance with the present invention, foreign proteins can be secreted extracellularly in a simple and efficient manner by employing a secretion system associated with the ABC transporter gene.
