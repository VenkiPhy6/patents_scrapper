The method of claim 16, further comprising growing at least a first plant from said rooted plantlets. 18. A method of introducing a desired trait into a broccoli line comprising: (a) crossing a plant of line BRM-53-3950CMS or BRM-53-3924SI with a second broccoli plant that comprises a desired trait to produce F1 progeny, a sample of seed of said lines having been deposited under ATCC Accession Number PTA 12479, and ATCC Accession Number PTA-12485, respectively; (b) selecting an F1 progeny that comprises the desired trait; (c) backcrossing the selected F1 progeny with a plant of line BRM-53-3950CMS or BRM-53-3924SI to produce backcross progeny; (d) selecting backcross progeny comprising the desired trait and the physiological and morphological characteristic of broccoli line BRM-53-3950CMS or BRM-53 3924SI; and (e) repeating steps (c) and (d) three or more times to produce selected fourth or higher backcross progeny that comprise the desired trait. 19. A broccoli plant produced by the method of claim 18. 20. A method of producing a plant comprising an added trait, the method comprising introducing a transgene conferring the trait into a plant of hybrid RX 05900097, line BRM-53-3950CMS or line BRM-53-3924SI, a sample of seed of said hybrid and lines having been deposited under ATCC Accession Number PTA-12817, ATCC Accession Number PTA-12479, and ATCC Accession Number PTA-12485, respectively. 38 21. A plant produced by the method of claim 20. 22. The plant of claim 1, comprising a transgene. 23. The plant of claim 22, wherein the transgene confers a trait selected from the group consisting of male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, pest resistance, disease resistance, modified fatty acid metabolism, environmental stress tolerance, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism. 24. The plant of claim 1, comprising a single locus conversion. 25. The plant of claim 24, wherein the single locus conversion confers a trait selected from the group consisting of male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, pest resistance, disease resistance, modified fatty acid metabolism, environmental stress tolerance, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism. 26. A method for producing a seed of a plant derived from at least one of hybrid RX 05900097, line BRM-53-3950CMS or line BRM-53-3924SI comprising the steps of: (a) crossing a broccoli plant of hybrid RX 05900097, line BRM-53-3950CMS or line BRM-53-3924SI with itself or a second broccoli plant; a sample of seed of said hybrid and lines having been deposited under ATCC Accession Number PTA 12817, ATCC Accession Number PTA-12479, and ATCC Accession Number PTA-12485, respectively; and (b) allowing seed of a hybrid RX 05900097, line BRM-53-3950CMS or line BRM 53-3924SI-derived broccoli plant to form. 27.
