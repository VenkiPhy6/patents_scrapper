 1. A process for producing methacrylic acid from methacrylonitrile comprising 
 (a) contacting methacrylonitrile in a suitable aqueous reaction mixture with a catalyst characterized by a nitrile hydratase activity and an amidase activity of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D (ATCC 55744); and  
 (b) isolating the methacrylic acid produced in (a) in the from of a salt or acid.  
 
     
 2. The process of  claim 1  wherein the catalyst is in the form of microbial cells transformed to express  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. 
 
     
 3. The process of  claim 1  further comprising before step (a) heating the catalyst of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D (ATCC 55744) to a temperature of about 35째 C. to 70째 C. for between 10 and 120 minutes, whereby thermally unstable nitrile hydratase activity is inactivated, and thermostable nitrile hydratase and amidase activities are preserved. 
 
     
 4. A process for producing acrylic acid from acrylonitrile comprising 
 (a) contacting acrylonitrile in a suitable aqueous reaction mixture with an catalyst characterized by a nitrile hydratase and amidase activity of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D (ATCC 5744); and  
 (b) isolating the acrylic acid produced in (a) in the form of a salt or acid.  
 
     
 5. The process of  claim 4  wherein the catalyst is in the form of microbial cells transformed to express  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D nitrile hydratase and amidase activities. 
 
     
 6. The process of  claim 4  further comprising before step (a) heating the catalyst of  Comamonas testosteroni  5-MGAM-4D (ATCC 55744) to a temperature of about 35째 C. to 70째 C. for between 10 and 120 minutes, whereby a thermally unstable nitrile hydratase activity is inactivated, and the thermostable nitrile hydratase and amidase activities are preserved.
