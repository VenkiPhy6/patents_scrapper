 1. A method for selecting and/or characterising a fungus, said method including subjecting a fungus to genetic analysis, wherein genetic analysis includes: 
 sequencing one or more non-coding nrDNA regions; sequencing one or more regions of a protein-coding gene; assessing the genetic variation of the sequenced regions; and optionally selecting a fungus having a desired genetic variation. 
 
     
 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the nrDNA is selected from one or more of genes encoding small subunit (SSU), large subunit (LSU), and 5.8S nrDNAs, and fragments thereof. 
 
     
 3. A method according to claim 2, wherein the non-coding nrDNA is selected from one or more of an ETS, NTS or ITS spacer. 
 
     
 4. A method according to claim 3, wherein the non-coding nrDNA is an ITS spacer. 
 
     
 5. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the protein coding gene is one which is not highly conserved. 
 
     
 6. A method according to claim 5, wherein the protein-coding gene is selected from one or more of a tub2 gene, a tefA gene and an ac/1 gene, and fragments thereof. 
 
     
 7. A method according to claim 6, wherein the protein-coding gene is a tub2 gene. 
 
     
 8. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the fungus is an endophyte of a plant. 
 
     
 9. A method according to claim 8, wherein the plant is a grass. 
 10. A method according to claim 9, wherein the grass is a forage, turf or bioenergy grass, 
 WO 2018/027276 
 PCT/AU2017/050848 
 11. A method according to claim 10, wherein the grass is a plant of the BrachiariaUrochloa complex. 
 12. A method according to any one of claim 1 to 11, wherein the method includes the 5 further step of subjecting the fungus to a morphological analysis. 
 13. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein the method includes the further step of subjecting the fungus to a metabolic analysis. 
 
     
 10 14. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 13, wherein the method includes the further step of assessing geographic origin of the fungus.
