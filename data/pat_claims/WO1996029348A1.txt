 1. A monoclonal antibody against H4-1BB which preferentially binds to at least a portion of receptor protein H4-1BB. 
 
 
 2. A hybridoma capable of producing a monoclonal antibody of claim 1. 
 
 
 3. A method of using the monoclonal antibody of claim 1 to enhance T-cell proliferation comprising the step of treating T-cells that have expressed receptor protein H4-1BB with said monoclonal antibody. 
 
 
 4. The method of claim 3 further comprising the step of conducting said treatment in the presence of co-stimulatory molecule. 
 
 
 5. A method of using the monoclonal antibody of claim 1 to enhance T-cell activation comprising the step of treating T-cells that have expressed receptor protein H4-1BB with said monoclonal antibody. 
 
 
 6. The method of claim 5 further comprising the step of conducting said treatment in the presence of co-stimulatory molecule. 
 
 
 7. The method of using the monoclonal antibody of claim 1 to inhibit the interaction of H4-1BB and its ligand.   
 
 
 8. The method of using the monoclonal antibody of claim 1 to aid in killing cancer cells by using said monoclonal antibody to activate T-cells against said cancer cells. 
 
 
 9. The method of using the monoclonal antibody of claim 1 to treat autoimmune diseases by using the monoclonal antibody to inhibit the interaction of H4-1BB and its ligand. 
 
 
 10. The method of using the monoclonal antibody of claim 1 to block a patient's immune response during organ transplantation by using the monoclonal antibody to inhibit the interaction of H4-1BB and its ligand. 
 
 
 11. An antibody that is immuno reactive with a purified human 4- IBB polypeptide comprising the N-terminal amino acid sequence aLeu-Gln-Asp-Pro-Cys-Ser-Asn- Cys-Pro-Ala-Gly-Thr. 
 
 
 12. An -antibody of claim 1 1, wherein said antibody is a monoclonal antibody.
