 Claim 5. A method for initiating antibody induced cellular cytotoxicity of cancerous cells in a tissue sample selected from a human tumor comprising: providing a tissue sample from said human tumor; providing the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the IDAC as accession number 280306-03 or a CDMAB thereof, which CDMAB is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen; and contacting said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof with said tissue sample; wherein binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof with said tissue sample induces cellular cytotoxicity. 
 
 
 Claim 6. A CDMAB of the isolated monoclonal antibody of claim 1. 
 
 
 Claim 7. A CDMAB of the humanized antibody of claim 2. 
 
 
 Claim 8. A CDMAB of the chimeric antibody of claim 3. 
 
 
 Claim 9. The isolated antibody or CDMAB thereof, of any one of claims 1 , 2, 3, 6, 7 or 8 conjugated with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, and hematogenous cells.  
 
 
  Claim 10. A method of treating a human tumor in a mammal, wherein said human tumor expresses an at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody encoded by a clone deposited with the IDAC as accession number 280306-03 or a CDMAB thereof, which CDMAB is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, comprising administering to said mammal said monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof in an amount effective to result in a reduction of said mammaPs tumor burden. 
 
 
 Claim 1 1. The method of claim 10 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. 
 
 
 Claim 12. The method of claim 1 1 wherein said cytotoxic moiety is a radioactive isotope. 
 
 
 Claim 13. The method of claim 10 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof activates complement. 
 
 
 Claim 14. The method of claim 10 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 
 
 
 Claim 15. The method of claim 10 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is humanized. 
 
 
 Claim 16. The method of claim 10 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is chimerized. 
 
 
 Claim 17. A method of treating a human tumor susceptible to antibody induced cellular cytotoxicity in a mammal, wherein said human tumor expresses at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody encoded by a clone deposited with the IDAC as accession number 280306-03 or a CDMAB thereof, which CDMAB is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, comprising administering to said mammal said monoclonal antibody or said CDMAB thereof in an amount effective to result in a reduction of said mammal's tumor burden. 
 
 
 Claim 18. The method of claim 17 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety.   
 
 
 Claim 19. The method of claim 18 wherein said cytotoxic moiety is a radioactive isotope. 
 
 
 Claim 20. The method of claim 17 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof activates complement. 
 
 
 Claim 21. The method of claim 17 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 
 
 
 Claim 22. The method of claim 17 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is humanized. 
 
 
 Claim 23. The method of claim 17 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is chimerized. 
 
 
 Claim 24. An isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof, capable of specific binding to human CD63, in which the isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof reacts with the same epitope or epitopes of human CD63 as the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line AR75A 105.8 having IDAC Accession No. 280306-03; said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof being characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target human CD63 antigen. 
 
 
 Claim 25. An isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof that recognizes the same epitope or epitopes as those recognized by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line AR75A 105.8 having IDAC Accession No. 280306- 03; said monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof being characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target epitope or epitopes. 
 
 
 Claim 26. A process for treating a human cancerous tumor which expresses at least one epitope of human CD63 antigen which is specifically bound by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by hybridoma cell line AR75A105.8 having IDAC Accession No. 280306-03, comprising: administering to an individual suffering from said human cancer, at least one isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof that recognizes the same epitope or  epitopes as those recognized by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line AR75A 105.8 having IDAC Accession No. 280306-03; wherein binding of said epitope or epitopes results in a reduction of tumor burden. 
 
 
 Claim 27. A process for treating a human cancerous tumor which expresses at least one epitope of human CD63 antigen which is specifically bound by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by hybridoma cell line AR75A 105.8 having IDAC Accession No. 280306-03, comprising: administering to an individual suffering from said human cancer, at least one isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof, that recognizes the same epitope or epitopes as those recognized by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line AR75A 105.8 having IDAC Accession No. 280306-03; in conjunction with at least one chemotherapeutic agent; wherein said administration is results in a reduction of tumor burden.
