 (a) detecting the presence or absence of MN/CA IX protein or MN/CA IX polypeptide in a sample comprising neoplastic cells taken from said vertebrate, comprising immunologically assaying said sample with the M75 monoclonal antibody secreted by hybridoma VU-M75 which has Accession No. ATCC HB 11128, 
 (b) if MN/CA IX protein or MN/CA IX polypeptide is present in said sample, quantitating the level and/or extent of said MN/CA IX protein or MN/CA IX polypeptide relative to the number of cells in said sample, and 
 (c) determining that said vertebrate has a prognosis of shorter cumulative survival if the level and/or extent of MN/CA IX protein or MN/CA IX polypeptide of steps (a) and (b) indicates that 50% or fewer of cells in said sample express MN/CA IX protein or MN/CA IX polypeptide; 
 wherein said MN/CA IX protein or MN/CA IX polypeptide is encoded by a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of: 
 (1) SEQ ID NO: 1's coding region; 
 (2) nucleotide sequences that hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions of 50% formamide at 42 degree C. to complement of SEQ ID NO: 1's coding region; and 
 (3) nucleotide sequences that differ from SEQ ID NO: 1's coding region or from the nucleotide sequences of (2) in codon sequence due to the degeneracy of the genetic code; 
 and wherein said MN/CA IX protein or said MN/CA IX polypeptide is specifically bound by the M75 monoclonal antibody that is secreted from the hybridoma VU-M75 which has Accession No. ATCC HB 11128.
