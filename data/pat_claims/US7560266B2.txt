 2. The consortium of  claim 1  comprising a bacterial strain having a 16S rRNA gene sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and mixtures thereof. 
 
     
 3. A method of enhancing biodegradation of a sulfonated aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester having greater than 60 mol percent aromatic acid content based on total diol or total dicarboxylic acid in the co-polyester, the method comprising:
 a. providing a bacterial consortium as recited in  claim 1 ; 
 b. contacting the bacterial consortium with a sulfonated aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester having greater than 60 mol percent aromatic acid content based on total diol or total dicarboxylic acid in the co-polyester; and 
 c. growing the bacterial consortium in a growth medium under suitable reaction conditions whereby the co-polyester is biodegraded. 
 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the bacterial consortium comprises a bacterial strain having a 16S rRNA gene sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 5, 6, 7,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and mixtures thereof. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the co-polyester comprises more than 70 mol percent aromatic acid content based on total diol or total dicarboxylic acid in the co-polyester. 
 
     
 6. The method according to  claim 5 , wherein the co-polyester comprises more than 80 mol percent aromatic acid content based on total diol or total dicarboxylic acid in the co-polyester. 
 
     
 7. The method according to  claim 6 , wherein the co-polyester comprises more than 90 mol percent aromatic acid content based on total diol or total dicarboxylic acid in the co-polyester. 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the suitable reaction conditions include a pH of from about 6.5 to about 9.5. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the suitable reaction conditions include a temperature of from about 45° C. to about 70° C. 
 
     
 10. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the suitable reaction conditions include supplementation of the growth medium with a compound selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid and methyl ester thereof, adipic acid, glutaric acid, ethylene glycol, basal medium SMV1 and combinations thereof.
