 the biomass contains bacteriochlorophyll in a range of from 0.2 to 3.0 weight %. 
 
 
     
 3. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 the biomass contains bacteriochlorophyll in a range of from 0.6 to 1.9 weight %. 
 
 
     
 4. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 the biomass contains a carotinoid material in a range of 0.5 to 7.5 μmol/g. 
 
 
     
 5. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 the biomass contains a carotinoid material in a range of 2.4 to 4.0 μmol/g. 
 
 
     
 6. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 after being subjected to acid hydrolysis, the biomass has a glucose contents ranging from 2.4 to 7.5 weight %, a ribose content ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 weight %, a rhamnose content ranging from 1.0 to 3.3 weight %, and a fucose content ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 weight %. 
 
 
     
 7. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 after subjected to acid hydrolysis, the biomass has a glucose content ranging from 3.5 to 6.5 weight %, a ribose content ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 weight %, a rhamnose content ranging from 1.2 to 3.0 weight %, and a fucose content ranging from 0.8 to 2.4 weight %. 
 
 
     
 8. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 after being subjected to water-washing and subsequently to acid hydrolysis, the biomass has a glucose content ranging from 1.0 3.0 weight %, a ribose content ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 weight %, a rhamnose content ranging from 0.5 to 1.6 weight %, and a fucose content of 0.5 weight % or less. 
 
 
     
 9. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 the lactic acid bacterium is  Lactobacillus  spp. 
 
 
     
 10. The drug as set forth in  claim 1 , wherein:
 the lactic acid bacterium is  Lactobacillus bulcialicus.    
 
 
     
 11. A method of manufacturing a drug, comprising the steps of:
 incubating in a liquid medium  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  FERMBP-7434 strain together with a lactic acid bacterium to produce a biomass comprising a viscous material in the liquid medium, and 
 separating the biomass comprising a viscous material from the liquid medium.
