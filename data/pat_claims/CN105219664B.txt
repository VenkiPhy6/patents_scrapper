It is, pichia pastoris yeast (Pichia pastoris) GS115/pPIC9K-xynAm culture presevation number is CGMCC
No.10696。 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. genetic engineering bacterium pichia pastoris yeast (Pichia pastoris) GS115/pPIC9K- as described in claim 1
β-D-1,4- the endo xylanase genes sequence of xynAm, which is characterized in that the sequence is as shown in SEQ ID NO.1. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. genetic engineering bacterium pichia pastoris yeast (Pichia pastoris) GS115/pPIC9K- as described in claim 1
β-D-1,4- the endo-xylanase amino acid sequence of xynAm, which is characterized in that the sequence is as shown in SEQ ID No.4. 
 
     
 
   
 
 4. a kind of genetic engineering bacterium pichia pastoris yeast (Pichia pastoris) GS115/ as described in claim 1
PPIC9K-xynAm is preparing the application in β-D-1,4- endo-xylanase. 
 
     
 
   
 
 5. a kind of β-D-1 as claimed in claim 2,4- endo xylanase genes sequence optimisation method, which is characterized in that institute
Steps are as follows for the specific optimization method stated: 
 (1) anaerobic fungi Orpinomyces sp. PC-2 β-D-1,4- endo xylanase genes are retrieved in GenBank
Sequence, accession number: U57819； 
 (2) password of the N-terminal coding MRTIKFLFALAITTVAKA of the β-D-1,4- endo xylanase genes of step (1) is deleted
Son； 
 (3) it is tentatively replaced according to codon of the preference of the yeast codon to β-D-1,4- endo xylanase genes； 
 (4) using the restriction enzyme cleavage sites in gene order after 6.0 analytical procedure of Oligo (3) replacement, by close
Numeral adjusts, the cleavage site of Bgl II, Sac I, Sal I, SnaB I and Avr II in elimination gene order； 
 (5) mRNA cryptic splice site in gene order after being adjusted using 7.0 analytical procedure of BioEdit (4), and it is right again
Codon is adjusted, with eliminate cryptic splice site GGTAAG, GGTGAT, AATAAA, ATTTA, AAAAAA therein and
The unstable motif of TTTTTT and mRNA, and GC percentage is calculated, codon is further adjusted according to GC percentage, is made at its
Between 40%-50%； 
 (6) analysis freely can be carried out to the mRNA secondary structure of step (5) using RNA Structure 3.2, screening obtains
The minimum gene order of free energy is obtained, xynAm is named as； 
 (7) SEQ ID No. 1 is obtained using full genome synthetic method by the xynAm gene order obtained to step (6) screening
Shown nucleotide sequence. 
 
     
 
   
 
 6. the recombinant vector of β-D-1, the 4- endo xylanase genes xynAm optimized according to claim 2, feature exist
In the recombinant vector is pPIC9K-xynAm, the specific construction method of the recombinant vector pPIC9K-xynAm are as follows: by right
It is required that the 5 xynAm genes provided and yeast expression vector pPIC9K use SnaB I and Avr II double digestion, recovery purifying
Digestion products, the target gene and expression vector of purifying are attached using T4 DNA ligase, convert bacillus coli DH 5 alpha, warp
The identification of PCR and BamH I and Sal I double digestion obtains recombinant expression carrier pPIC9K-xynAm. 
 
     
 
   
 
 7. a kind of genetic engineering bacterium pichia pastoris yeast as described in claim 1 (Pichia pastoris) GS115/
High activity β-D-1,4- the endo-xylanase of pPIC9K-xynAm preparation. 
 
     
 
   
 
 8. high activity β-D-1,4- endo-xylanase as claimed in claim 7 is for answering in non-treatment mesh degradation of xylan
With.
