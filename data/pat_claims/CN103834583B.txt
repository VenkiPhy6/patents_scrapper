 2. a method for sour horse breast is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation, it is characterized in that, concrete preparation method's step is as follows: 
 (1) horse breast pre-treatment: fresh horse breast was passed through the impurity and the foreign matter that filter horse Ruzhong, then horse breast is preheating to 60-65 DEG C, homogeneous 10-15min under 20MPa condition, by the pasteurize of horse breast after homogeneous, treats that fermentation is used; The horse breast consumption that female fermented liquid, fermented liquid 1 and fermented liquid 2 need pre-treatment good is 3:20:20 by volume; 
 (2) preparation of seed fermentation liquid and female fermented liquid: 
 Seed fermentation liquid: Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (Kluyveromycesmarxianus) WWMJ-1CGMCCNo.8432 preserved at 4 DEG C, Lactococcus lactis (Lactococcuslactis), lactobacterium casei (Lactobacilluscasei) and monascus ruber (Monascusruber) bacterial classification are inoculated in an aseptic environment, is inoculated in MRS substratum respectively and is placed in 37 DEG C of cultivation 18-24h by Lactococcus lactis (Lactococcuslactis) and lactobacterium casei (Lactobacilluscasei); Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (Kluyveromycesmarxianus) WWMJ-1CGMCCNo.8432 is inoculated in YPD substratum and is placed in 28 DEG C of cultivation 24-48h; Monascus ruber (Monascusruber) is inoculated in malt extract medium and is placed in 30 DEG C of cultivation 48-72h activation, for subsequent use; 
 Female fermented liquid: selected by female fermented liquid good for step (1) pre-treatment horse breast consumption to be divided into 3:3:10:14 to be sub-packed in fermenting container by volume, aseptically, above-mentioned Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (Kluyveromycesmarxianus) the WWMJ-1CGMCCNo.8432 seed fermentation liquid activated is accessed in corresponding fermenting container according to volume basis 5% inoculum size, be placed in 28 DEG C and cultivate 24-48h, for subsequent use; The above-mentioned Lactococcus lactis (Lactococcuslactis) that activated and lactobacterium casei (Lactobacilluscasei) seed fermentation liquid are accessed in corresponding fermenting container according to volume basis 5% inoculum size, be placed in 37 DEG C and cultivate 18-24h, for subsequent use; Above-mentioned monascus ruber (Monascusruber) the seed fermentation liquid activated is accessed in corresponding fermenting container according to volume basis 5% inoculum size, is placed in 30 DEG C and cultivates 48-72h, for subsequent use; 
 (3) preparation of fermented liquid: fermented liquid is made up of fermented liquid 1 and fermented liquid 2; 
 The preparation of fermented liquid 1: Lactococcus lactis step (2) prepared, lactobacterium casei, Kluyveromyces marxianus fermented liquid consumption are according to volume basis (1.4-1.5): (1.4-1.5): (5-5.2) is inoculated in the horse Ruzhong that fermented liquid 1 consumption is selected well in step (1) pre-treatment, be 4-4.5g/100mL at sugared addition, leavening temperature 32-33 DEG C, fermentation time is that 50-55h condition bottom fermentation obtains fermented liquid 1; 
 The preparation of fermented liquid 2: the female fermented liquid of monascus step (2) prepared is inoculated according to volume basis 7-7.5% the horse Ruzhong that fermented liquid 2 consumption is selected well in step (1) pre-treatment, be 5g/100ml at sugared addition, leavening temperature 28-29 DEG C, fermentation time 7-8d condition bottom fermentation obtains fermented liquid 2; 
 (4) mixed fermentation liquid: the fermented liquid 1 prepare step (3) and fermented liquid 2 mix according to the ratio of volume basis 1:1, carry out sterile filling after carrying out pasteurize, preserves at 4 DEG C. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. the method for sour horse breast is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation as claimed in claim 2, it is characterized in that, in described horse breast pre-treatment, horse breast is preheating to 65 DEG C, homogeneous 10min under 20MPa condition, by the pasteurize of horse breast after homogeneous. 
 
     
 
   
 
 4. the method for sour horse breast is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation as claimed in claim 2, and it is characterized in that, the sugared addition of described fermented liquid 1 is 4g/100ml, and leavening temperature 33 DEG C, fermentation time are 53h condition bottom fermentation. 
 
     
 
   
 
 5. the method for sour horse breast is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation as claimed in claim 2, and it is characterized in that, the sugared addition of described fermented liquid 2 is 5g/100ml, leavening temperature 29 DEG C, fermentation time 7d condition bottom fermentation. 
 
     
 
   
 
 6. the method for sour horse breast is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation as claimed in claim 2, it is characterized in that, described Lactococcus lactis (Lactococcuslactis), lactobacterium casei (Lactobacilluscasei), Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (Kluyveromycesmarxianus) WWMJ-1CGMCCNo.8432 fermented liquid prepare fermented liquid 1 according to volume basis 1.5:1.5:5 inoculation. 
 
     
 
   
 
 7. the method for sour horse breast is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation as claimed in claim 2, it is characterized in that, described monascus ruber (Monascusruber) fermented liquid prepares fermented liquid 2 according to volume basis 7% inoculation. 
 
     
 
   
 
 8. one kind as claimed in claim 2 composite bacteria mixed fermentation prepare sour horse breast prepared by sour horse breast method.
