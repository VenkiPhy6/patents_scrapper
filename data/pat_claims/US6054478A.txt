 1. A compound of the formula (I) ##STR14## and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates or metabolically labile derivatives thereof, wherein R 1  represents hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl or C 1-4  alkoxy;   R 2  represents hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, C 1-10  alkoxy, C 1-10  alkylthio, C 1-6  alkoxyC 1-4  alkoxy, arylC 1-6  alkyloxy, arylC 3-6  alkenyloxy, azido, NR 5  COR 5  where each R 5  is independently hydrogen or C 1-6  alkyl, OR 6  (where R 6  is a cyclic ether containing 4 to 8 atoms linked to the oxygen atom via a ring carbon atom adjacent to the ring oxygen atom or a group ##STR15## where Y is oxygen, sulphur or NH, X is either a bond, an oxygen atom or a moiety NR 8  in which R 8  is hydrogen or C 1-6  alkyl, and R 7  is C 1-10  alkyl optionally containing one or two double bonds, aryl, arylC 1-4  alkyl, arylC 2-4  alkenyl, haloC 1-6  alkyl or C 1-6  alkoxyC 1-4  alkyl, and R 3  represents hydrogen, or R 2  and R 3  may together with the carbon atom to which they are attached represent C═O or C═NOR 9  where R 9  is C 1-6  alkyl; and   R 4  represents hydroxyl, C 1-6  alkoxy or ##STR16## (where R 7  is as defined above); with the proviso that when R 1  represents a hydroxyl group in the axial configuration and R 4  is methoxy then R 2  cannot represent a group in the axial configuration selected from hydroxyl and OCOCH═ z  CH--CH═ E  CHCH 3 .   
 
     
 2. A compound of the general formula (1a) ##STR17## and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates (e.g. hydrates) thereof, wherein R 1  to R 4  are as defined in formula (I) above. 
 
     
 3. A compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein R 1  represents hydrogen or hydroxyl. 
 
     
 4. A compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein R 2  is in the axial configuration and R 3  is hydrogen. 
 
     
 5. A compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein R 2  is C 1-6  alkoxy, C 1-6  alkylthio, azido or OCOR 7 . 
 
     
 6. A compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein R 4  is C 1-4  alkoxy. 
 
     
 7. A method of treatment of the human or non-human animal body to combat fungal diseases which method comprises administering to said body an effective amount of a compound as claimed in claim 1. 
 
     
 8. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound as claimed in claim 1 in admixture with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients. 
 
     
 9. A compound of formula (V) ##STR18## or a protected derivative thereof. 
 
     
 10. A process for the preparation of a compound of formula (V) which comprises (a) cultivating a microorganism capable of producing the compound of formula (V) and thereafter isolating the compound of formula (V) from the culture,   (b) the biotransformation of sordarin.
