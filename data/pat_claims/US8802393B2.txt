 1. A method for producing an arabinose isomerase comprising the steps of:
 preparing a recombinant vector by inserting a gene encoding a thermophilic arabinose isomerase, which has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 originating from the  Thermotoga neapolitana  DSM 5068, into the shuttle vector pCJ-1(KCCM 10611) or pCJ-7(KCCM 10617); 
 transfecting a  Corynebacterium  sp. strain with the recombinant vector; and 
 producing the arabinose isomerase by culturing the  Corynebacterium  sp. strain. 
 
 
     
 2. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the strain is  Corynebacterium glutamicum  CJ-1-TNAI (KCCM 10786P). 
 
     
 3. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the strain is  Corynebacterium glutamicum  CJ-7-TNAI (KCCM 10787P).
