 culturing  Mortierella alpina  SAM2153 FERM BP-6794, at a temperature lower than the optimum growth temperature from the start of culturing or after culturing at the optimum growth temperature; and then 
 recovering said arachidonic acid-containing microbial lipid from the culture. 
 
 
     
 2. The process according to  claim 1  comprising culturing said  Mortierella alpina  SAM2153 FERM BP-6794, in a medium containing hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty acid salts, or lipids containing them as components; or adding to the culture in which said  Mortierella alpina  SAM2153 FERM BP-6794, is being cultured hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty acid salts, or lipids containing them as components, and then further culturing. 
 
     
 3. A process for producing an arachidonic acid-containing microbial lipid comprising:
 culturing  Mortierella alpina  SAM2153 FERM BP-6794, at a temperature lower than 20° C. from the start of culturing or after culturing at 20 to 40° C.; and then 
 recovering said arachidonic acid-containing microbial lipid from the culture. 
 
 
     
 4. The method according to  claim 3  comprising culturing said  Mortierella alpina  SAM2153 FERM BP-6794, in a medium containing hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty acid salts, or lipids containing them as components; or adding to the culture in which said  Mortierella alpina  SAM2153 FERM BP-6794, is being cultured hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, fatty acid salts, or lipids containing them as components, and then further culturing.
