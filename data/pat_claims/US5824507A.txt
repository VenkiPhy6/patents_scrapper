 2. A polypeptide that is at least 15 amino acids in length, having at least about 65% sequence identity to the polypeptide of claim 1. 
 
     
 3. A polypeptide of claim 1, which is immunoreactive with sera containing anti-HGV specific antibodies. 
 
     
 4. A polypeptide of claim 1 having at least 65% sequence identity to the 2873 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15. 
 
     
 5. A polypeptide of claim 3 having at least 65% sequence identity to the 2873 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15. 
 
     
 6. A polypeptide of claim 1, where said polypeptide is an E2 polypeptide.

 9. A polypeptide of claim 8 comprising at least 10 contiguous amino acids contained within SEQ ID NO:15. 
 
     
 10. A polypeptide of claim 8, comprising a polypeptide sequence that is encoded by SEQ ID NO:14. 
 
     
 11. A polypeptide of claim 6, encoded by a polynucleotide comprising a series of bases contained within the region extending from base 1149 to base 2183 of SEQ ID NO:14. 
 
     
 12. A fusion polypeptide comprising an HGV polypeptide of claim 1 and a second polypeptide. 
 
     
 13. A polypeptide of claim 12, where said second polypeptide is Î²-galactosidase or glutathione-S-transferase protein sequences. 
 
     
 14. A polypeptide of claim 12, where said second polypeptide comprises a particle forming protein. 
 
     
 15. A polypeptide of claim 1, comprising a contiguous sequence of at least 60 amino acids.   
 
     
 16. A polypeptide of claim 15 comprising the 2873 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15. 
 
     
 17. A polypeptide of claim 15, wherein said contiguous sequence is encoded within a PNF 2161 cDNA source lambda gt11 library identified by ATCC designation number 75268 or ATCC 75837. 
 
     
 18. A diagnostic kit for use in screening a biological fluid sample for the presence of anti-HGV specific antibodies, comprising a polypeptide of claim 3, and   a reporter for detecting an immunoreaction between said polypeptide and anti-HGV specific antibodies present in said sample.   
 
     
 19. A kit of claim 18, comprising a polypeptide of one of claims 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, or 16. 
 
     
 20. A kit of claim 18, comprising a polypeptide of claim 11. 
 
     
 21. A kit of claim 18, for use in screening sera. 
 
     
 22. A kit of claim 18, where said polypeptide antigen is attached to a solid support. 
 
     
 23. A kit of claim 22, wherein said reporter comprises a non-attached labelled anti-human antibody. 
 
     
 24. A method of detecting the presence of anti-HGV specific antibodies in a test subject, comprising reacting a biological fluid sample from an HGV test subject with a HGV polypeptide antigen of claim 3, and   determining the presence of anti-HGV specific antibodies in said sample, as characterized by an immunoreaction between anti-HGV specific antibodies present in said sample and the antigen.   
 
     
 25. A method of claim 24, wherein the polypeptide antigen is attached to a solid support, said reacting includes the steps of reacting the sample with the support, and subsequently reacting the support with a reporter-labelled anti-human antibody, and said determining includes detecting the presence of reporter-labelled antibody on the solid support. 
 
     
 26. A purified Non-A Non-B Non-C Non-D Non-E Hepatitis Virus (HGV), wherein HGV is characterized by: (i) production of elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels in an infected primate, (ii) its serological distinction from hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus, and hepatitis E virus (HEV), and (iii) a viral genome comprising a polynucleotide region that is selectively hybridizable with SEQ ID NO:19. 
 
     
 27. A preparation of polypeptides of claim 1. 
 
     
 28. The method of claim 24, wherein a biological fluid sample from an HGV test subject is reacted with a HGV polypeptide antigen of one of claims 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, or 16.
