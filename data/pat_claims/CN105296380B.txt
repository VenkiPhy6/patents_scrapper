Method obtains： 
 （1）Inoculation：Prepare bacillus subtilis（Bacillus Subtilis）XHS0035Kc CGMCC NO.9434, geotrichum candidum
（Geotrichum Candidum）XHS0030B CGMCC NO.9435 and streptomyces microflavus（Streptomyces
microflavus）The solid medium of XHS0032Xh CGMCC NO.9432 and four kinds of strains of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, sterilizing
Sterile working is strictly carried out afterwards, is forwarded to tablet from inclined-plane, the bacillus subtilis that number is XHS0035Kc is at 28 DEG C of temperature
Culture 3 days, the geotrichum candidum that number is XHS0030B are cultivated 3 days at 25 DEG C of temperature, and the streptomyces microflavus of XHSOO32Xh is in temperature
It is cultivated 3 days at 30 DEG C, Rhodopseudomonas palustris cultivates 3 in the case where 32 DEG C -36 DEG C of temperature, intensity of illumination are the luxs 3500-4500
It； 
 The bacillus subtilis（Bacillus Subtilis）The culture medium of XHS0035Kc CGMCC NO.9434 is pancreas
Peptone soybean agar（TSA）Culture medium, preparation method are：Tryptone 15g, soy peptone 5g, NaCI5g, agar 20g,
Moisturizing is dispensed to 1000mL, pH7.2, sterilizing, you can prepare tryptose soya agar（TSA）Culture medium； 
 The geotrichum candidum（Geotrichum Candidum）The culture medium of XHS0030B CGMCC NO.9435 is cultivated for PDA
Base, preparation method are：Potato is cleaned peeling, takes 200 grams to be cut into small pieces, adds 1000 milliliters of water, after boiling half an hour, supply
Moisture；10 grams of agar are added in filtrate, adds 20 grams of sucrose after boiling dissolving, supplies moisture, dispense, sterilizing, you can preparation obtains
Obtain PDA solid mediums； 
 The streptomyces microflavus（Streptomyces microflavus）The culture medium of XHS0032Xh CGMCC NO.9432
For ISP2 solid mediums, preparation method is：Yeast extract 4.0g, fructus hordei germinatus leaching powder 10.0g, glucose 4.0g, agar 20.0g,
Moisturizing is dispensed to 1000mL, pH7.2, sterilizing, you can prepare ISP2 solid mediums； 
 The culture medium preparation method of the Rhodopseudomonas palustris is：Sodium propionate 3.0g, ammonium sulfate 2.0g, potassium dihydrogen phosphate
0.5g, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 0.5g, magnesium sulfate 0.2g, sodium chloride 0.5g, calcium chloride 0.1g, yeast extract 1.0g, moisturizing to 1000mL,
PH is naturally, packing, sterilizing, you can prepare； 
 （2）Level-one culture：From step（1）In solid medium on picking single bacterium colony be forwarded to the 50mL equipped with fluid nutrient medium
In conical flask, sterile working, the bacillus subtilis that number is XHS0035Kc 28 DEG C of temperature, 120r/min culture for 24 hours-
48h, the geotrichum candidum that number is XHS0030B cultivate -48h for 24 hours, the thin yellow strepto- of XHS0032Xh in 25 DEG C of temperature, 120r/min
Bacterium 30 DEG C of temperature, 120r/min culture -48h, Rhodopseudomonas palustris are in 32 DEG C -36 DEG C of temperature, intensity of illumination for 24 hours
The luxs 3500-4500,120r/min cultivate -48h for 24 hours； 
 （3）Second order fermentation：Above-mentioned steps level-one culture strain is inoculated in the 500mL conical flasks for filling fluid nutrient medium, nothing
Bacterium operate, the bacillus subtilis that number is XHS0035Kc 28 DEG C of temperature, 120r/min culture -48h, number are for 24 hours
The geotrichum candidum of XHS0030B cultivates -48h for 24 hours in 25 DEG C of temperature, 120r/min, and the streptomyces microflavus of XHS0032Xh is in temperature 30
DEG C, 120r/min culture -48h for 24 hours, Rhodopseudomonas palustris is that 3500-4500 is strangled gram in 32 DEG C -36 DEG C of temperature, intensity of illumination
This, 120r/min cultures -48h for 24 hours； 
 （4）The compatibility of strain fermentating liquid：It is assessed according to weight part ratio, optional step（3）The number of preparation is the withered of XHS0035Kc
Careless bacillus second order fermentation liquid 20%-25%, number be XHS0030B geotrichum candidum second order fermentation liquid 15%-20%, number be
The streptomyces microflavus second order fermentation liquid 30%-35% and Rhodopseudomonas palustris 20%-25% second order fermentation liquid of XHS0032Xh is mixed
It closes, prepares the mixed liquor of composite bacteria； 
 （5）Add auxiliary material：By step（4）The composite bacteria mixed liquor of preparation is fully adsorbed in carrier, and carrier selects greenhouse big
Canopy soil；Auxiliary material uses urea and calcium superphosphate, and the wherein weight ratio of urea and calcium superphosphate is 1:2；The use of carrier and auxiliary material
Amount is 1 according to weight ratio:1.5 proportioning mixing, add water to water content 40-70%, then every cubic metre of carrier and auxiliary material by volume
It mixes materials and above-mentioned steps is added（4）The composite bacteria mixed liquor 100-300g of preparation, and be uniformly mixed, prepare composite earth
Earth reparation group agent. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. the application method of composite soil reparation group agent as described in claim 1, which is characterized in that the application method step
It is as follows： 
 Composite soil reparation group agent prepared by claim 1 composting at 20-30 DEG C of air themperature；Composting is in covering straw screen or mat
Lower progress, it is primary that composting starts rear every turning in 30 days, and to water content 40-70%, the composting time continues 120 days for moisturizing when turning；Heap
Soil can be directly applied to after the completion of system after airing to drying. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. application of the composite soil reparation group agent as described in claim 1 in greenhouse soil remediation.
