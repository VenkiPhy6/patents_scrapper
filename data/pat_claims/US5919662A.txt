 1. A process for producing biotin, desthiobiotin, or a combination thereof, comprising the steps of cultivating to a high density an Escherichia coli strain (i) having an ability to form acetate of at most one fifth the amount produced by an isogenic strain of Escherichia coli and (ii) containing a recombinant plasmid comprising a biotin operon, said strain converting a greater percentage of desthiobiotin to biotin than an isogenic strain of Escherichia coli; and   recovering biotin, desthiobiotin, or both.   
 
     
 2. A process according to claim 1, wherein, in the Escherichia coli strain, feedback repression by biotin is removed. 
 
     
 3. A process according to claim 2, wherein the Escherichia coli strain is cultivated in a medium containing 1 to 10 g/l of alanine. 
 
     
 4. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cultivated Escherichia coli strain is obtained by transforming an Escherichia coli strain of deposit no. FERM BP-2116 with said recombinant plasmid. 
 
     
 5. A process for producing biotin, desthiobiotin, or a combination thereof comprising culturing Escherichia coli strain DRK-3323 transformed with plasmid pXBA312, deposit no. FERM BP-2117, wherein said strain has the ability to form acetate of at most one fifth the amount produced by isogenic Escherichia coli strain DRK-332, wherein the feedback repression by biotin is removed in both strain DRK-3323 and in strain DRX-332, and wherein plasmid pXBA312 comprises the biotin operon, and   recovering biotin, desthiobiotin, or both.
