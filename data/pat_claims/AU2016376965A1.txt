 1. A process for producing a flavoured milk product comprising the steps of: 
 (a) providing a milk source; 
 (b) fermenting the milk source using at least one microorganism, to produce a fermented milk source having an acidic pH; and (c) increasing the pH of the fermented milk source using ammonia, wherein the ammonia reacts with the fermented milk source to produce 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl pyrazine, thereby producing a flavoured milk product.
