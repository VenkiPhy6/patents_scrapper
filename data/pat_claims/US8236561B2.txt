A cell expressing E1A and E1B proteins of an adenovirus, said cell comprising a selectable marker, said recombinant nucleic acid further comprising recombinant nucleic acid encoding an IgA molecule in expressible format, wherein said cell is derived from a human embryonic retinoblast cell as deposited under ECACC number 96022940 by stable transfection of said human embryonic retinoblast cell with the recombinant nucleic acid encoding the IgA molecule in expressible format, and wherein said IgA molecule has a constant region comprising amino acids 137 to 489 of SEQ ID NO:3, wherein stable transfection may be determined by selecting those transfected human embryonic retinoblast cells capable of surviving growth in a media selective for the presence of the selectable marker.
