The deposit number of bacterium (Lactobacillus plantarum) WZMX-2 is GCMCC No.12832,16S rDNA gene sequence
Column are as shown in SEQ ID NO.1. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. lactobacillus plantarum (Lactobacillus plantarum) WZMX-2 as described in claim 1 is in whey pear wine system
Application in standby. 
 
     
 3. a kind of preparation method of whey pear wine, which is characterized in that adopt the following technical scheme that 
 (1) activation of strain: by the lactobacillus plantarum saved at 4 DEG C (Lactobacillus plantarum) WZMX-2
CGMCC No. 12832 is inoculated in MRS culture medium in an aseptic environment, is placed in 37 DEG C of cultures for 24 hours；The mark that will be saved at 4 DEG C
Think Kluyveromyces sp (Kluyveromyces marxianus) WWMJ-1 CGMCC No.8432 and common S. cervisiae
It is inoculated in YPD culture medium and activates respectively in an aseptic environment, be placed in 28 DEG C of cultures for 24 hours, constant-temperature preserving is spare； 
 (2) bergamot pear pre-processes: it selects fresh Kuerle delicious pear that handle is gone to clean, is filtered after being squeezed the juice with automatic juice extractor, obtain bergamot pear juice,
It stores at room temperature spare； 
 (3) whey pre-processes: 6%- is added after selecting fresh whey to remove impurity and foreign matter in whey with four layers of filtered through gauze
The amount of 14% v sucrose is uniformly mixed, is preheating to 85 DEG C, homogeneous 5min under the conditions of 20MPa；Whey liquid is carried out after homogeneous
Pasteurize is cooled to room temperature, and sterile preservation is spare； 
 (4) preparation of whey bergamot pear juice mixed liquor: the whey that the bergamot pear juice and 90% debulking step (3) that step (2) are obtained obtain
Mixeding liquid volume 40%-60% is accounted for by bergamot pear juice to be uniformly mixed, and is saved backup at room temperature； 
 (5) preparation of female fermentation liquid: volume percentage is pressed, the whey that (3) the step of 10% obtain is sub-packed in round
In, aseptically, lactobacillus plantarum (Lactobacillus plantarum) WZMX-2 that will be activated by step (1)
CGMCC No.12832, Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (Kluyveromyces marxianus) WWMJ-1 CGMCC
No.8432 and common S. cervisiae are respectively connected in round by 3% inoculative proportion, and condition of culture successively distinguishes 37 DEG C
Culture for 24 hours, 28 DEG C culture for 24 hours, 28 DEG C culture for 24 hours, constant-temperature preserving is spare； 
 (6) it ferments: lactobacillus plantarum (Lactobacillus plantarum) WZMX-2 CGMCC prepared by step (5)
No.12832, Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (Kluyveromyces marxianus) WWMJ-1 and saccharomyces cerevisiae fermented liquid
After mixing according to volume ratio 4:4:2 meter, it is added in the whey bergamot pear juice mixed liquor of the residue 90% of step (4) preparation, 25
- 72h for 24 hours, fermentation termination setting are cultivated at DEG C -37 DEG C are as follows: measurement alcoholic strength reaches 7.8%vol, and measurement total acid reaches 60.84 °
T, measurement total sugar content reach 42.34g/L, and measurement bitter taste peptide content reaches 0.15g/100mL； 
 (7) post-process: after product to fermentation termination, flash distillation sterilization carries out sterile filling and prepares no bitter taste cream after cooling
Clear pear wine. 
 
     
 4. a kind of whey pear wine, which is characterized in that obtain whey pear wine using preparation method as claimed in claim 3.
