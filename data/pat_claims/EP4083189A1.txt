 A method for preparing a dermatological composition for topical application to the skin, employing sweet dairy whey as the starting material, the method comprising the steps of:
 (i) removing the lipid and protein components from said whey, thereby obtaining an aqueous fraction of the sweet dairy whey; 
 (ii) subjecting said aqueous fraction to fermentation by using the isolated strain of  Lactobacillus delbruekii  as defined in claim 1 or 2.   
 
     
 The method according to claim 3, wherein the sweet dairy whey is obtained from bovine milk. 
 
     
 The method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the removal of the lipid component from the sweet dairy whey is carried out by thermocalcic precipitation. 
 
     
 The method according to any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein the removal of the protein component from the sweet dairy whey is carried out by ultrafiltration. 
 
     
 A dermatological composition for topical application to the skin comprising one or more galacto-oligosaccharides and butyric acid,  characterised in that  it is obtainable through the method according to any one of claims 3 to 6.
