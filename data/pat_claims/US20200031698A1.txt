   2 . The composition of  claim 1 , wherein said granules are air-dried to a temperature lower than about 60° C. 
 
     
   3 . The composition of  claim 2 , wherein said dried granules have less than 20% humidity. 
 
     
   4 . The composition of  claim 1 , comprising at least about 32% of said  archaea  microorganisms. 
 
     
   5 . The composition of  claim 4 , comprising at least about 36% of said  archae  microorganisms. 
 
     
   6 . The composition of  claim 1 , wherein said  archaea  microorganisms comprises  Crenarchaeota  bacteria. 
 
     
   7 . The composition of  claim 1 , wherein said  archaea  bacteria comprises  Euryarchaeota  bacteria. 
 
     
   8 . The composition of  claim 1 , wherein said granules have a size from between about 200 microns to about 4 mm. 
 
     
   9 . The composition of  claim 1 , wherein said granules comprise a mixture of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. 
 
     
   10 - 19 . (canceled) 
 
     
   20 . A process for aerobically treating wastewater comprising the steps of:
 a) contacting the composition as defined in  claim 1  with a wastewater having an original chemical oxygen demand (COD) to form a wastewater: granules mixture;   b) incubating the mixture to achieve a 50% decrease of the original COD to obtain a treated wastewater;   c) separating said granules from said treated wastewater.   
 
     
   21 - 23 . (canceled) 
 
     
   24 . The process of  claim 20 , wherein said incubating of step b) is carried out with the introduction of an oxygen-containing gas with or without mixing. 
 
     
   25 - 27 . (canceled) 
 
     
   28 . The process of  claim 20 , wherein said step b) is carried out until COD is reduced by at least about 60%. 
 
     
   29 . The process of  claim 28 , wherein said step b) is carried out until COD is reduced by at least about 70%. 
 
     
   30 . The process of  claim 20 , carried out at a temperature from about 10 to about 50° C.
