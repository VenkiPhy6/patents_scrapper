 3.    The isolated strain of claim 2, wherein the isolated strain is selected from Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus animalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, or Lactobacillus curvatus.  
 
     
 4.    The isolated strain of claim 3, wherein the isolated strain is selected from Lactobacillus reuteri strain WF-1 IDAC Accession number 181218-01;  Lactobacillus animalis strain WF-2 IDAC Accession number 181218-02;  Enterococcus faecium strain WF-3 IDAC Accession number 181218-03;  Lactobacillus plantarum strain WF-4 IDAC Accession number 181218-04;  Lactobacillus brevis strain WF-5 IDAC Accession number 181218-05;  Lactobacillus curvatus strain WF-6 IDAC Accession number 181218-06;  Lactobacillus reuteri strain WF-7 IDAC Accession number 181218-07; or mutant strains therefrom, wherein the mutant strains are capable of binding canine cells.  
 
     
 5.    A composition comprising at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria isolated from feces of a free ranging wolf, wherein the at least one isolated strain is capable of binding canine cells.  
 
     
 6.    The composition of claim 5, further comprising one or more of a prebiotic, an additional pharmaceutical or nutritional ingredient, or a pharmaceutically or nutritionally acceptable excipient.    AMENDED SHEET (ARTICLE 19)  
 
     
 7.    The composition of claim 5, wherein the composition is in the form of a dietary supplement.  
 
     
 8.    The composition of claim 5, wherein the composition is in the form of a food product.  
 
     
 9.    The composition of claim 8, wherein the food product comprises a dog food or a dog treat.  
 
     
 10.    The composition of claim 5, wherein the at least one isolated strain of probiotic bacteria is selected from a Lactobacillus species or an Enterococcus species.  
 
     
 11.    A method for preparing a composition comprising: providing at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria isolated from feces of a free ranging wolf, wherein the at least one isolated strain is capable of binding canine cells; providing at least one ingredient; and combining the at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria and the at least one ingredient.  
 
     
 12.    The method of claim 11, wherein the at least one ingredient is an edible ingredient.  
 
     
 13.    The method of claim 11, wherein the at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria is provided in the form of a powder or a liquid.

 15.    A method for treating or preventing intestinal dysbiosis in a subject comprising administering at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria isolated from feces of a free ranging wolf to the subject, wherein the subject is a domestic dog and the at least one isolated strain is capable of binding canine cells.  
 
     
 16.    The method of claim 15, wherein the at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria is administered orally, enterally, or rectally.  
 
     
 17.    The method of claim 15, wherein the at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria is selected from a Lactobacillus species or an Enterococcus species.  
 
     
 18.    Use of at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria isolated from feces of a free ranging wolf in the preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing intestinal dysbiosis in a subject, wherein the subject is a domestic dog and the at least one isolated strain is capable of binding canine cells.  
 
     
 19.    The use of claim 18, wherein the at least one isolated strain of wolf probiotic bacteria is selected from a Lactobacillus species or an Enterococcus species.
