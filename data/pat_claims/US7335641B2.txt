A method for stimulating hair follicle cell proliferation in a subject, said method comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising a polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of amino acids 69 to 208 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein Glu 87 is optionally replaced by Asp 87. 
 
     
 2. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the polypeptide has the amino acid sequence of amino acids 69 to 208 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein Glu 87 is optionally replaced by Asp 87. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the composition is a topically administered composition. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the topically administered composition is selected from the group consisting of solution, cream, ointment, gel, and lotion. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 4 , wherein the composition comprises the polypeptide in an amount of about 0.1 to about 100 ng/mL of the topically administered composition. 
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the composition is administered through the use of a transdermal patch. 
 
     
 7. A method for treating, or ameliorating alopecia in a subject, said method comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising a polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of amino acids 69 to 208 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein Glu 87 is optionally replaced by Asp 87. 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 7 , wherein the polypeptide has the amino acid sequence of amino acids 69 to 208 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein Glu 87 is optionally replaced by Asp 87. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 8 , wherein the composition is a topically administered composition. 
 
     
 10. The method of  claim 9 , wherein the topically administered composition is selected from the group consisting of solution, cream, ointment, gel, and lotion. 
 
     
 11. The method of  claim 10 , wherein the composition comprises the polypeptide in an amount of about 0.1 to about 100 ng/mL of the topically administered composition. 
 
     
 12. The method of  claim 7 , wherein the composition is administered through the use of a tranadermal patch.
