 10.    The composition or composition for use as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, further comprising a prebiotic or a second prebiotic if the one or more oligosaccharides comprise a prebiotic.  
 
     
 11.    A method of producing the composition or composition for use of any one of claims 1 to 9, comprising mixing the strain of Lactobacilli with the one or more oligosaccharides in a biologically effective amount; wherein the strain comprises Lactobacillus plantarum 2830 (ECGC 13110402).
