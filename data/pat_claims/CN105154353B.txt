It is characterized in that, the bacillus subtilis（Bacillus Subtilis）XHS0035Kc deposit numbers are CGMCC
NO.9434。 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. bacillus subtilis as described in claim 1（Bacillus Subtilis）XHS0035Kc, which is characterized in that described
Bacillus subtilis（Bacillus Subtilis）The gene order of the 16s of XHS0035Kc such as SEQ ID NO:Shown in 1. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. bacillus subtilis as described in claim 1（Bacillus Subtilis）XHS0035Kc is in greenhouse soil
Application in reparation. 
 
     
 4. a kind of greenhouse soil remediation group agent, which is characterized in that the greenhouse soil remediation group agent passes through as follows
Preparation method obtains： 
 （1）Inoculation：Prepare bacillus subtilis（Bacillus Subtilis）XHS0035Kc CGMCC NO.9434, fluorescence are false
Monad, gel-shaped bacillus and the solid medium for locking shadow yeast four kinds of strains of bacterium, strictly carry out sterile behaviour after sterilizing
Make, is forwarded to tablet from inclined-plane, is cultivated 3 days at 28 DEG C of temperature； 
 （2）Level-one culture：From step（1）In solid medium on picking single bacterium colony be forwarded to the 50mL equipped with fluid nutrient medium
In conical flask, sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min cultures -48h for 24 hours； 
 （3）Second order fermentation：By above-mentioned steps（2）Level-one culture strain is inoculated in the 500mL conical flasks for filling fluid nutrient medium,
Sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min cultures -48h for 24 hours； 
 （4）The compatibility of strain fermentating liquid：It is assessed according to weight part ratio, optional step（3）The bacillus subtilis of preparation
（Bacillus Subtilis）70 parts -80 parts of XHS0035Kc CGMCC NO.9434 second order fermentations liquid, Pseudomonas fluorescens two
20 parts -40 parts of zymotic fluid of grade, 25 parts -45 parts of gel-shaped bacillus second order fermentation liquid and lock shadow yeast bacterium second order fermentation liquid 15
- 35 parts of part is mixed, and the mixed liquor of composite bacteria is prepared； 
 （5）Add auxiliary material：By step（4）The composite bacteria mixed liquor of preparation is fully adsorbed in carrier, and carrier selects greenhouse big
Canopy soil；Auxiliary material uses urea and calcium superphosphate, and the wherein weight ratio of urea and calcium superphosphate is 1:2.5；Carrier and auxiliary material
Dosage is 1 according to weight ratio:3 proportioning mixing, add water to water content 40-70%, then every cubic metre of carrier and auxiliary material by volume
It mixes materials and above-mentioned steps is added（4）The composite bacteria mixed liquor 100-300g of preparation, and be uniformly mixed, it is big to prepare greenhouse
Canopy soil remediation group agent. 
 
     
 
   
 
 5. the application method of greenhouse soil remediation group agent as claimed in claim 4, which is characterized in that the application method
Steps are as follows：Greenhouse soil remediation group agent prepared by claim 4 composting at 20-30 DEG C of air themperature；Composting is
Carried out in the case where covering straw screen or mat, it is primary that composting starts rear every turning in 30 days, when turning moisturizing hold to water content 40-70%, composting time
It is 120 days continuous；Soil can be directly applied to after the completion of composting after airing to drying. 
 
     
 
   
 
 6. application of the greenhouse soil remediation group agent as claimed in claim 4 in greenhouse soil remediation.
