 1. A method of inhibiting the activity of the PTHrPl-173 isoform comprising the step of administrating an effective amount of a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds with an epitope of a C-terminal portion of the PTHrP 1-173 iso form, the C-terminal portion consisting of amino acid residues 151 to 169. 
 
     
 2. An isolated antibody capable of binding to an epitope of a C-terminal portion of the PTHrPl-173 isoform, the C-terminal portion consisting of amino acid residues 151 to 169, wherein the antibody is a humanized monoclonal antibody. 
 
     
 3. The antibody of claim 2, wherein the antibody is linked to a therapeutic agent selected from the group consisting of a cytotoxic agent, prodrug, drug and combinations thereof. 
 
     
 4. The antibody of claim 2, wherein the antibody is linked to a diagnostic agent selected from the group consisting of an enzyme, a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound and combinations thereof. 
 
     
 5. A monoclonal antibody derived from the hybridoma deposited with the International Depository Authority of Canada (“IDAC”) under Accession Number 150807-01. 
 
     
 6. The hybridoma deposited with the International Depository Authority of Canada (“IDAC”) under Accession Number 150807-01.
