 15. The isolated Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain deposited under International Depository Authority of Canada Accession number IDAC 200704-04.  
 
     
 16. An antifungal composition comprising bacteria of at least one isolated Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain which has suppressive activity against Pythium ultimum.  
 
     
 17. The composition according to claim 16 wherein the at least one Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain has suppressive activity against Pythium sp. "group G".  
 
     
 18. The composition according to claim 17 wherein the strain inhibits the colonization of Pythium sp. "group G" on an agar plate.  
 
     
 19. The composition according to claim 16 comprising one or more biologically inert components.  
 
     
 20. The composition according, to claim 19 wherein the one or more inert component is selected from the group consisting of carrier materials, stickers, binders, adhesives, extenders, and mixtures thereof.  
 
     
 21. The composition according to claim 19 comprising cells or spores of other biological control agents, one or more chemical fungicides, or one or more pesticides.  
 
     
 22. The composition according to claim 16 wherein the bacteria strain is the Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain deposited under International Depository Authority of Canada Accession number IDAC 200704-01.  
 
     
 23. The composition according to claim 16 wherein the bacteria strain is the Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain deposited under International Depository Authority of Canada Accession number IDAC 200704-02.  
 
     
 24. The composition according to claim l6 wherein the bacteria strain is the Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain deposited under International Depository Authority of Canada Accession number IDAC 200704-03.  
 
     
 25. The composition according to claim 16 wherein the bacteria strain is the Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain deposited under International Depository Authority of Canada Accession number IDAC: 200704-04.
