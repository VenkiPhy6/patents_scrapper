2, which is characterized in that the lactobacillus（ Lactobacillus sp. ）WTMX-2 deposit numbers are CGMCC No.14605. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. being suitable for the lactobacillus of the compoiste fermented drink of fermented grape seed chick-pea as described in claim 1
（ Lactobacillus sp. ）The gene order of WTMX-2 such as SEQ ID NO:Shown in 1. 
 
     
 3. one kind is by lactobacillus（ Lactobacillus sp. ）Grape pip chick-pea prepared by WTMX-2 CGMCC No.14605
Compoiste fermented drink, which is characterized in that method acquisition is prepared by the following procedure： 
 （1）The activation of strain：The lactobacillus that will be preserved at 4 DEG C（ Lactobacillus sp. ）WTMX-2 CGMCC No.
14605 are inoculated in MRS culture mediums in an aseptic environment, are placed in 37 DEG C of cultures for 24 hours, constant-temperature preserving is spare； 
 （2）Grape pip pre-processes：Screening particle is complete, the high-quality grapes seed of free from insect pests, and 600 W bakings are put into after cleaning-drying
After environment 1-2 min, store at room temperature spare； 
 （3）Chick-pea pre-processes：Full grains are selected, without the chick-pea gone mouldy, a concentration of 0.3% sodium bicarbonate of use quality is molten
Liquid impregnates 12 h, and tissue is made fully to soften, and is conducive to mashing；Clear water cleans raw material, cleans 3-5 times, peels off crust；Room temperature
Lower storage is spare； 
 （4）The preparation of grape pip olecranon fermented bean drink mixed liquor：By mass percentage, respectively by 5.8% the step of（2）The Portugal of acquisition
Grape seed and step（3）The chick-pea of acquisition is uniformly mixed, and pure water mashing is added, is saved backup at room temperature after filtering； 
 （5）The preparation of female zymotic fluid：By volume percentage, the step of by 10%（4）Obtained grape pip olecranon fermented bean drink mixed liquor
It is sub-packed in round, it aseptically, will be by step（1）The lactobacillus of activation（ Lactobacillus sp. ）
WTMX-2 CGMCC No. 14605 by 3% inoculative proportion access round in, condition of culture be 37 DEG C culture for 24 hours, constant temperature protect
It hides spare； 
 （6）Fermentation：By step（5）The lactobacillus of preparation（ Lactobacillus sp. ）WTMX-2 CGMCC No. 14605 are sent out
Step is added in zymotic fluid（4）In the 90% grape pip olecranon fermented bean drink mixed liquor of residue of preparation, -72h for 24 hours is cultivated at 37 DEG C, fermentation is eventually
Point is set as：It measures total acid and reaches 33.10 ° of T, pH value reaches 3.30； 
 （7）Post-processing：After product to fermentation termination, flash distillation sterilization carries out sterile filling preparation after compoiste fermented drink cooling
Obtain grape pip chick-pea composite fermentation drink.
