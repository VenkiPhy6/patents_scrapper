   8 . A process for the production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) comprising contacting the microorganism of  claim 1  with a source of glycerol under conditions for the formation of 1,3-PD and, optionally, isolating the 1,3-PD. 
 
     
   9 . The process of  claim 8 , wherein the conditions for the formation of 1,3-PD comprise culturing the microorganism in the presence of a source of glycerol and other substances for the conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PD by the microorganism. 
 
     
   10 . The process of  claim 8 , wherein the source of glycerol is by-products from biodiesel and ethanol production. 
 
     
   11 . The process of  claim 9 , wherein the source of glycerol and other substances for the conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PD is thin stillage or distiller's solubles. 
 
     
   12 . The process of  claim 9 , wherein the other substances for the conversion of glycerol to 1,3-PD by the microorganism comprise a food source for the microorganism. 
 
     
   13 . The process of  claim 8 , wherein the isolation of 1,3-PD is by distillation.
