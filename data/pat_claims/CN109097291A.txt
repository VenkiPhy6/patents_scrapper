18h-24h； 
 (2) it level-one culture: from picking single colonie on the solid medium in step (1), is switched to equipped with fluid nutrient medium
50mL conical flask in, sterile working, pichia kudriavzevii ( Pichia kudriavzevii ) F0-N475-5
CGMCC No.15772 and saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) GTGM-E2 CGMCC No.7513 are in 28 DEG C of temperature, 120r/
Min cultivates 18h-24h； 
 (3) above-mentioned steps level-one culture strain second order fermentation: is inoculated in the 500mL taper for filling cabernet sauvignon grape juice respectively
In bottle, sterile working, pichia kudriavzevii ( Pichia kudriavzevii ) F0-N475-5 CGMCC
No.15772 and saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ) GTGM-E2 CGMCC No.7513 28 DEG C of temperature, 120r/min train
Support -48h for 24 hours； 
 (4) compatibility of composite fermentation group agent: according to volume basis, optional step (3) preparation number be F0-N475-5 Ku De
Li Aziwei Pichia pastoris ( Pichia kudriavzevii ) second order fermentation liquid and saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ) GTGM-
E2 second order fermentation liquid is mixed according to volume ratio 1:1, prepares composite fermentation group agent. 
 
     
 
   
 
 6. the preparation method of composite fermentation group agent as claimed in claim 5, which is characterized in that in the composite fermentation group agent,
Pichia kudriavzevii ( Pichia kudriavzevii ) F0-N475-5CGMCC No.15772 and saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S.    cerevisiae ) GTGM-E2 CGMCC No.7513 culture medium be YPD culture medium, the preparation method comprises the following steps: glucose 20g, egg
White peptone 20g, yeast extract 10g, agar 20g, moisturizing to 1000mL dispense, and sterilizing can prepare YPD culture medium. 
 
     
 
   
 
 7. the method that Cabernet Sauvignon desiccation wine is brewed in composite fermentation group agent as claimed in claim 3, which is characterized in that the brew
Method and step is as follows: 
 (1) selection of desiccation grape liquor raw material: high-quality cabernet sauvignon grape is selected, picking is postponed after full maturity, by Cabernet Sauvignon Portugal
Grape Delayed harvest carries out nature desiccation, and raw material strictly sorted, it is desirable that the neat maturation of fruit ear, tinctorial yield are up to 100%, when picking
Grape soluble solid content is 45Brix； 
 (2) destemming of grape is broken: the grape of select through artificial destemming, is carried out broken taking juice with spiral juice extractor； 
 (3) alcoholic fermentation of desiccation grape wine: to cabernet sauvignon grape after the desiccation for carrying out destemming break process, it is input to fermentor
In, it is uniformly added into food-grade potassium metabisulfite and pectase respectively, the additive amount of food-grade potassium metabisulfite is with SO 2 It is calculated as
50mg/L, the additive amount of pectase are 0.02g/L；Select F0-N475-5 pichia kudriavzevii ( Pichia    kudriavzevii ) second order fermentation liquid and saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ) GTGM-E2 second order fermentation liquid carries out according to 1:1
The composite fermentation group agent being mixed with carries out alcoholic fermentation, and composite ferment inoculum concentration is 2%, and temperature is controlled at 25-28 DEG C, and
Circulation dipping, monitoring pol variation are carried out daily； 
 (4) malic-lactic acid fermentation of desiccation grape wine: after main fermentation, SO is added 2 To 30mg/L, pays attention to freshening the drink in time, guarantee
Malo-lactic fermentation is carried out under canful, air-proof condition, temperature is maintained at 20 ± 2 DEG C, and the time is 1 month, determines apple when detecting
At the end of milk fermentation, fermentation, cryo-conservation are terminated； 
 (5) desiccation grape hotel catering: being placed in ageing in tank for former wine after malic-lactic acid fermentation, and environment temperature is maintained at 14-16 DEG C, wet
Degree is maintained at 70-80%, periodically adds former wine and is in full cylinder state, dissociate SO 2 Content is maintained at 25-35mg/L, and the ageing phase is 6-
12 months； 
 (6) go out bucket, bottling and the bottle of desiccation grape wine store up: after desiccation Grape Wine Aging, determine bucket after tasting, it is former after bucket out
Wine carries out after clarification egg-white powder clarifying treatment is added, bottling bottle storage, and bottle storage phase environment temperature control is in 12-15 DEG C, humidity
70%-80%, and illumination is avoided, bottle stores up the phase as 12-24 months or more. 
 
     
 
   
 
 8. the method that Cabernet Sauvignon desiccation wine is brewed in composite fermentation group agent as claimed in claim 7 brews the Cabernet Sauvignon desiccation obtained
Wine.
