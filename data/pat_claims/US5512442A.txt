 1. A method for detecting VAP-1 in bodily fluid from a patient, wherein said VAP-1 specifically binds monoclonal antibody 1B2 (DSM ACC2041), comprising: (1) removing a sample of the bodily fluid from the patient;   (2) exposing said sample to a VAP-1-specific antibody; and   (3) detecting VAP-1-specific antibody binding to VAP-1 present in said sample.   
 
     
 2. The method claim 1, where said sample is obtained from a source selected from the group consisting of plasma, serum and synovial fluid. 
 
     
 3. The method of claim 1, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is a polyclonal antibody. 
 
     
 4. The method of claim 1, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is a monoclonal antibody. 
 
     
 5. The method of claim 4, wherein said monoclonal antibody is 1B2 (DSM ACC2041). 
 
     
 6. The method of claim 1, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is raised against an immunogen selected from the group consisting of synovial stroma, the 170 kD form of VAP-1 wherein said 170 kD VAP-1 specifically binds monoclonal antibody 1B2 (DSM ACC2041), the 90 kD form of VAP-1 wherein said 90 kD VAP-1 specifically binds the monoclonal antibody 1B2 (DSM ACC2041) and a mimotope of VAP-1. 
 
     
 7. The method of claim 6, wherein said antibody is raised against a mimotope of VAP-1 derived from N-terminus of the mouse cyclophilin C associated protein. 
 
     
 8. The method of claim 7, wherein said N-terminus has the amino acid sequence LVNGASANEG. 
 
     
 9. The method of claim 8, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is monoclonal antibody 5B11 (DSM ACC2237). 
 
     
 10. A method for diagnosing a medical condition in a patient that is mediated by VAP-1-mediated binding of endothelial cells to lymphocytes, wherein said VAP-1 specifically binds monoclonal antibody 1B2 (DSM ACC2041), said method comprising: (1) removing cells from said patient suspected of being VAP-1 positive cells;   (2) exposing said cells of step (1) to a VAP-1-specific antibody;   (3) detecting VAP-1-specific antibody binding to said VAP-1 positive cells; and   (4) diagnosing said medical condition on the basis of the amount of said binding.   
 
     
 11. The method of claim 10, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is a polyclonal antibody. 
 
     
 12. The method of claim 10, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is a monoclonal antibody. 
 
     
 13. The method of claim 12, wherein said monoclonal antibody is 1B2 (DSM ACC2041). 
 
     
 14. The method of claim 10, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is raised against an immunogen selected from the group consisting of synovial stroma, the 170 kD form of VAP-1 wherein said 170 Kd VAP-1 specifically binds monoclonal antibody 1B2 (DSM ACC2041), the 90 kD form of VAP-1 wherein said 90 kD VAP-1 specifically binds monoclonal antibody 1B2 (DSM ACC2041) and a mimotope of VAP-1. 
 
     
 15. The method of claim 14, wherein said antibody is raised against a mimotope of VAP-1 derived from the N-terminus of the mouse cyclophilin C associated protein. 
 
     
 16. The method of claim 15, wherein said N-terminus has the amino acid sequence LVNGASANEG. 
 
     
 17. The method of claim 16, wherein said VAP-1-specific antibody is monoclonal antibody 5B11 (DSM ACC2237). 
 
     
 18. The method of claim 10, wherein said medical condition is a chronic or acute infectious or inflammatory disease selected from the group consisting of arthritis, dermatosis, inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune disease. 
 
     
 19. The method of claim 18, wherein said medical condition is rheumatoid arthritis. 
 
     
 20. The method of claim 18, wherein said medical condition is an inflammatory bowel disease selected from the group consisting of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. 
 
     
 21. The method of claim 18, wherein said medical condition is a dermatosis selected from the group consisting of psoriasis, atopic eczema and lichen ruber planus.
