 1. A recombinant expression vector designated pMJ12 which directs the expression of Phytolacca antiviral protein in microorganisms. 
 
     
 2. E. coli HB101(KCCM 10037) transformed with the recombinant expression vector of claim 1, which produces Phytolacca antiviral protein. 
 
     
 3. A process for preparing Phytolacca antiviral protein, which comprises the steps of: (i) culturing transformed E. coli HB101 (KCCM 10037) cells under conditions suitable for induction of said antiviral protein; (ii) harvesting said induced cells; (iii) lysing said induced cells to produce a lysate, and centrifuging said lysate to produce a pellet and a surpernatant; and (iv) purifying said antiviral protein from said supernatant.
