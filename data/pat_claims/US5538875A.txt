 1. A process for the production of pyruvic acid comprising the steps of reacting, in an aqueous solution and at a pH of from 6 to 10 with or without a buffer, L-lactic acid at an initial concentration of from 0.25M to 2.0M and oxygen in the presence of a permeabilized whole cell catalyst selected from the group consisting of transformants of Hansenula polymorpha and Pichia pastoris, wherein the transformant expresses glycolate oxidase and catalase enzymes, to convert the L-lactic acid to pyruvic acid, and then recovering the pyruvic acid. 
 
     
 2. The process of claim 1 wherein said permeabilized whole cell catalyst is selected from the group consisting of the transformant Hansenula polymorpha GO1 deposited under NRRL No. Y-21065 and the transformant Pichia pastoris GS115-MSP10 deposited under NRRL No. Y-21001 wherein the transformant expresses glycolate oxidase and catalase enzymes. 
 
     
 3. The process of claim 1 wherein the glycolate oxidase and catalase are present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of 0.01 to 1,000 IU/mL and from 500 to 50,000 IU/mL respectively. 
 
     
 4. The process of claim 3 wherein the glycolate oxidase and catalase are present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of 0.1 to 10 IU/mL and 2,000 to 15,000 IU/mL respectively, and the IU/mL ratio of catalase to glycolate oxidase is at least 250:1. 
 
     
 5. The process of claim 1 wherein the initial concentration of L-lactic acid is from 0.25M to 1.0M. 
 
     
 6. The process of claim 5 wherein the glycolate oxidase and catalase are present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of 0.01 to 1,000 IU/mL and from 500 to 50,000 IU/mL, respectively. 
 
     
 7. The process of claim 5 wherein the glycolate oxidase and catalase are present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of 0.1 to 10 IU/mL and 2,000 to 15,000 IU/mL, respectively, and the IU/mL ratio of catalase to glycolate oxidase is at least 250:1. 
 
     
 8. The process of claim 1 wherein a buffer is used. 
 
     
 9. The process of claim 1 without a buffer. 
 
     
 10. The process of claim 2 without a buffer.
