A method of preparing a replication competent chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara deletion variant (dCVA), said method comprising: (a)    providing a vector comprising the genome of a chorioallantois vaccinia Ankara (CVA); (b)    deleting the sequences corresponding to .cndot.    del I (positions 4052-7465 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del II (positions 23139-25884 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del III (positions 158867-162413 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del IV (positions 180639-187092 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del V (positions 17438-22159 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); and .cndot.    del VI (positions 135481-139264 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); and (c)      isolating the dCVA, wherein the dCVA replication is measured in a 293, 143B or MRC-5 human cell line.  
 
     
 2.    The method of claim 1, which further comprises the step of measuring the amplification ratio of said dCVA in a human cell line.  
 
     
 3.    The chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara deletion variant (dCVA) obtained by the method defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein the dCVA replicates with an amplification ratio of greater than 5 in the human cell line 293, 143B, or MRC-5.  
 
     
 4.    A vector comprising the genome of the dCVA defined in claim 3.  
 
     
 5.    A cell comprising the genome of the dCVA defined in claim 3.  
 
     
 6.    A method for determining the effect of a mutation on replication of a chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara deletion variant (dCVA) comprising: (a)      providing a vector comprising the genome of a CVA from which the sequences corresponding to .cndot.    del I (positions 4052-7465 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del II (positions 23139-25884 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del III (positions 158867-162413 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del IV (positions 180639-187092 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); .cndot.    del V (positions 17438-22159 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901); and .cndot.    del VI (positions 135481-139264 of GenBank AM501482; ECACC  10062901), are deleted, (b) introducing at least one mutation into the dCVA genome in order to obtain a mutated CVA deletion variant (mdCVA); and (c)    determining whether the mutation affects the replication of said mdCVA.  
 
     
 7.    The method of claim 6, which further comprises the step(s) of (d)(i) measuring the amplification ratio of said dCVA in a human cell line;  (ii) measuring the amplification ratio of mdCVA in said human cell line; or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).  
 
     
 8.    The method of claim 7, further comprising (e) comparing the amplification ratio of said dCVA with the amplification ratio of said mdCVA in order to determine whether the at least one mutation affects the replication of said mdCVA in said human cell line.  
 
     
 9.    The method of any one of claims 6 to 8, further comprising (f) determining whether the at least one mutation affects (i) the replication of the dCVA;  (ii) the pathogenicity of the dCVA; (iii) the immunogenicity of the dCVA; or (iv) a combination of at least two of (i) to (iii), in an animal.  
 
     
 10.    A method of preparing a mutated chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara deletion mutant (mdCVA) comprising: (a)    providing the dCVA defined in claim 3; (b)    introducing at least one mutation into the genome of said dCVA; and (c)    isolating the mdCVA.  
 
     
 11.    The method of claim 10, which further comprises the step of (d) (i) measuring the amplification ratio of said dCVA in a human cell line; (ii) measuring the amplification ratio of mdCVA in said human cell line; or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii).  
 
     
 12.    The method of claim 11, further comprising (e) comparing the amplification ratio of said dCVA with the amplification ratio of said mdCVA in order to determine whether the at least one mutation affects the replication of said mdCVA in said human cell line.  
 
     
 13.    The method of any one of claims 10 to 12, wherein said mdCVA is replication restricted in a human cell line relative to the replication of said dCVA in said human cell line.
