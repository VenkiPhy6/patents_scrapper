 1. A promoter nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. 
 
     
 2. A recombinant vector comprising the promoter of  claim 1  which is operationally linked to a coding sequence of a target gene. 
 
     
 3. A host cell transformed with the recombinant vector of  claim 2 . 
 
     
 4. The host cell of  claim 3 , which belongs to genus  Corynebacterium.    
 
     
 5. The host cell of  claim 4 , which is  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM (Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms) 10831P, transformed with a recombinant vector comprising a promoter designated as SEQ ID NO: 1 operationally linked to a coding sequence of lysC gene. 
 
     
 6. The host cell of  claim 4 , which is  Corynebacterium glutamicum  KCCM (Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms) 10830P, transformed with a recombinant vector comprising a promoter designated as SEQ ID NO: 2 operationally linked to a coding sequence of lysC gene. 
 
     
 7. A method of expressing a target gene, the method comprising culturing a host cell according to  claim 3 . 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 7 , wherein the target gene is lysC gene. 
 
     
 9. A method of expressing a target gene, the method comprising culturing a host cell according to  claim 4 . 
 
     
 10. A method of expressing a target gene, the method comprising culturing a host cell according to  claim 5 . 
 
     
 11. A method of expressing a target gene, the method comprising culturing a host cell according to  claim 6 . 
 
     
 12. The method of  claim 9 , wherein the target gene is lysC gene. 
 
     
 13. The method of  claim 10 , wherein the target gene is lysC gene. 
 
     
 14. The method of  claim 11 , wherein the target gene is lysC gene.
