 2. A method of producing a high yield of xylitol using the  Candida tropicalis  mutant ara-89 (KCTC 11136bp) of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 2 , which comprises culturing the mutant under fully aerobic conditions without a separate process of controlling dissolved oxygen concentration to a low level of 0.5-2%, in which the culture is carried out using a biomass hydrolyzate as a substrate. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the culture is performed through fed-batch culture using, as a feeding solution, a mixture of the biomass hydrolyzate and a carbon source. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the biomass hydrolyzate is a corncob hydrolyzate, a sugarcane bagasse hydrolyzate, a coconut byproduct or a hydrolyzate of  Betula platyphylla  var.  japonica.    
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 4 , wherein the carbon source is glycerol. 
 
     
 7. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the culture is higher than 5%.
