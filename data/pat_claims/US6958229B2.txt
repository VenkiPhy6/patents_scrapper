 (1) culturing a microrganism belonging to the genus  Mortierella  and subgenus  Mortierella  that is strain SAM 2197 FERM BP-6261 , in a medium having a carbon source concentration of at least 4% by weight at the start of culturing and the addition of at least an additional 6% by weight of carbon source during the culturing, thereby forming arachidonic acid or a lipid containing arachidonic acid;  
 (2) collecting the cultured cells; and  
 (3) extracting arachidonic acid or a lipid containing arachidonic acid from the collected cells;  
 wherein the microganism produces arachidonic acid of at least about 7 g/L culture medium when cultured in a medium containing at least about 4% carbon source at the start of culturing and the addition of at least an additional 6% by weight of carbon source during the culturing, and at least about 2% nitrogen source at the start of culturing for 5 to 10 days with agitation and aeration.  
 
 
     
 2. The process for producing arachidonic acid or lipid containing arachidonic acid according to  claim 1 , wherein the carbon source concentration at the start of culturing is at least 8% by weight.
