manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in a haploid yeast of which the
diploid is practical baker's yeast. 
 
     
 A method for constructing an ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeast
through gene manipulation, comprising inserting a marker such as URA3 into
the ATH1 gene in a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's
yeast, to thereby disrupt said ATH1 gene. 
 
     
 A diploid or higher polyploid, frozen dough-resistant and
high-sugar dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast as produced through
mating with one or more ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts produced
through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in a haploid yeast
of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast. 
 
     
 An a/α-type, diploid, frozen dough-resistant and high-sugar
dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast as produced through mating of an
ATH1 gene-disrupted, a-type haploid yeast produced through gene
manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in an a-type haploid yeast, with
an ATH1 gene-disrupted, α-type haploid yeast produced through gene
manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in an α-type haploid yeast. 
 
     
 An a/α-type, diploid, frozen dough-resistant and high-sugar 
dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast as produced through mating of an
ATH1 gene-disrupted, a-type haploid yeast produced through gene
manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in an a-type haploid yeast of which
the diploid is practical baker's yeast, with an ATH1 gene-disrupted, α-type
haploid yeast produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1
gene in an α-type haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's
yeast. 
 
     
 A method for constructing a diploid or higher polyploid, frozen
dough-resistant and high-sugar dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast,
which comprises inserting a marker such as URA3 into the ATH1 gene in a
haploid yeast, of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast, to thereby
disrupt said ATH1 gene, followed by mating one or more of the resulting
ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts. 
 
     
 A frozen dough-resistant and high-sugar dough-resistant,
practical baker's yeast as produced through mass-culture of an a/α-type,
diploid, frozen dough-resistant and high-sugar dough-resistant, practical
baker's yeast produced through mating of an ATH1 gene-disrupted, a-type
haploid yeast produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1
gene in an a-type haploid yeast, with an ATH1 gene-disrupted, α-type haploid
yeast produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in 
an α-type haploid yeast. 
 
     
 Frozen dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast-containing,
frozen dough, as produced by preparing dough with a diploid or higher
polyploid, frozen dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast that is
produced through mating with one or more ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid
yeasts produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in
a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast, then
incubating it and thereafter freezing it. 
 
     
 High-sugar dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast-containing,
high-sugar dough, which comprises a diploid or higher
polyploid, high-sugar dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast that is
produced through mating with one or more ATH1 gene-disrupted, haploid
yeasts produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1 gene in
a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast. 
 
     
 Bread from frozen dough, which is produced by preparing dough
with a diploid or higher polyploid, frozen dough-resistant, practical
baker's yeast that is produced through mating with one or more ATH1
gene-disrupted, haploid yeasts produced through gene manipulation of
disrupting the ATH1 gene in a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical
baker's yeast, then incubating the dough, freezing it to give frozen 
dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast-containing frozen dough, thawing
the resulting frozen dough, fermenting it, and finally baking it. 
 
     
 Bread as produced by preparing high-sugar dough with a diploid
or higher polyploid, high-sugar dough-resistant, practical baker's yeast
that is produced through mating with one or more ATH1 gene-disrupted,
haploid yeasts produced through gene manipulation of disrupting the ATH1
gene in a haploid yeast of which the diploid is practical baker's yeast,
then fermenting the dough, and finally baking it.
