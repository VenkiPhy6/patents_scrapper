 1. A nystatin-resistant mutant strain Aspergillus terreus which is capable of producing at least 11.5g/L of triol heptanoic acid under a culture condition. 
 
 
 2. Aspergill us terreus CLS247-13 (KCTC 0672BP) which is capable of producing at least 11.5g/L of triol heptanoic acid under a culture condition and providing a high productivity of triol heptanoic acid (at least 11.5g/L, 95.6% of total product) while reducing productivity of triol heptanoic acid analogues (less than 0.53g/L, 4.4% of total product) . 
 
 
 3. A process for preparing triol heptanoic acid by aerobic culture of the mutant strain Aspergillus terreus of claim 1 in a nutrient medium and obtaining triol heptanoic acid therefrom. 
 
 
 4. The process for preparing triol heptanoic acid of claim 3, wherein the nutrient medium contains a carbon source selected from the group consisting of lactose, dextrin, maltose, starch, soluble starch, fructose, sucrose, xylose, glucose, galactose and glycerol. 
 
 
 5. A process for preparing triol heptanoic acid by aerobic culture of the Aspergillus terreus CLS247-13 (KCTC 0672BP) of claim 2 in a nutrient medium and obtaining triol heptanoic acid therefrom. 
 
 
 6. The process for preparing triol heptanoic acid of claim 5, wherein Aspergillus terreus CLS247-13 (KCTC 0672BP) is cultured in a medium comprising carbon source, nitrogen source, anti-foaming agent, and inorganic substances at a temperature range of 25-36 Â° C under a pH condition of 5.5- 7.5.   
 
 
 7. The process for preparing triol heptanoic acid of claim 6, wherein the carbon source is selected from the group consisting of lactose, dextrin, maltose, starch, soluble starch, fructose, sucrose, xylose, glucose, galactose and glycerol . 
 
 
 8. The process for preparing triol heptanoic acid of claim 6, wherein the nitrogen source is selected from the group consisting of corn steep liquor, dried yeast, peptone casein, soy bean flour, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate. 
 
 
 9. The process for preparing triol heptanoic acid of claim 6, wherein the inorganic substance is selected from the group consisting of iron, manganese, copper, calcium, boron, molybdenium and zinc. 
 
 
 10. The process for preparing triol heptanoic acid of claim 6, wherein the anti-foaming agent is polypropylene glycol 2,000(PPG 2,000).
