 1. An isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ  ID  NO:2.  
 
     
 2. An isolated, immunogenic polypeptide fragment of OspC of Borrelia burgdorferi consisting essentially of an epitope of OspC of an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 3. The isolated polypeptide fragment of Claim 2, consisting of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 4. An isolated DNA molecule encoding a polypeptide consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 5. The isolated DNA molecule of Claim 4, consisting of a nucleotide sequence as shown in nucleotides 433-582 of SEQ ID NO:1.  
 
     
 6. The isolated DNA molecule of Claim 4, further consisting of a DraI  recognition site at its 5' terminus and a SmaI recognition site at its 3' terminus.  
 
     
 7. The isolated DNA molecule of Claim 4, comprising a nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:1.  
 
     
 8. An expression vector comprising an isolated DNA encoding a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ ID  NO:2.  
 
     
 9. A pharmaceutical composition to vaccinate against and to treat borrelia infection in a mammal, the composition comprising an amount of an isolated polypeptide consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ  ID NO:2, the amount being effective to prevent or to treat borrelia infection in mammals and a pharmaceutical carrier.  
 
     
 10. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 9, further comprising an adjuvant.  
 
     
 11. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 9, wherein the isolated polypeptide consists of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 12. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 11, further comprising an adjuvant.  
 
     
 13. Use of a pharmaceutically effective amount of an isolated polypeptide consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ  ID NO:2 to prevent or to treat borrelia infection in a patient.  
 
     
 14. The use of Claim 13, wherein said isolated polypeptide consists of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 15. The use of Claim 13, wherein said borrelia infection is an infection by Borrelia burgdorferi.  
 
     
 16. A method to detect borrelia infection in mammals, comprising: a) contacting a body fluid of a mammalian host suspected to suffer from borrelia infection with an isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ ID NO:2; and then b) determining whether the isolated polypeptide is conjugated to antibodies present in the body fluid of the mammalian host, whereby presence of conjugation indicates presence of borrelia infection in the host.  
 
     
 17. The method of Claim 16, wherein in step b) the presence of conjugation is detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  
 
     
 18. A kit for diagnosing borrelia infection in mammals, the kit comprising an isolated polypeptide consisting essentially of an amino acid sequence as shown in residues 145 to 194 of SEQ ID NO:2, disposed in a suitable container therefor, and instructions for use of the kit.  
 
     
 19. The kit of Claim 18, wherein the isolated polypeptide consists of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 20. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 9, wherein the mammal is human.  
 
     
 21. The use of Claim 13, wherein the patient is human.  
 
     
 22. The method of Claim 16, wherein the host is human.  
 
     
 23. The kit of Claim 18, wherein the mammal is human.
