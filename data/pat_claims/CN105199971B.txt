Sign is that the deposit number of the saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) JM33 is CGMCC
NO.10912。 
 
     
 2. a kind of wood receives lattice grape method for preparing medicated wine, which is characterized in that the wood receives lattice grape wine and method is prepared by the following procedure
It obtains： 
 (1) it is inoculated with：Prepare the YPD solids of saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) JM33CGMCC NO.10912
Culture medium strictly carries out sterile working after sterilizing, be forwarded to tablet from inclined-plane, cultivated 2 days at 28 DEG C of temperature； 
 (2) expand culture：It is forwarded to from picking single bacterium colony on the YPD solid mediums in step (1) equipped with YPD fluid nutrient mediums
Conical flask in, sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min culture -48h for 24 hours prepare seed liquor； 
 (3) collection of seed liquor：Seed liquor after step (2) is activated collects spare, turn of centrifugation through centrifuge washing after twice
Speed is 5000rpm； 
 (4) wood receives the selecting of lattice grape：Select it is ripe, without go mouldy, the wood without worm-eaten receives lattice grape, spare； 
 (5) processing of raw material：The wood of step (4) maturation is received after lattice grape extraction juice is crushed and collects grape juice, measures pol, packing
In common round, liquid amount is the 3/4 of round volume； 
 (6) it is inoculated with：It is separately added into the seed liquor of the step (3) after centrifuge washing according to the 3% of step (5) raw material volume, and
Temperature is fermented 10d under conditions of being 15 DEG C； 
 (7) it filters：Semi-finished product after step (6) is fermented utilize yarn or membrane filtration, go to allowance for bark and seed, filtered liquid fill
It is to prepare wood to receive lattice grape wine through precipitation glycolysis of fermenting later into container. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. a kind of wood receives the wood of lattice grape method for preparing medicated wine preparation and receives lattice grape wine as claimed in claim 2. 
 
     
 
   
 
 4. saccharomyces cerevisiae (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) JM33 as described in claim 1 receives lattice brewing grapes wood in wood
The application received in lattice grape wine.
