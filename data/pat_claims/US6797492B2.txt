 1. A method of producing a veneered immunoglobulin having the ligand binding properties of an immunoglobulin from a first mammalian species and having the immunogenic properties of reduced immunogenicity in a second mammalian species, the process comprising: 
 a) comparing a variable domain of the first species immunoglobulin with variable domains of immunoglobulins from the second species at corresponding framework amino acid sequences;  
 b) selecting from the variable domains of the second species immunoglobulins the variable domain which is most similar to the variable domain of the first species immunoglobulin at corresponding framework amino acid sequences;  
 c) identifying framework amino acid residues of the first species variable domain which differ from the amino acid residues at the corresponding position of the selected variable domain, these differing amino acid residues being limited to those determined to be exposed to solvent, which are not directly adjacent to a complementarity determining region; and  
 d) producing an immunoglobulin having the first species variable domain with only the identified amino acid residues identified in step c) being replaced with the corresponding residues present in the selected variable domain.  
 
     
 2. The method of  claim 1  wherein the first mammalian species is mouse. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 1  wherein the second mammalian species is human.
