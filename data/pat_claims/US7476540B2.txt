A monoclonal antibody specifically binding to a membrane protein antigen of human mesenchymal stem cells, which is produced by a hybridoma cell line as deposited with the Korean Cell Line Research Foundation under Accession Nos. KCLRF-BP-000123, KCLRF-BP-000124 or KCLRF-BP-000125. 
 
     
 2. A hybridoma cell line producing the monoclonal antibody of  claim 1 , which is deposited with the Korean Cell Line Research Foundation under Accession Nos. KCLRF-BP-000123, KCLRF-BP-000124 or KCLRF-BP-000125. 
 
     
 3. A method for identifying or isolating human mesenchymal stem cells, which comprises the steps of:
 (a) contacting a biosample to the monoclonal antibody of  claim 1 ; and 
 (b) detecting or isolating an antibody-antigen complex generated between the monoclonal antibody of  claim 1  and human mesenchymal stem cell present in the biosample.
