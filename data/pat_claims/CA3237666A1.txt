 [Claim 2] The Schizochytrium sp. microalgae according to claim 1, wherein the Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 microalgae have a producing ability of omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid.  
 
     
 [Claim 3] The Schizochytrium sp. microalgae according to claim 2, wherein the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).  
 
     
 [Claim 4] The Schizochytrium sp. microalgae according to claim 3, wherein the microalgae produce docosahexaenoic acid of 35 to 60 % by weight based on the total weight of the fatty acid.  
 
     
 [Claim 5] The Schizochytrium sp. microalgae according to claim 3, wherein the microalgae produce eicosapentaenoic acid of 0.1 to 2 % by weight based on the total weight of the fatty acid.  
 
     
 [Claim 6] Biomass derived from a Schizochytrium sp. microalgae, comprising the Schizochytrium CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 sp. microalgae of claim 1, a culture of the microalgae, a dried product of the culture, or a lysate of the dried product.  
 
     
 [Claim 7] A composition comprising the biomass derived from a Schizochytrium sp.  microalgae of claim 6, a concentrate or a dried product of the biomass, or an extract of the biomass.  
 
     
 [Claim 8] The composition according to claim 7, wherein the composition is a feed composition or a food composition.  
 
     
 [Claim 9] A method for producing biomass derived from a Schizochytrium sp. microalgae, comprising: 1) culturing the Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 microalgae of claim 1; and 2) recovering biomass containing docosahexaenoic acid from the microalgae, a dried product thereof, or a lysate thereof.  
 
     
 [Claim 10] The method for producing biomass derived from a Schizochytrium sp. microalgae according to claim 9, wherein the culturing is performed under a heterotrophic condition.  
 
     
 [Claim 11] CAN_DMS: \1005054280 Date Recue/Date Received 2024-05-07 The method for producing biomass according to claim 9, wherein the culturing is performed using a medium comprising a carbon source and a nitrogen source.  
 
     
 [Claim 12] The method for producing biomass according to claim 11, wherein the carbon source is one or more kinds selected from the group consisting of glucose, fructose, maltose, galactose, mannose, sucrose, arabinose, xylose and glycerol.  
 
     
 [Claim 13] The method for producing biomass according to claim 11, wherein the nitrogen source is i) any one or more of organic nitrogen sources selected from the group consisting of yeast extract, beef extract, peptone and tryptone, or ii) any one or more of inorganic nitrogen sources selected from the group consisting of ammonium acetate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate, urea and MSG (Monosodium glutamate).  
 
     
 [Claim 14] A method for producing bio-oil derived from a Schizochytrium sp. microalgae, comprising: 1) culturing the Schizochytrium sp. CD01-2147 microalgae of claim 1; and 2) recovering biomass containing docosahexaenoic acid from the microalgae, a dried product thereof, or a lysate thereof.
