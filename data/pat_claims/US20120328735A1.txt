   4 . The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the lactic acid bacterium is  Streptococcus thermophilus.    
 
     
   5 . The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the lactic acid bacterium is  Lactobacillus helveticus  CM4 strain (Accession Number: FERM BP-6060). 
 
     
   6 . The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the peptide is collected 3 to 96 hours after the start of the fermentation. 
 
     
   7 . A method for preparing a composition comprising a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 4 or 16, comprising fermenting animal milk or milk protein using at least one lactic acid bacterium and/or a treated product thereof and formulating the resultant fermented milk or the peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 4 or 16 collected therefrom. 
 
     
   8 . A composition comprising a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 4 or 16. 
 
     
   9 . A fermented milk composition, which is obtained by fermenting animal milk or milk protein using at least one lactic acid bacterium and/or a treated product thereof and which comprises a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 4 or 16. 
 
     
   10 . The composition according to  claim 9 , wherein the composition comprises 0.1 Î¼g/ml or more of the peptide. 
 
     
   11 . A food or drink comprising the composition according to  claim 8  incorporated thereinto. 
 
     
   12 . A supplement comprising the composition according to  claim 8  incorporated thereinto. 
 
     
   13 . A method for preparing a functional food or drink, comprising fermenting animal milk or milk protein using at least one lactic acid bacterium and/or a treated product thereof, and incorporating the resultant fermented milk or a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 4 or 16 obtained therefrom, into a food or drink. 
 
     
   14 . Use of at least one lactic acid bacterium or a treated product thereof for producing a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 4 or 16. 
 
     
   15 . A food or drink comprising the composition according to  claim 9  incorporated thereinto. 
 
     
   16 . A supplement comprising the composition according to  claim 9  incorporated thereinto.
