binding properties of an immunoglobulin from a first mammalian species
and the immunogenicity of an immunoglobulin from a second mammalian
species comprising:
   a. comparing a variable domain of
an immunoglobulin of the first mammalian species with the variable domains
immunoglobulins of the second mammalian species at corresponding
framework amino acid sequences;   b. selecting from the variable domains of the second mammalian
species the variable domain which is most similar to the
first mammalian species variable
domain at corresponding framework amino acid sequences;   c. identifying framework amino acid residues of the first
mammalian species vaxiable domain which differ from the amino acid
residues at the corresponding position of the variable domain selected in section
b, said differing amino acid residues being limited to those having a
fractional accessibility of at least 0.61
which are not adjacent to a complementarity-determining
region;   d. replacing only the amino acid residues identified in section c with
the corresponding residues present in the sequence selected in section b;   e. preparing a DNA sequence encoding the immunoglobulin
produced by section d;   f. inserting the RNA sequence into a replicable expression
vector operably linked to a suitable promoter compatible with a host cell;   g. transforming a host cell with the vector of section f;   h. culturing the host cell; and   i. recovering the immunoglobulin from the host cell culture.
