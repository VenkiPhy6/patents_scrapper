 1. A method for remediating contaminated soil, comprising:
 inoculating, soil which is contaminated with heavy metals, with a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain which includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 which produces urease. 
 
 
     
 2. The method of  claim 1 , further inoculating the soil with a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain which includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 which produces urease. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 1 , further inoculating the soil with a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain which includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 which produces urease. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain is isolated from acidic soil contaminated with heavy metals in an exhausted mine area. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 1 , further comprising spreading urea onto the soil prior to the inoculating step. 
 
     
 6. The composition for remediating contaminated soil of  claim 1 , further comprising a calcium agent. 
 
     
 7. The method of  claim 1 , comprising additionally providing urease to the soil. 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 7 , wherein the additionally provided urease is extracted from bean juice. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 1  wherein the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain inoculated in the soil produces urease which hydrolyzes urea in the soil in which generates a carbonate ion in which the carbonate ion reacts with a calcium ion in the soil to precipitate calcium carbonate, thereby stabilizing heavy metals in the soil and neutralizing a pH of the soil. 
 
     
 10. The method of  claim 1 , further comprising re-inoculating the soil with the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain after the inoculating step. 
 
     
 11. The method of  claim 10 , wherein the re-inoculating step is performed 72 hours after the inoculating step. 
 
     
 12. The method of  claim 10 , wherein the re-inoculating step is performed after 72 hours subsequent to the inoculating step. 
 
     
 13. A method for remediating contaminated soil, comprising:
 inoculating the soil with a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain, a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain, and a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain, wherein
 the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 
 the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and 
 the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3. 
 
 
 
     
 14. The method of  claim 13 , further comprising adding urea onto the soil. 
 
     
 15. The method of  claim 13 , further comprising providing urease onto the soil. 
 
     
 16. The method of  claim 13 , further comprising spreading calcium chloride onto the soil. 
 
     
 17. The method of  claim 13 , further comprising re-inoculating the soil with the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain, the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain, and the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain subsequent to the inoculating step. 
 
     
 18. The method of  claim 16 , wherein the re-inoculating step is performed 72 hours subsequent to the inoculating step. 
 
     
 19. The method of  claim 16 , wherein the re-inoculating step is performed after 72 hours subsequent to the inoculating step. 
 
     
 20. A method for remediating contaminated soil, comprising:
 inoculating the soil with a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain, a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain, and a  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain, wherein
 the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 
 the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and 
 the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain includes a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3; 
 
 adding urea onto the soil; 
 providing urease onto the soil; 
 spreading calcium chloride onto the soil; and 
 re-inoculating the soil with the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12800BP strain, the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12801BP strain, and the  Sporosarcina  sp. KCTC 12802BP strain subsequent to the inoculating step.
