 a) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14, 
 b) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16, 
 c) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28, 
 d) a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence being capable of hybridizing to at least one of the following polynucleotides 1) and 2)
 1) the polynucleotide which has a sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 28; 
 2) the polynucleotide which has a sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 27, 
 
 wherein the hybridization is under conditions comprising hybridizing a nitrocellulose filter in a solution of 5×SSCP, 50% formamide, 1×Denhardt solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 10% (W/V) dextran sulfate at a temperature of 28° C. for 18 hours, followed by washing two times in 2×SSCP containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and washing three times in 0.3×SSCP containing 0.1% SDS at a temperature of 37° C., 
 e) a polypeptide of a)-d), wherein the polypeptide is capable of binding to Fas antigen; and 
 f) a polypeptide of a)-d), wherein the polypeptide is obtained by recombinant technique and the polypeptide is capable of binding to Fas antigen.
