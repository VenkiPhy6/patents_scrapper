Step: 
 Keratinocyte is cultivated in (a) keratinocyte culture medium in culture dish； 
 B () removes described keratinocyte from described culture medium；And 
 C cell that () will be attached to bottom culture dish collects, then by the cell of collection at melanocyte culture medium or one-tenth
Cultivate in melanocyte culture medium； 
 Wherein, the melanocyte culture medium of described step (c) is the basal medium being added with fill-in, 
 Wherein, the basal medium of described melanocyte culture medium comprises necessity and non-essential amino acid, vitamin, organic compound
Thing, trace mineral and inorganic salt, but do not comprise antibiotic, antifungal, hormone, somatomedin or protein, 
 Wherein, the fill-in of described melanocyte culture medium comprises hyclone, basic fibroblast growth factor, Niu Chuiti
Extract, heparin, hydrocortisone, insulin, transferrins and 12-myristic acid-13-acetic acid phorbol (PMA)； 
 Or 
 Wherein, the melanoblast culture medium of described step (c) is to be added with the basal medium of fill-in, 
 Wherein, the basal medium of described melanoblast culture medium comprises necessity and non-essential amino acid, vitamin, organic
Compound, trace mineral and inorganic salt, but do not comprise antibiotic, antifungal, hormone, somatomedin or protein, 
 Wherein, the fill-in of described melanoblast culture medium comprises hyclone, basic fibroblast growth factor, cattle
Pituitary extract, heparin, hydrocortisone, insulin, transferrins and endothelin-1. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 1, it is characterised in that the keratinocyte behaviour cutin shape of described step (a)
Become cell. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 1, it is characterised in that described step (b) is included in keratinocyte culture medium
Interior addition calcium, forms calcium culture medium, is cultivated by keratinocyte in described calcium culture medium. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 3, it is characterised in that described step (b) comprises the following steps: 
 I () adds calcium in keratinocyte culture medium, form calcium culture medium, by the keratinocyte that is cultured described
Cultivate in calcium culture medium； 
 (ii) go deliming culture medium, clean described keratinocyte, replace described calcium by keratinocyte culture medium and cultivate
Keratinocyte described in base again culture； 
 (iii) remove described keratinocyte culture medium, clean described keratinocyte, then hatch described cutin and formed
Cell；And 
 (iv) from incubating cells, lamellar keratinocyte is isolated. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 4, it is characterised in that described step (iv) includes by adding in incubating cells
Buffer or keratinocyte culture medium isolate described lamellar keratinocyte. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 4, it is characterised in that described step (i) is to be cultivated at calcium by keratinocyte
Cultivating 2～6 days in base, described calcium culture medium is formed for adding calcium in keratinocyte culture medium. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 4, it is characterised in that described method includes: in step (a), when in cutin shape
The result becoming the described keratinocyte cultivated in cell culture medium make the cell cultivated on culture dish reach 80～
During 100% fusion rate, described keratinocyte culture medium is replaced by calcium culture medium. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 4, it is characterised in that in step (ii), cultivate at described keratinocyte
Cultivate described cell 3～7 days in base. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 4, it is characterised in that in step (iii), when described culture medium color no longer
Described culture medium is removed when changing. 
 
     
 
   
 
 Method the most according to claim 4, it is characterised in that described hatching carries out 5～10 minutes.
