 One or more acyltransferases are provided to the edible oil； 
 Acyl group is transferred to one or more acyl acceptors selected from sterol and stanols to form one or more esters from phosphatide； 
 Wherein, one or more acyltransferases have at least 5% acyltransferase activity, the lipid acyl
The amino acid sequence of transferase is shown in SEQ ID No.16 or obtained from aeromonas salmonicida (Aeromonas
Salmonnicida) and with SEQ ID No.16 amino acid sequence there is 98% or higher homogeneity, wherein, 
 (i) to be used as control without the edible oil for adding enzyme； 
 (ii) in the enzymatic reaction using edible oil, the lipid matter from the reaction and control is analyzed； 
 (iii) acyltransferase activity is calculated as to the percentage of total enzyme activity using following formula： 
 (A Χ 100)/((A+ Δ % aliphatic acid)/Mv aliphatic acid) 
 Wherein, 
 Δ % aliphatic acid=% aliphatic acid (enzyme)-% aliphatic acid (control), 
 The mean molecule quantity of Mv aliphatic acid=aliphatic acid, and 
 A=Δs % sterol esters/Mv sterol esters； 
 Wherein Δ % sterol esters=% sterol/stanol ester (enzyme)-% sterol/stanol ester (control), and 
 The mean molecule quantity of Mv sterol esters=sterol/stanol ester. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. the method for claim 1 wherein form sterol ester and/or stanol ester. 
 
     
 
   
   
 
 3. the method for claim 1 or 2, wherein the acyl acceptor is sterol. 
 
     
 
   
   
 
 4. 1 or 2 method in claim, wherein the phosphatide is lecithin. 
 
     
 
   
   
 
 5. 1 or 2 method in claim, wherein the acyltransferase is natural lipid acyltransferase. 
 
     
 
   
 
 6. claim 1 method, wherein the acyltransferase includes GDSX motifs. 
 
     
 
   
 
 7. the method for claim 6, wherein the X in the GDSX motifs is L. 
 
     
 
   
 
 8. the method for claim 1 wherein the amino acid sequence of the acyltransferase is SEQ ID No.16. 
 
     
 
   
   
 
 9. 1 or 2 method in claim, wherein there is the water less than 1% in edible oil described in processing procedure. 
 
     
 
   
 
 10. the method for claim 9, wherein there is the water less than 0.5%. 
 
     
 
   
 
 11. the method for claim 10, wherein there is the water less than 0.1%. 
 
     
 
   
   
 
 12. the method for claim 1 or 2, wherein this method are included by filtering removal by the effect of acyltransferase
