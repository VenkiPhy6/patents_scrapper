 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What is claimed is: 
   
 1. An isolated cDNA sequence coding for interleukin 5 receptor wherein the amino acid sequence comprises the sequence described in SEQ ID NO. 13 or 14. 
 
     
 2. The isolated cDNA sequence of claim 1 wherein the nucleotide sequence described in SEQ ID No. 9 comprises the open reading frame sequence coding for human interleukin 5 receptor. 
 
     
 3. The isolated cDNA sequence of claim 1 wherein the nucleotide sequence described in SEQ ID No. 10 comprises the entire sequence coding for human interleukin 5 receptor. 
 
     
 4. The isolated cDNA sequence of claim 1 wherein the nucleotide sequence described in SEQ ID No. 11 comprises the open reading frame sequence coding for human interleukin 5 receptor 2. 
 
     
 5. The isolated cDNA sequence of claim 1 wherein the nucleotide sequence described in SEQ ID No. 12 comprises the entire sequence coding for human interleukin 5 receptor 2. 
 
     
 6. The isolated cDNA sequence coding for secretory human interleukin 5 receptor which lacks a cytoplasmic region and has binding specificity for interleukin 5 and comprises amino acids 1 to 333 of SEQ ID NO. 13 or 14. 
 
     
 7. An expression vector comprising the cDNA sequence of any one of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
 
     
 8. A transfectant which is obtained by transfecting the expression vector of claim 7 into a host cell. 
 
     
 9. A method of producing a secretory human interleukin 5 receptor which comprises culturing a cell capable of expressing human interleukin 5 receptor having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acids 1 to 333 of SEQ ID NO. 13 or 14 in a medium and isolating the human interleukin 5 receptor from the culture supernatant using an interleukin 5 receptor antibody. 
 
     
 10. A method of producing a human interleukin 5 receptor, which comprises culturing a cell capable of expressing human interleukin 5 receptor having an amino acid sequence comprising amino acids 1 to 333 of SEQ ID NO. 13 or 14 in a medium and isolating the human interleukin 5 receptor from the cells or the culture supernatant.
