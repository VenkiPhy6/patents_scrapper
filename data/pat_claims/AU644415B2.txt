A mutant strain of a microorganism which belongs to any one genera of Escherichia, Bacillus, and Serratia, characterised in that a maximum glucose consumption rate thereof is at most 1/4 that of a corresponding wild strain, wherein the mutant is suitable for the production of biotin vitamins when transformed with a plasmid comprising a biotin operon originated from a microorganism which belongs to Escherichia. 
 
     
 2. A mutant strain according to claim 1, wherein said microorganism belongs to Escherichia. 
 
     
 3. A mutant strain according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein a feedback repression by biotin is removed. 
 
     
 4. A mutant strain according to any one of claims 1, 2 and 4 containing a recombinant plasmid with a biotin operon originated from a microorganism which belongs to Escherichia inserted in the vector DNA. A mutant strain according to claim 4, which is selected from the group consisting of DRG 024 [pXBA 312] strain, DRG 005 [pXBA 312] strain, DRG 014 [pXBA 312] strain, DRG 026 [pXBA 312] strain, and DRG 101 [pXBA 312] strain as herein defined. 
 
     
 6. A process for producing biotin characterised by cultivating the mutant strain of claim 4 in a nutrition medium, and then collecting biotin and/or desthiobiotin formed and accumulated in the culture broth. 
 
     
 7. Mutant microorganisms or methods for producing biotin substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the Examples. DATED this SECOND day of SEPTEMBER 1993 Shiseido Company Ltd.
