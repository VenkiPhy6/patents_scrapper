 1 . An isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus having IDAC  Accession number 120121-01.  
 
     
 2. A composition comprising (a) an isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus and (b) an inoculum carrier.  
 
     
 3. The composition of claim 2, wherein the inoculum carrier comprises biochar.  
 
     
 4. The composition of claim 3, wherein the biochar is coarse biochar.  
 
     
 5. The composition of any one of claims 2 to 4, further comprising a nutrient medium.  
 
     
 1 0    6. The composition of any one of claims 2 to 5, wherein the isolated bacterial strain produces Indole-3-acetic acid.  
 
     
 7. The composition of any one of claims 2 to 6, wherein the isolated bacterial strain produces siderophores and/or has nitrogen fixing ability.  
 
     
 8. The composition of any one of claims 2 to 7, wherein the isolated bacterial strain has IDAC      Accession number 120121-01.  
 
     
 9. The composition of any one of claims 2 to 8, wherein the nutrient medium comprises tryptone, sodium chloride and yeast extract.  
 
     
 10. The composition of any one of claims 2 to 9, further comprising at least one additional isolated bacterial strain with plant growth promoting activity.  
 
     
 11. A method of increasing the growth and/or pest resistance of a plant comprising inoculating the plant with (a) an isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus having IDAC  Accession number 120121-01, or (b) the composition of any one of claims 2 to 10, and growing the plant.  
 
     
 12. The method of claim 11, wherein a plant substrate proximate to the plant is inoculated with the isolated bacterial strain or the composition of any one of claims 2 to 10, thereby inoculating the plant with the isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus or the composition.  
 
     
 13. The method of claim 12, wherein the plant substrate proximate to the plant is soil.  
 
     
 14. The method of any one of claims 11 to 13, wherein the method further comprises inoculating the plant with at least one additional isolated bacterial strain having plant growth promoting activity.   Date Recue/Date Received 2021-01-21  
 
     
 15. The method of any one of claims 11 to 14, wherein increasing plant growth is measured as an increase in one or more of fruit weight, height of plant, height of stalk, fruit yield, ratio of head weight to shoot weight, and increased leaf area, compared to one or more control plants not inoculated with the isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus or the composition of any one of claims 2 to 10.  
 
     
 16. The method of any one of claims 11 to 14, wherein the pest resistance is measured as a decrease in pest damage as compared to one or more control plants not inoculated with the isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus or the composition of any one of claims 2 to 10.  
 
     
 17. The method of any one of claims 11 to 16, wherein the plant is a crop plant, optionally a cereal plant.  
 
     
 18. The method of claim 17, wherein the plant is a barley plant.  
 
     
 19. The method of any one of claims 11 to 16, wherein the plant is a fruit or vegetable plant.  
 
     
 20. The method of claim 19, wherein the plant is a broccoli, collard greens, carrots, bean, grape vine, strawberry, or blueberry plant.  
 
     
 21. A kit comprising a first container comprising an inoculum carrier, optionally biochar and a second container comprising an isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus.  
 
     
 22. The kit of claim 21, wherein the isolated bacterial strain of the genus Fictibacillus produces Indole-3-acetic acid, produces siderophores and/or has nitrogen fixing ability.  
 
     
 23. The kit of claim 21 or 22, wherein the isolated bacterial strain has IDAC  Accession number 120121-01.  
 
     
 24. The kit of any one of claims 21 to 23, further comprising a third container comprising a nutrient medium.  
 
     
 25. The kit of any one of claims 21 to 24, further comprising an additional container comprising at least one additional isolated bacterial strain with plant growth promoting activity.  
 
     
 26. The kit of any one of claims 21 to 25, further comprising a further container comprising a soil.  
 
     
 27. Use of the strain of claim 1, the composition of any one of claims 2 to 10 or the kit of any one of claims 21 to 26 to inoculate a plant.  
 
     
 28. The use of claim 27 wherein the plant is a barley, carrot, collard greens, bean, broccoli, strawberry, or blueberry plant.  
 
     
 29. The use of claim 27 or 28, wherein the plant is inoculated using the method of any one of claims 11 to 20.   Date Recue/Date Received 2021-01-21
