 1. Method to construct a genetically modified strain of a steroid-degrading micro-organism lacking the ability to degrade the steroid nucleus, the method comprising inactivation of multiple genes involved in steroid nucleus degradation, wherein the first gene is deleted by unmarked gene deletion.  
 
     
 2. Method according to claim 1, wherein the method comprises deletion of multiple steroid dehydrogenase genes.  
 
     
 3. Method according to claim 2, wherein a first deleted gene is kstD1 or kstD2.  
 
     
 4. Method according to claim 3, wherein any subsequent gene is inactivated by UV irradiation.  
 
     
 5. Method according to claims 3 or 4, wherein any subsequent gene is deleted by unmarked gene deletion.  
 
     
 6. Method according to claim 1, wherein the second gene is deleted by unmarked gene deletion.  
 
     
 7. Method according to claims 1-6 wherein the micro-organism is Rhodococcus, preferably R erythopolis.  
 
     
 8. Micro-organism prepared according to claims 1-7.  
 
     
 9. Micro-organism according to claim 8 wherein at least both kstD1 and kstD2 are inactivated.  
 
     
 10. Genetically modified strain Rhodococcus erythropolis RG1-UV29 (DSM 13157).  
 
     
 11. Use of micro-organisms according to claims 8-10 in the preparation of 9.alpha.-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione by growing said micro-organisms on a culture medium comprising 4-androstene-3,17-dione.  
 
     
 12. Nucleotide sequence encoding KSTD1 protein encoded by nucleotides 820-2329 of SEQ ID NO:1.  
 
     
 13. Nucleotide sequence encoding KSTD2 protein encoded by nucleotides 1-1678 of SEQ ID NO:5.
