 6. The vector of  claim 1 , wherein the heterologous nucleic acid molecule encodes at least 400 contiguous residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. 
 
     
 7. The vector of  claim 1 , wherein the heterologous nucleic acid molecule encodes at least 500 contiguous residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. 
 
     
 8. The vector of  claim 1 , wherein the heterologous nucleic acid molecule encodes at least 600 contiguous residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. 
 
     
 9. The vector of  claim 1 , wherein the heterologous nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. 
 
     
 10. The vector of  claim 1 , wherein the vector is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector. 
 
     
 11. A method of inducing an immune response in a subject, comprising:
 administering an effective amount of the vector of  claim 1  to the subject to induce the immune response. 
 
 
     
 12. The method of  claim 11 , wherein the immune response inhibits Ebola virus infection in the subject. 
 
     
 13. A vector, comprising a heterologous nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least 75% identical to SEQ ID NO: 9. 
 
     
 14. The vector of  claim 13 , wherein the polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least 80% identical to SEQ ID NO: 9.

 18. The vector of  claim 13 , wherein the vector is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector. 
 
     
 19. A method of inducing an immune response in a subject, comprising:
 administering an effective amount of the vector of  claim 13  to the subject to induce the immune response. 
 
 
     
 20. The method of  claim 19 , wherein the immune response inhibits Ebola virus infection in the subject.
