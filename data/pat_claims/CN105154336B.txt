In described Trichoderma viride (Trichoderma viride) XJ-3 CGMCC culture presevation number is NO.10989. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. Trichoderma viride (Trichoderma viride) XJ-3 as claimed in claim 1 is in cotton stalk decomposed manure is prepared
Using. 
 
     
 A kind of 3. method that cotton stalk decomposed manure is prepared using Trichoderma viride XJ-3, it is characterised in that described preparation method
Method acquisition is prepared by the following procedure： 
 (1) strain activation and culture：Prepare Trichoderma viride (Trichoderma viride) XJ-3CGMCC NO.10989 bacterial strains
Potato dextrose agar, sterile working is strictly carried out after sterilizing, flat board is forwarded to from inclined-plane, is cultivated at 28 DEG C of temperature
5 days； 
 (2) one-level culture：It is forwarded to and is equipped with from picking single bacterium colony on the potato dextrose agar solid medium in step (1)
In the 50mL conical flasks of potato dextrose broth, sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min cultures 24h-48h； 
 (3) two level expands culture：Above-mentioned steps one-level culture strain is inoculated in and fills potato dextrose broth
In 500mL conical flasks, sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min cultures 24h-48h； 
 (4) determination of water：Mark is assessed according to the ratio that rear every mu of cotton stalk yield of cotton is 250 kilograms to 450 kilograms is plucked
Standard, cotton stalk processing need to add the 60%-65% that water is cotton stalk yield； 
 (5) it is inoculated with：Trichoderma viride (Trichoderma viride) XJ-3CGMCC NO.10989 prepared by step (3) are activated
In water prepared by strain inoculation above-mentioned steps (4), water 10%-15% ratio inoculation as required prepares Trichoderma viride
Microbial inoculum, and strain protective agent, urea and diamines are added respectively according to the microbial inoculum amount of preparation, wherein, strain protective agent is by sucrose, paddy
Propylhomoserin sodium and glycerine are according to weight ratio 1:1:1 proportioning, strain protective agent is according to 15% addition, and urea and diamines are respectively according to 30%
Ratio with 20% is added, and fermentation base-material is prepared by stirring； 
 (6) cotton stalk crushing returning to the field：After having plucked cotton in autumn, by crop field operation by cotton stalk crushing, the length of cotton stalk after crushing
Control as 3cm-5cm, the fermentation base that step (5) preparation is sprayed on spray equipment cotton stalk after being pulverized is utilized in crushing process
Material； 
 (7) ferment：Fermentation base-material prepared by step (6) is raised together in company with the cotton stalk after crushing and is sprinkling upon in cotton field, is adopted
Buried, irrigate using winter irrigation water by cotton field flood is climing, autumn last year to Second Year with common equipment of the ploughing base-material that will ferment
Cotton stalk is prepared into cotton stalk decomposed manure by fermenting during spring. 
 
     
 
   
 
 4. the cotton stalk for preparing the method preparation of cotton stalk decomposed manure using Trichoderma viride XJ-3 as claimed in claim 3 is decomposed to be had
Machine fertilizer.
