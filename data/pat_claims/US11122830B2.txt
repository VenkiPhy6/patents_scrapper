 1. A method for producing an antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract comprising: fermenting a cranberry extract with a bacterial strain having all the identifying characteristics of the bacterium deposited under International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC) Accession Number 160103 thereby producing the antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract, wherein the antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract is enriched for phenolic antioxidants. 
 
     
 2. A method for producing an antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract comprising: fermenting a cranberry extract with a bacterial strain having a 16S rRNA gene comprising a nucleotide sequence that is at least 99.5% identical to the nucleotide sequence of a 16S rRNA gene of the bacterium deposited under International Depositary Authority of Canada (IDAC) Accession Number 160103, as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 thereby producing the antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract, wherein the antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract is enriched for phenolic antioxidants. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 2 , wherein the 16S rRNA gene comprises a nucleotide sequence that is identical to the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 1 , further comprising concentrating the antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 2 , further comprising concentrating the antioxidant-enriched cranberry extract. 
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the cranberry extract is cranberry juice. 
 
     
 7. The method of  claim 2 , wherein the cranberry extract is cranberry juice. 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the phenolic antioxidants include gallic acid. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 2 , wherein the phenolic antioxidants include gallic acid.
