 1. A recombinant Equine Herpes Virus type 4(EHV-4), wherein 900-1150 bp of the gM open reading frame are deleted, wherein said EHV-4 is free of heterologous elements. 
 
     
 2. A recombinant Equine Herpes Virus type 4 (EHV-4) wherein the entire gM coding sequence is deleted except for 0-50 bp of the coding sequence for the C-terminal portion and except for 150-250 bp of the coding sequence for the N-terminal portion, and wherein said EHV-4 s free of heterologous elements. 
 
     
 3. The EHV-4 according to  claim 2 , wherein the entire gM coding sequence is deleted except for 34 bp of the coding sequence for the C-terminal portion and except for 209 bp of the coding sequence for the N-terminal portion. 
 
     
 4. A recombinant Equine Herpes Virus type 4 (EHV-4) wherein nucleotides 92681-92731 to 93765-93865 of the gM coding sequence as corresponding to SEQ ID NO:2 are deleted, and wherein said EHV-4 is free of heterologous elements. 
 
     
 5. The EHV-4 according to  claim 4 , wherein nucleotides 92681 to 93865 of the gM coding sequence as corresponding to SEQ ID NO:2 are deleted. 
 
     
 6. The EHV-4 according to  claim 4 , wherein nucleotides 92715 to 93824 of the gM coding sequence as corresponding to SEQ ID NO:2 are deleted. 
 
     
 7. The EHV-4 according to  claim 1 , wherein said EHV-4 is based on MSV Lot 071398 and isolate E4Î”gM-w and that it is the EHV-4 which was deposited at the ECACC/CAMR on Jan. 14, 2003 with the accession number 03011401.
