 2. utilize bacterial strain described in claim 1 a to carry out preparation technology that solid state fermentation brewages apricot skin slag vinegar, it is characterized in that, it is as follows that described solid state fermentation brewages concrete steps: 
 (1) raw materials pretreatment: selection nothing is gone mouldy, yellow dry apricot skin slag, removes foreign material, and with clear water by the earth on apricot skin slag, foreign material cleaned standby seam; Rice Universalpulverizer is smashed, and crosses 40 mesh sieves, makes rice meal; 121 DEG C, rice husk, 15min sterilizing; 
 (2) prepare apricot skin scum juice: the warm water dry apricot skin slag cleaned being put into 50 DEG C, be apricot skin slag by weight ratio: warm water is 1: 5, soaks 4h, crosses leaching juice, adjustment soluble solid is 18%, 100 DEG C of water-bath sterilization 5min; 
 (3) apricot skin slag slurry is prepared: adopt steaming and decocting under high pressure and enzymolysis combined techniques, be crushing and beating after 1: 6 immersion 2h by weight by apricot skin slag and water, at 121 DEG C of high pressure 10min, add 200U polygalacturonase and 150U cellulase according to every gram of apricot skin slag after cool to room temperature, enzymolysis 4h at 50 DEG C; 
 (4) rice converted mash is prepared: getting weight is rice meal: warm water is be mixed with mash at 1: 3, mash is first used 12U/g mesophilicÎ±-diastase, liquefy 45min under 65 DEG C of conditions, then add 180U/g saccharifying enzyme, under 70 DEG C of conditions, process 180min; 
 (5) rice converted mash prepared by apricot skin slag slurry step (3) prepared and step (4) mixes acquisition mixed pulp with weight 1: 1, and the mixed pulp of acquisition is processed 5min under the sterilization conditions of 100 DEG C; 
 (6) preparation of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae seed liquor and ester-producing yeast seed liquor: be seeded to by common yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in 10ml18% apricot skin scum juice, cultivates 24h, obtains yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae seed liquor for 28 DEG C; Get common ester-producing yeast and be seeded to 28 DEG C of cultivation 36h in 10ml18% apricot skin scum juice, obtain ester-producing yeast seed liquor; 
 (7) solid alkaline component AAS cement: with 4.5% (v/v) inoculum size by yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae seed liquor and with 2.25% (v/v) inoculum size by the mixed pulp of preparation in ester-producing yeast seed liquor access step (5), the soluble solid content of mixed pulp is 17%, by mixed pulp: rice husk be 3: 1 weight add rice husk, sealed fermenting, 28 DEG C of fermentation 6d, obtain apricot skin slag alcohol fermentation liquid; 
 (8) solid-state acetic fermentation: the preserving number getting slant preservation is the bacillus aceticus mutant strain AcetobacterpomorumAcF1 of CCTCCNo:M2013554,1 ring is seeded in apricot skin slag alcohol fermentation liquid prepared by 10ml step (7), the initial alcoholic strength of apricot skin slag alcohol fermentation liquid is 6% (v/v), cultivate 24h, obtain the bacillus aceticus mutant strain AcetobacterpomorumAcF1 seed liquor that preserving number is CCTCCNo:M2013554 for 30 DEG C; In apricot skin slag alcohol fermentation liquid prepared by bacillus aceticus mutant strain AcetobacterpomorumAcF1 seed liquor access step (7) being CCTCCNo:M2013554 by preserving number by the inoculum size of 14% (v/v), 31 DEG C of static fermentation 25d; 
 (9) apricot skin slag vinegar clarification: add the bentonite that 6ml mass concentration is 4% according to every 100ml apricot skin slag vinegar, the centrifugal 5min of clarification 24h, 4500r/min, collects clear liquor, obtains apricot skin slag vinegar; 
 (10) finished product sterilization: apricot skin slag vinegar is kept 3min sterilization according to 75 DEG C. 
 
     
 3. the apricot skin slag vinegar utilizing the bacterial strain described in claim 1 and solid fermentation preparing technology according to claim 2 to brewage preparation.
