 1. An L-threonine or L-tryptophan producing recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain, wherein the strain is modified by deletion of at least one polynucleotide, wherein the polynucleotide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, and SEQ ID NO: 5. 
 
     
 2. The L-threonine or L-tryptophan producing recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain according to  claim 1 , wherein the polynucleotide encodes a protein selected from the group consisting of YsaA having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, a protein YdaS having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, and a protein YbiX having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. 
 
     
 3. The L-threonine or L-tryptophan producing recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain according to  claim 1 , wherein the recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain is L-threonine producing  Escherichia coli  CA03-4257P (KCCM11243P). 
 
     
 4. The L-threonine or L-tryptophan producing recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain according to  claim 1 , wherein the recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain is L-tryptophan producing  Escherichia coli  CA04-2002 (KCCM11245P). 
 
     
 5. A method for producing L-threonine or L-tryptophan, the method comprising culturing an L-threonine or L-tryptophan producing recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain, wherein the strain is modified by deletion of at least one polynucleotide, wherein the polynucleotide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, and SEQ ID NO: 5. 
 
     
 6. The method according to  claim 5 , wherein the recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain is L-threonine producing  Escherichia coli  CA03-4257P (KCCM11243P). 
 
     
 7. The method according to  claim 5 , wherein the recombinant  Escherichia coli  strain is L-tryptophan producing  Escherichia coli  CA04-2002 (KCCM11245P).
