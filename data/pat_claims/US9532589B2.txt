 1. A method of culturing a tea fungus for producing a tea fungus culture broth comprising:
 the fermentation of a broth containing carbohydrate-containing raw materials by placing a tea fungus culture into said broth for fermentation wherein said broth is treated by aeration under excess pressure and circulated by a circulation pump during a fermentation preventing thereby zooglea formation, and 
 the tea fungus culture is  Medusomyces gisevii  VKPM SA-12. 
 
 
     
 2. The method of culturing a tea fungus for producing a tea fungus culture broth according to  claim 1 , wherein preliminary fermentation is carried out using  Zygosaccharomyces bisporus  followed by end fermentation using the  Medusomyces gisevii  VKPM SA-12. 
 
     
 3. A method for making kombucha beverages from vegetable juices or vegetables comprising a fermentation of a nutrition media containing vegetable juices or deviled vegetables mixed with salt and spices wherein a fermentation is performed by a tea fungus culture broth of  Medusomyces gisevii  VKPM SA-12 obtained by the method of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 4. A product obtained by the method of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 5. The method of culturing a tea fungus for producing a tea fungus culture broth according to  claim 1  wherein the pressure is at least 0.4 to 0.7 atmosphere, and the circulation is performed 4 to 6 times per day for 1 to 2 minutes.
