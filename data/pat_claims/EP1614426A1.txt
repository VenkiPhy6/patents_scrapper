 • resistant to the infection with the hybrid-recombinant phage VGJΦ::CTXΦ (SEQ ID: No 1) and thus to the consequent conversion to virulence, 
 • unable of further spreading an incoming CTXΦ via the emergence of a VGJΦ::CTXΦ hybrid-recombinant (SEQ ID: No 1), and 
 • presented in freeze dried formulations comprising the following substances: lactose, peptone, yeast extract and sorbitol with a total concentration not higher than 10%.   
 
     
 The live attenuated strains of claim 1 wherein, the strain or strains are  characterized by  being:
 • resistant to infection with the hybrid recombinant phage VGJΦ::CTXΦ (SEQ ID: No 1) due to a mutation that impairs the correct assembly of the VGJΦ receptor, the MSHA fimbria, on the bacterial surface, 
 • unable of further spreading an incoming CTXΦ via the emergence of a VGJΦ::CTXΦ hybrid recombinant (SEQ ID: No 1) due to the lack of VGJΦ DNA sequences in their genomes, and 
 • presented in freeze dried formulations comprising lactose (range of concentration 4,0 to 6,0%), peptone (range of concentrations 0,5 to 2,0 %) and sorbitol (range of concentrations 0,5 to 2,0%) or comprising yeast extract (range of concentrations 0,5% to 2,0% and sorbitol (range of concentrations 1,0 to 2,0 %)   
 
     
 The live attenuated strains of claims 1 and 2, wherein the strain or strains are  characterized by  being:
 • resistant to infection with the hybrid-recombinant phage VGJΦ:CTXΦ (SEQ ID: No 1) due to a spontaneous and stable mutation that impairs the correct and functional assembly of the VGJΦ receptor, the MSHA fimbria, on the bacterial surface,   
 
     
 The live attenuated strains according to claims 1, 2 and 3 wherein the strain or strains are  characterized by  being one or more among the following strains of  Vibrio cholerae  of serogroup O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa (deposited with the BCCM, LMG international depository authority).
 • Vibrio cholerae JCG01 (LMG P-22149) 
 • Vibrio cholerae JCG02 (LMG P-22150)   
 
     
 The live attenuated strains of claims 1 and 2, wherein the strain or strains are  characterized by  being:
 • resistant to infection with the hybrid recombinant phage 0VGJΦ::CTXΦ (SEQ ID: No 1) due to a deletion introduced in the  mshA  gene that impairs the synthesis of the structural subunit of the phage receptor, the MSHA fimbria, and its subsequent expression on the bacterial surface,   
 
     
 The live attenuated strains according to claims 1, 2 and 5 wherein the strain or strains are  characterized by  being one or more among the following list of strains of  Vibrio cholerae  of serogroups 0139 and O1 of the biotype EI Tor, serotype Ogawa (deposited with the BCCM, LMG international depository authority).
 • Vibrio cholerae JCG03 (LMG P-22151) 
 • Vibrio cholerae KMD01 (LMG P-22153) 
 • Vibrio cholerae KMD02 (LMG P-22154) 
 • Vibrio cholerae KMD03 (LMG P-22155) 
 • Vibrio cholerae JCG04 (LMG P-22152) 
 • Vibrio cholerae ESP01 (LMG P-22156) 
 • Vibrio cholerae ESP02 (LMG P-22157) 
 • Vibrio cholerae ESP03 (LMG P-22158) 
 • Vibrio cholerae RAF01 (LMG P-22159) 
 • Vibrio cholerae TLP01 (LMG P-22160) 
 • Vibrio cholerae TLP02 (LMG P-22161) 
 • Vibrio cholerae TLP03 (LMG P-22162)   
 
     
 The live attenuated strains according to claims 1, 2 and 5 wherein the strain or strains belong to a new emergent serotype against which the existent cholera vaccines are not effective.
