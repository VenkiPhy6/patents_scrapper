 1. A process for inhibiting the production of a target gene product by a plant cell which comprises transforming said cell with a recombinant DNA adapted to express mRNA in the cell during the period in which mRNA is being produced by the target gene, in which the recombinant DNA codes for only part of the target gene product and in which the target gene product is a fruit-ripening enzyme selected from the group consisting of pectinesterase, galactosidase, glucanase, xylanase, cellulase and polygalacturonase.  
 
     
 2. A process as claimed in claim 1 in which said mRNA is expressed by a recombinant construct selected from the group consisting of pJR36S, pJR56S, pJR76S, pJR26S, pJR46S, pJR66S, pJR86S, pJR101S, pJR111S, pJR102S and pJR112S.  
 
     
 3. A process as claimed in claim 1 in which said mRNA is expressed by a recombinant construct having the structure of pJR16S.
