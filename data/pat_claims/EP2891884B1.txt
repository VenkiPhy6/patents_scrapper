 measuring, in a serum or blood sample, a level of IL-8; and 
 comparing the measured level with a reference, 
 wherein an increase in the measured level of IL-8 in a serum or blood sample obtained from the subject, relative to the reference which is a serum or blood sample where the c-Met inhibitor is not effective, indicates that the c-Met inhibitor would be effective or that the subject is suitable for the application of a c-Met inhibitor, and 
wherein the c-Met inhibitor is an anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, which recognizes or binds an epitope comprising 5 to 19 contiguous amino acid residues within SEQ ID NO: 71 and wherein the epitope comprises at least SEQ ID NO: 73. 
 
     
 The method of claim 1, wherein the anti-c-Met antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises:
 (i) heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) comprising (a) a CDR-H1 comprising SEQ ID NO: 4; (b) a CDR-H2 comprising SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 5, or an amino acid sequence comprising 8-19 consecutive amino acids within SEQ ID NO: 2 including the 3 rd  to 10 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 2; and (c) a CDR-H3 comprising an amino acid sequence comprising 6-13 consecutive amino acids within SEQ ID NO: 85 including the 1 st  to 6 th  positions of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 85, SEQ ID NO: 85, or SEQ ID NO: 6; and 
 (ii) light chain CDRs comprising (a) a CDR-L1 comprising SEQ ID NO: 7, (b) a CDR-L2 comprising SEQ ID NO: 8, and (c) a CDR-L3 comprising SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 86, or 9-17 consecutive amino acids within SEQ ID NO: 89 including the 1 st  to 9 th  positions of SEQ ID NO: 89.   
 
     
 A use of at least one interacting material selected from the group consisting of an IL-8 binding antibody and an IL-8 binding aptamer in the method of claim 1 or 2. 
 
     
 A c-Met inhibitor as defined in claim 1 or 2 for use in a method of treating a cancer in a subject, wherein the subject has been selected by the method of claim 1.
