 1. A transformed yeast for producing 1-octen-3-ol transformed with a recombinant vector comprising
 the nucleotide sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 9, 10 and 11 encoding lipoxygenase and the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 encoding hydroperoxide lyase. 
 
 
     
 2. A method for producing a transformed yeast for producing 1-octen-3-ol comprising the steps of:
 isolating total RNA of pine mushroom and synthesizing cDNA; 
 PCR-amplifying a lipoxygenase gene comprising the nucleotide sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 9-11 and a hydroperoxide lyase gene comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 from the synthesized cDNA; 
 gene-cloning each of the amplified lipoxygenase gene and hydroperoxide lyase gene in a vector; 
 gene-cloning each of the cloned lipoxygenase gene and hydroperoxide lyase gene in each yeast expression vector; and 
 transforming and incubating the yeast expression vector into a yeast to produce 1-octen-3-ol. 
 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 2 , wherein the yeast expression vector is a vector selected from a pYES3/CT vector and a pYES2/CT vector. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 3 , wherein the pYES3/CT vector and the pYES2/CT vector are used in a ratio of 1:1. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 2 , wherein the yeast is incubated in a SC medium using 0.01 to 100 mM of linoleic acid at 15° C. to 45° C. for 12 to 48 hours. 
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 2 , wherein the yeast is  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.    
 
     
 7. A method for producing 1-octen-3-ol comprising the steps of:
 biosynthesizing 1-octen-3-ol by incubating the transformed yeast for producing the 1-octen-3-ol of  claim 1  in a medium; and 
 obtaining the biosynthesized 1-octen-3-ol.
