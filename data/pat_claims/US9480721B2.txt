 1. A method for treating a tumour wherein said method comprises administering, to a subject in need of such treatment, an anti-tumour agent that comprises a bacteria strain, and/or a metabolite from said bacteria strain, wherein said bacteria strain is selected from the group consisting of  Lactobacillus plantarum  I-UL4(NRRL B67067), TL1(NRRL B67068), RS5 (NRRL B67069), RG14 (NRRL B67071), RG11 (NRRL B67070) and RI11 (NRRL B67072) deposited at the Agricultural Research Culture Collection (NRRL), an International Deposit Authority recognized under the Budapest Treaty. 
 
     
 2. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the bacteria strain is in a live form or a non-live, but intact, form. 
 
     
 3. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the bacteria strain produces a metabolite that inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of cancer in a mammal. 
 
     
 4. The method according to  claim 3 , wherein the mammal is a human. 
 
     
 5. The method according to  claim 3 , wherein the metabolite is a bacteriocin. 
 
     
 6. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the metabolite is supported with a nutrient, vitamin, salt of an organic acid, or a combination thereof. 
 
     
 7. The method according to  claim 6 , wherein the vitamin is vitamin B. 
 
     
 8. The method according to  claim 6 , wherein the salt of an organic acid is the sodium salt of formic acid, acetic acid or lactic acid. 
 
     
 9. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the bacteria strain is grown in a total complete growth medium and the metabolite is present at between 0% (v/v) and 50% (v/v) of the medium. 
 
     
 10. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the metabolite can reduce viability in human cancerous cells when present at a concentration of 1% (v/v) to 50% (v/v). 
 
     
 11. The method according to  claim 10 , wherein the human cancerous cells are human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29, human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human liver cancer cell line Hep G2, human leukemia cell lines HL-60 or K-562. 
 
     
 12. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the metabolite can inhibit the proliferation of human cancerous cells when present at a concentration of 1% (v/v) to 50% (v/v). 
 
     
 13. The method according to  claim 10 , wherein the human cancerous cells are human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 or human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29. 
 
     
 14. A method for inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, wherein the method comprises administering to the cancer cells a lactic acid bacteria strain, or a metabolite produced by said strain, wherein said strain is selected from the group consisting of  Lactobacillus plantarum  I-UL4 (NRRL B67067), TL1 (NRRL B67068), RS5 (NRRL B67069), RG14 (NRRL B67071), RG11(NRRL B67070) and RI11 (NRRL B67072) deposited at the NRRL, an International Deposit Authority recognized under the Budapest Treaty. 
 
     
 15. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the anti-tumour agent comprises a combination of metabolites derived from  Lactobacillus plantarum  I-UL4 (NRRL B67067), TL1(NRRL B67068), RS5 (NRRL B67069), RG14 (NRRL B67071), RG11 (NRRL B67070) and RI11 (NRRL, B67072). 
 
     
 16. A method to facilitate apoptosis of cancer cells in a mammal, wherein the method comprises administering to the mammal an effective quantity of at least one lactic acid bacteria strain, and/or a metabolite from said bacteria strain, and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, wherein said bacteria strain is selected from the group consisting of  Lactobacillus plantarum  I-UL4 (NRRL B67067), TL1 (NRRL B67068), RS5 (NRRL B67069), RG14 (NRRL 867071), RG11 (NRRL B67070) and RI11 (NRRL B67072) deposited at NRRL. 
 
     
 17. The method according to  claim 16 , wherein the mammal is a human. 
 
     
 18. (The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the said bacteria strain is  Lactobacillus plantarum  I-UL4 (NRRL B67067). 
 
     
 19. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the said bacteria strain is  Lactobacillus plantarum  TL1 (NRRL B67068). 
 
     
 20. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the said bacteria strain is  Lactobacillus plantarum  RS5 (NRRL B67069). 
 
     
 21. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the said bacteria strain is  Lactobacillus plantarum  RG14 (NRRL B67071).
