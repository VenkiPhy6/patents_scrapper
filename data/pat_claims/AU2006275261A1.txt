Claim 11. A method of treating a human tumor in a mammal, wherein said human tumor expresses an at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody encoded by a clone deposited with the IDAC as accession number 170505-01 or a CDMAB thereof, which CDMAB is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, comprising administering to said mammal said monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof in an amount effective to result in a reduction of said mammal's tumor burden. Claim 12. The method of claim 11 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. Claim 13. The method of claim 12 wherein said cytotoxic moiety is a radioactive isotope. 38 SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26) WO 2007/014460 PCT/CA2006/001251 Claim 14. The method of claim I I wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof activates complement. Claim 15. The method of claim 11 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Claim 16. The method of claim 11 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is humanized. Claim 17. The method of claim 11 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is chimerized. Claim 18. A method of treating a human tumor susceptible to antibody induced cellular cytotoxicity in a mammal, wherein said human tumor expresses at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody encoded by a clone deposited with the IDAC as accession number 170505-01 or a CDMAB thereof, which CDMAB is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, comprising administering to said mammal said monoclonal antibody or said CDMAB thereof in an amount effective to result in a reduction of said mammal's tumor burden. Claim 19. The method of claim 18 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. Claim 20. The method of claim 19 wherein said cytotoxic moiety is a radioactive isotope. Claim 21. The method of claim 18 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof activates complement. Claim 22. The method of claim 18 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Claim 23. The method of claim 18 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is humanized. 39 SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26) WO 2007/014460 PCT/CA2006/001251 Claim 24. The method of claim 18 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is chimerized. 40 SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)
