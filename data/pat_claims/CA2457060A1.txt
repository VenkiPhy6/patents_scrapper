 1. Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283), an Erwinia pathogen effective in controlling plant diseases and activating plant growth.  
 
     
 2. (cancelled)  
 
     
 3. A gene comprising a nucleotide sequences of No. 5.  
 
     
 4. A gene comprising a protein or polypeptided expressed by an amino acid sequences of No. 6.  
 
     
 5. A gene according to claim3, wherein said nucleotide sequences are derived from said Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283).  
 
     
 6. A recombinant expression vector comprising said gene according to claim3.  
 
     
 7. (cancelled)  
 
     
 8. Transformants comprising said gene according to claim3.  
 
     
 9. Tansformants according to 8, wherein said transformants are selected from the group consisting of bacteria and plants.  
 
     
 10. A protein or polypeptide in a non-infectious form which comprises said amino acid sequence of No. 6 and induces a hypersensitive response or resistance to pathogens in plants when in contact with plant cells.  
 
     
 11. The protein or polypeptide according to claim 10, wherein said amino acid sequences are derived from said Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283).  
 
     
 12. (cancelled)  
 
     
 13. The protein or polypeptide according to claim 10, wherein said protein or polypeptide is a recombinant.  
 
     
 14. A biopesticide composition comprising said protein or polypeptide according to claims 10 or 11 and a carrier.  
 
     
 15. A pesticide using said protein or polypeptide according to claims 10 or 11 and a carrier.  
 
     
 16. A plant growth activator using said protein or polypeptide according to claims 10 or 11 and a carrier.  
 
     
 17. A seed-treating agent using said protein or polypeptide according to claims 10 or 11 and a carrier.  
 
     
 18. An insect repellent using said protein or polypeptide according to claims 10 or 11 and a carrier.  
 
     
 19. A fertilizer using said protein or polypeptide according to claims 10 or 11 and a carrier.  
 
     
 20. A method for producing a protein or polypeptide that induces a hypersensitive response or resistance on a mass-scale by isolating and purifying said protein or polypeptide from cultures of Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283) and transformants containing a plant HR-inducing gene of the strain (KCCM 10282) from Erwinia pyrifoliae WT#3 (KCCM 10283).
