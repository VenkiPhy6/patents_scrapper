 1. An isolated, and optionally biologically pure, culture of bacteria deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-126755.  
 
 
 2. A bacterium of the bacteria deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-126755.  
 
 
 3. A bacterium derived from bacteria deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-126755 by a process comprising:  
 (a) exposing bacteria of the strain deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-126755 to ultraviolet light at an exposure greater than or equal to about 900 joules/m2; and 
 (b) isolating viable bacteria surviving growth under conditions in (a); wherein the isolated viable bacteria exhibit greater ultraviolet radiation absorption compared to the bacteria of (a) prior to exposure to ultraviolet light.  
 
 
 4. The bacterium of embodiment 3, wherein the greater ultraviolet radiation absorption is identified by comparison of ultraviolet radiation absorption of lyophilized bacteria of (a) prior to exposure to ultraviolet light that have been resuspended in water at a concentration of 0.25% w:v and lyophilized isolated viable bacteria of (c) resuspended in water at a concentration of 0.25% w:v.  
 
 
 5. A population of bacteria comprising one or more than one bacterium of any one of claims 2-4.  
 
 
 6. The population of bacteria of claim 5, wherein substantially all bacteria in the population are a bacterium of any one of claims 2-4.  
 
 
 7. The population of claim 6 wherein the population is isolated and optionally biologically pure.  
 
 
 8. A composition comprising a bacterium of the bacteria deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-126755, a bacterium of any one of claims A2-A4 and/or a population of bacteria of any one of claims 5-7.  
 
 
 9. A composition comprising cellular remains from bacteria deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-126755 or from a population of bacteria of any one of claims 5-7, wherein the cellular remains are non-vi able.  
 18 

 
 
 
 10. The composition of claim 9, wherein the cellular remains are lysed, secreted, lyophilized from, or otherwise derived from the bacteria.  
 
 
 11. The composition of any one of claims 8-10, wherein the composition is a sunscreen.  
 
 
 12. The composition of any one of claims 8-10, wherein the composition is paint.  
 
 
 13. The composition of any one of claims 8-10, wherein the composition is a layered composition comprising (i) a substrate upon which the strain of bacteria or its cellular remains are deposited on a surface of the substrate, and (ii) a surface layer of bacteria or cellular remains.  
 
 
 14. The culture, bacterium, population or composition of any one of claims 1-13, wherein the bacterium is a Bacillus cereus bacterium or the bacteria are Bacillus cereus bacteria.  
 
 
 15. A method of providing protection from ultraviolet light, comprising administering a composition according to any one of claims 8-11 to the skin of a subject.  
 
 
 16. A method of providing protection from ultraviolet light, comprising administering a composition according to any one of claims 8-10 and 12 to a surface on a substrate or comprising integrating or embedding a composition according to any one of claims 8-10 into a material. 
 
 
 17. A method of making a composition according to any one of claims 8-12, comprising: obtaining a bacterium of any one of claims 2-4, optionally rendering the bacterium non-viable, and adding the bacterium to a carrier to yield the composition.  
 
 
 18. A method of making a composition according to any one of claims 8-12, comprising: disrupting a bacterium of any one of claims 2-4 to yield bacterial remains, optionally isolating and/or optionally purifying the bacterial remains or subset thereof, and adding the bacterial remains or subset thereof to a carrier to yield the composition.  
 
 
 19. The method of claim 17 or 18, wherein the bacterium is a Bacillus cereus bacterium or the bacteria are Bacillus cereus bacteria.
