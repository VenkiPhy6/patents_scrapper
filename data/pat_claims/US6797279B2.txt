 1. A biologically pure culture of a photosynthetic bacterium  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  strain FERM BP-7434. 
 
     
 2. A healthy food, comprising: 
 biomass obtained by incubating the photosynthetic bacterium as set forth in  claim 1 , said biomass containing cells of said bacterium and a viscous material produced by said bacterium; wherein  
 said biomass has glucose contents ranging from 2.4 to 7.5 (weight %), ribose contents ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 (weight %), rhamnose contents ranging from 1.0 to 3.3 (weight %), and fucose contents ranging from 0.6 to 2.6 (weight %) after acid hydrolysis and before water washing; and  
 said biomass has glucose contents ranging from 0.8 to 3.3 (weight %), ribose contents ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 (weight %), rhamnose contents ranging from 0.4 to 2.0 (weight %), and fucose contents less than 0.6 (weight %) after acid hydrolysis and after water washing.  
 
     
 3. The healthy food as set forth in  claim 2 , wherein a lactic acid bacterium is incubated together with the photosynthetic bacterium. 
 
     
 4. The healthy food as set forth in  claim 2 , further comprising: 
 bacteriochlorophyll in a range between 0.2 and 3.0 (weight %).  
 
     
 5. The healthy food as set forth in  claim 2 , further comprising: 
 carotinoid materials in a range between 0.5 and 7.5 (Î¼mol/g).  
 
     
 6. The healthy food as set forth in  claim 2 , wherein 
 said biomass has glucose contents ranging from 3.5 to 6.5 (weight %), ribose contents ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 (weight %), rhamnose contents ranging from 1.2 to 3.0 (weight %), and fucose contents ranging from 0.8 to 2.4 (weight %) after acid hydrolysis and before water washing.  
 
     
 7. The healthy food as set forth in  claim 2 , wherein 
 said biomass has glucose contents ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 (weight %), ribose contents ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 (weight %), rhamnose contents ranging from 0.5 to 1.6 (weight %), and fucose contents of less than 0.5 (weight %) after acid hydrolysis and after water washing.  
 
     
 8. A mixed culture comprising photosynthetic bacteria  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  strain FERM BP-7434 as set forth in  claim 1  and lactic bacteria. 
 
     
 9. The culture as set forth in  claim 8 , wherein the lactic bacteria is a  Lactobacillus spp.  or a  Streptococcus spp.    
 
     
 10. A method of producing a healthy food comprising: 
 (a) incubating at least photosynthetic bacteria of  Rhodopseudomonas capsulatas  strain FER BP-7434 as set forth in  claim 1  under conditions to produce a biomass containing cells of said bacteria and a viscous material produced by said bacteria and  
 (b) processing the biomass to obtain said healthy food.
