A fertile, transgenic plant, the genome of which has been altered through the addition of a functional genetic element comprising a nucleic acid that encodes a CryET29 crystal protein or peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 2, wherein said nucleic acid confers upon said plant a phenotypic trait that is not found in the parentage of said plant. 
 
     
 2. A cell obtained from the transgenic plant of  claim 1 , wherein said cell comprises said functional genetic element. 
 
     
 3. Progeny of the plant of  claim 1 , wherein said progeny comprises said functional genetic element. 
 
     
 4. A seed from said progeny of  claim 3 , wherein said seed comprises said functional genetic element. 
 
     
 5. The transgenic plant of  claim 1 , wherein said functional genetic element comprises a promoter operatively linked to said nucleic acid. 
 
     
 6. A transgenic plant comprising a cryET29 transgene as contained in plasmid pEG1298 which is contained in  Escherichia coli  strain having accession number NRRL B-21624. 
 
     
 7. A transgenic plant comprising a transgene encoding a CryET29 crystal protein as produced in  Bacillus thuringiensis  strain having accession number NRRL B-21582.
