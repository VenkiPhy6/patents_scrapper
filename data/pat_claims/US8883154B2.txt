 1. An E58 antibody, encoded by deposit B-50843 ( E. coli  strain E-58 ScAb clone D6) deposited with the Agricultural Research Culture Collections, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds a protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, wherein said E58 antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof reduces or prevents the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 from interacting with IgE. 
 
     
 2. A therapeutic composition, comprising: the E58 antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof of  claim 1 , crude extract of pollen comprising an allergen comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 
     
 3. A composition, comprising:
 the E58 antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof of  claim 1 , crude extracts of Group I pollens and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 
 
     
 4. An E58 antibody, encoded by deposit B-50843 ( E. coli  strain E-58 ScAb clone D6) deposited with the Agricultural Research Culture Collections, that binds a pollen allergen having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, wherein said E58 antibody reduces or prevents the allergen from interacting with another antibody at more than one epitope. 
 
     
 5. A method of treating allergies in an individual, comprising the step of: administering a E58 antibody or antigen binding fragment of  claim 1  to the individual. 
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 5 , wherein the E58 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is administered topically in the nose of the individual or systemically into circulation of the individual.
