 1. A monoclonal antibody to human IL-12 which consists of a p35 subunit and a p40 subunit forming a p75 heterodimer, wherein said monoclonal antibody (a) immunologically reacts with an epitope presented by the p75 heterodimer of human IL-12, but is not immunologically reactive with any epitope presented by said p40 subunit alone; and (b) neutralizes at least 90% of the bioactivity of human IL-12 as measured by:    (i) inhibiting IL- 12 stimulated PHA-activated human lymphoblast proliferation wherein the concentration of said antibody is 0.5 µg/ml and the concentration of said human IL-12 is 0.25 ng/ml, or (ii) by inhibiting IL- 12 stimulated IFN-.gamma. production wherein the concentration of said antibody is 0.5 µg/ml and the concentration of said human IL-12 is 0.25 ng/ml.  
 
     
 2. The antibody of claim 1, wherein the antibody cross reacts with rhesus monkey IL-12.  
 
     
 3. The antibody of either of claims 1 to 2, wherein the antibody is produced from a cell line of the mouse.  
 
     
 4. The antibody of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the antibody is produced by a hybridoma having ATCC designation number HB-12446, HB-12447, HB-12448 or HB-12449.  
 
     
 5. The antibody of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the antibody is humanized.  
 
     
 6. A hybridoma that produces an antibody as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5.  
 
     
 7. A pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.  
 
     
 8. A method for producing a monoclonal antibody according to any one of claims 1-5 that selectively immunologically reacts with the human IL-12 p75 heterodimer which consists of a p35 subunit and a p40 subunit, comprising the steps of: (a) immunizing a mammal deficient in a gene encoding said p35 subunit or said. p40 subunit with the human IL-12 p75 heterodimer to produce antibodies; (b) obtaining antibodies from the immunized mammal; (c) screening said antibodies for their ability to selectively bind an epitope presented by the p75 heterodimer to obtain said selectively binding antibody.  
 
     
 9. A method for producing a monoclonal antibody according to any one of claims 1-5 that selectively immunologically reacts with the human IL-12 p75 heterodimer which consists of a p35 subunit and a p40 subunit, comprising the steps of: (a) immunizing a mammal deficient in a gene encoding said p35 subunit or said p40 subunit with the human IL-12 p75 heterodimer to produce antibodies; (b) harvesting antibody producing cells from the immunized mammal;  (c) forming a monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma from said cells and obtaining said monoclonal antibody; (d) screening said monoclonal antibody produced by said hybridoma for the ability to selectively bind to an epitope presented by the p75 heterodimer to obtain said selectively binding monoclonal antibody.  
 
     
 10. The method of claim 9, wherein the antibodies produced from the hybridoma are further screened and selected for their ability to cross read with rhesus monkey IL- 12.  
 
     
 11. The antibody as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 whenever produced by the method as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 10 or a process comprising the method as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 10.  
 
     
 12. The use of an antibody as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 to treat a disease associated with increased IL- 12 activity that results in aberrant Th1-type helper cell activity.  
 
     
 13. Use of any of an antibody according to any one of claims 1 to 5 for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of an autoimmune disorder.  
 
     
 14. The use according to claim 13, wherein said autoimmune disorder is selected from the group consisting of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
 
     
 15. The use according to claim 14, wherein said inflammatory bowel disease is Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.  
 
     
 16. Use of an antibody according to any one of claims 1 to 5 in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease or septic shock.
