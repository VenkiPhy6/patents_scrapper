A diagnostic method comprising.the steps of: contacting an amount of purified antibodies which specifically bind to phK2 with a sample of physiological fluid obtained from a human, wherein said fluid comprises phK2, for a sufficient time to allow the formation of binary complexes between at least a portion of said antibodies and a portion of said phK2, wherein said antibodies do not significantly react with hK3; and determining the amount of said complexes in said sample and correlating the amount of 15 said complexes to the presence or absence of oo ~prostate cancer in said human. 
 
     
 2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the 6* relative amount of said complexes is compared to a value representative of the amount of said complexes from a human not at risk of, or afflicted with, prostate cancer. Z 3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein steps and are' repeated at intervals to monitor the 25 progression of prostate cancer in said human. 
 
     
 4. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein step the antibodies specifically bind to phK2 and do not bind to hK3 or hK2. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein step the antibodies specifically bind to phK2 and to hK2 but not to hK3.
