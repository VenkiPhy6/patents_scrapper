 2. Method according to claim 1 characterized in that the poxvirus is selected from the group consisting of orthopoxviruses, avipoxviruses, suipoxviruses and capripoxviruses 
 
     
 3. Method according to anyone of claims 1 to 2 characterized in that the poxvirus is selected from the group consisting of vaccinia virus, goatpoxvirus, sheeppoxvirus, canarypoxvirus and fowlpoxvirus 
 
     
 4. Method according to claim 3 characterized in that the vaccinia virus is Elstree or modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA), in particular MVA-BN with the deposition number ECACC V00083008. Method according to anyone of claims 1 to 4 characterized in that the poxvirus is a recombinant poxvirus. 
 
     
 6. Method according to anyone of claims 1 to 5 characterized in that the high-pressure homogenization is carried out by putting the infected cells into a high pressure chamber, increasing the WO 03/054175 PCT/EP02/14179 pressure in the chamber and ejecting the infected cells through a nozzle. 
 
     
 7. Method according to claim 6 characterized in that the pressure in the chamber is increased to a value in the range of 200 to 1000 bar. 
 
     
 8. Method according to anyone of claims 6 to 7 characterized in that the nozzle has a diameter in the range of 0.10 to 0.6 mm. 
 
     
 9. Method according to anyone of claims 1 to 8 characterized in that the poxvirus containing homogenate is subjected to at least one purification step to obtain a poxvirus-enriched fraction. 
 
     
 10. Method according to claim 9 characterized in that one of the at least one purification steps is an ultrafiltration step. 
 
     
 11. Method according to claim 10 characterized in that the ultrafiltration is a cross-flow-filtration. 
 
     
 12. Method according to claim 11 characterized in that in the cross-flow-filtration step a membrane is used that has a pore size bigger than 500 kDa but equal or smaller than 0.1 pm. 
 
     
 13. Method according to anyone of claims 10 to 12 characterized in that subsequent to the ultrafiltration at least one column chromatography step is carried out. 
 
     
 14. Method according to anyone of claims 1 to 13 characterized in the poxvirus-containing homogenate or the poxvirus-enriched fraction is freeze-dried. Poxvirus-enriched fraction or poxvirus-containing homogenate obtained by the method according to anyone of claims 1 to 14. 
 
     
 16. Poxvirus-enriched fraction or poxvirus-containing homogenate according to claim 15 as vaccine. 
 
     
 17. Use of the poxvirus-enriched fraction or poxvirus- containing homogenate according to claim 15 for the preparation of a vaccine.
