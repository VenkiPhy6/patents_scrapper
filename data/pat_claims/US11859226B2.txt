 1. A method for producing a psicose from a fructose-containing substrate using a bacterium belonging to the genus  Microbacterium  having a psicose conversion activity, comprising
 reacting the fructose-containing substrate with at least one selected from the group consisting of a microbial cell of the bacterium, a culture of the bacterium, and a lysate of the bacterium in the presence of at least one metal ion selected from the group consisting of manganese ion and cobalt ion, 
 wherein the bacterium belonging to the genus  Microbacterium  is  Microbacterium phyllosphaerae,    
 wherein the  Microbacterium phyllosphaerae  is a strain deposited as an accession number KCCM12034P. 
 
 
     
 2. The method for producing a psicose of  claim 1 , wherein the step of reacting is performed by contacting the fructose-containing substrate with a support immobilized with at least one selected from the group consisting of a microbial cell of the bacterium, a culture of the bacterium, and a lysate of the bacterium. 
 
     
 3. The method for producing a psicose of  claim 1 , wherein the fructose-containing substrate contains fructose at a concentration of 40 to 75% (w/w). 
 
     
 4. The method for producing a psicose of  claim 1 , wherein the method is characterized by not using a buffer solution. 
 
     
 5. The method for producing a psicose of  claim 1 , wherein the method is performed under the temperature condition of 40 to 80Â° C. 
 
     
 6. The method for producing a psicose of  claim 1 , wherein the method is performed for 1 to 48 hours.
