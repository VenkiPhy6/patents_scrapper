 [ 1 ] Yeast GP-01 (a mutated Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, KCTC 11399BP) having an ability to produce the organic bio-germanium. 
 
 
 [2] A method for producing the yeast GP-Ol with ethanol-resistant, comprising a step for protoplast fusing Saccharomyces Cerevisiae(KCTC 7904) and Candida Ethanolica(KCTC l ISl). 
 
 
 [3] The method according to claim 2, further comprising a step for adding the obtained protoplast with the pelletized Saccharomyces Cerevisiae(KCTC 7904) and Candida Ethanolica(KCTC 7181), IM of sorbitol and 0.5M of 2-mercaptoethanol. 
 
 
 [4] The method according to claim 2, wherein the protoplast fusion is performed by fusing the protoplast with IM of sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (MW 4000). 
 
 
 [5] A method for a yeast Ge-32K containing the high content of organic bio- germanium, comprising a step of adding the yeast GP-Ol to the solution of sodium metagermanate(Na 2 Ge0 3 ) right before the use. 
 
 
 [6] The method according to claim 5, wherein the sodium metagermanate (Na 2 GeO 3 ) is prepared by dissolving a selected one among sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ), cardium carbonate(CaCO 3 ) and potassium bicarbonate(KHCO 3 ) in water and adding germanium dioxide(GeO 2 ) to the solution prepared as above at the equivalent volume ratio. 
 
 
 [7] The method according to claim 5, wherein a mixing ratio between the yeast GP- 
 01 (KCTC 11399BP) and the solution of sodium metagermanate (Na 2 GeO 3 ) is 1:0.5-2.0 (at volume). 
 
 
 [8] The method according to claim 6, further comprising a step for cultivating a broth containing the yeast GP-Ol(KCTC 13399BP) and sodium metagermanate(Na 2 Ge0 3 ) for 19-21 hours at pH 9-10 and temperature 30~40Â°C. 
 
 
 [9] A yeast containing the high content of organic bio-germanium(the yeast Ge-32K) as produced according to any one of claims 5 to 8.
