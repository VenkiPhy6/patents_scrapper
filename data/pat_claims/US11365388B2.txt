 1. An engineered microorganism comprising the deposited microorganism with Accession No. KCTC13699BP. 
 
     
 2. The engineered microorganism of  claim 1 , wherein the genome size is no more than 3.6 Mbp. 
 
     
 3. A method of producing pyruvate or a protein, the method comprising the step of culturing the microorganism of  claim 2 . 
 
     
 4. The engineered microorganism of  claim 1 , wherein the novel microorganism has a higher growth rate than  E. coli  MS56 strain. 
 
     
 5. A method of producing pyruvate or a protein, the method comprising the step of culturing the microorganism of  claim 4 . 
 
     
 6. The engineered microorganism of  claim 1 , wherein the microorganism has a higher pyruvate production capacity than  E. coli  MG1655 strain. 
 
     
 7. A method of producing pyruvate or a protein, the method comprising the step of culturing the microorganism of  claim 6 . 
 
     
 8. A method of producing pyruvate or a protein, the method comprising the step of culturing the microorganism of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 9. The engineered microorganism of  claim 1 , wherein the microorganism has a smaller genome size than  E. coli  MG1655 strain. 
 
     
 10. The engineered microorganism of  claim 1 , wherein the microorganism has a smaller genome size than  E. coli  MS56 strain.
