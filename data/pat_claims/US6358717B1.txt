 1. A method of producing butanol, acetone and ethanol comprising the steps of anaerobically culturing a biologically pure culture of  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA101 ATCC No. PTA-1550 in a nutrient medium with assimilable carbohydrates and recovering the butanol, acetone and ethanol. 
 
     
 2. The method of  claim 1  further comprising the step of fermenting the  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA 101 in a nutrient medium with assimilable carbohydrates for a period of from about 30 to about 275 hours prior to recovering the butanol. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 2  wherein the  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA 101 is fermented in the nutrient medium with the assimilable carbohydrates at a temperature of from about 30° C. to about 40° C. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 1  wherein the amount of butanol recovered is from about 18.0 g/L to about 21.0 g/L. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 1  wherein the recovered butanol demonstrates a yield of from about 32 to about 35%. 
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 1  wherein the assimilable carbohydrates are glucose, maltodextrin or corn steep liquor. 
 
     
 7. The method of  claim 1  wherein the nutrient medium contains an organic acid. 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 7  wherein the organic acid is acetate or butyrate. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 1  wherein the assimilable carbohydrates comprise starch. 
 
     
 10. A method of producing butanol, acetone and ethanol comprising the steps of culturing a biologically pure culture of  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA101 in a nutrient medium with assimilable carbohydrates, fermenting the  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA101 ATCC No. PTA-1550 in the nutrient medium with the assimilable carbohydrates for sufficient period of time to allow for the production of butanol, acetone and ethanol and recovering the butanol, acetone and ethanol. 
 
     
 11. The method of  claim 10  wherein the fermenting is batch fermentation. 
 
     
 12. The method of  claim 10  wherein the fermenting is continuous fermentation. 
 
     
 13. The method of  claim 10  wherein the amount of butanol recovered is from about 18.0 g/L to about 21.0 g/L. 
 
     
 14. The method of  claim 10  wherein the nutrient medium contains an organic acid. 
 
     
 15. The method of  claim 10  wherein the organic acid is acetate or butyrate. 
 
     
 16. A biologically pure culture of  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA101 ATCC No. PTA 1550. 
 
     
 17. A method for producing butanol comprising the steps of anaerobically culturing a biologically pure culture of  Clostridium beijerinckii  BA101 ATCC No. PTA 1550 in a nutrient medium with assimilable carbohydrates and recovering the butanol. 
 
     
 18. The method of  claim 17  wherein the assimilable carbohydrates comprise starch. 
 
     
 19. The method of  claim 17  wherein the nutrient medium contains an organic acid. 
 
     
 20. The method of  claim 19 , wherein the organic acid is acetate or butyrate.
