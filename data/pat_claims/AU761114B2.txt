 11. The method according to any one of claims 6 to 10 where the dose is between about x10 5 and lx106 bacteria per kg of body weight. 
 
     
 12. A method of decreasing the virulence associated with infection by wild type Porphyromonas gingivalis in a plurality of mammals, the method comprising: administering to a plurality of mammals at least one dose of the type Porphyromonas gingivalis stain which is deposited at ATCC under accession number 202109; and allowing the plurality of mammals to become exposed to wild type Porphyromonas gingivalis after administering to the mammal at least one dose of the type Porphyromonas gingivalis strain which is deposited at ATCC under accession number 202109; where the plurality of mammals exposed to the wild type Porphyromonas gingivalis demonstrate decreased morbidity and mortality associated with exposure to the wild type Porphyromonas gingivalis as compared to a comparable plurality of mammals that were exposed to wild type Porphyromonas gingivalis without previously being administered at least one dose of the type Porphyromonas gingivalis strain which is desposited at ATCC under accession number 202109. 
 
     
 13. A method according to claim 12, where administering comprises injecting S" 20 the at least one does of the Porphyromonas gingivalis strain which is desposited at ATCC under accession number 202109, via a route selected from the group consisting of a subcutaneous route, an intravascular route and an intramuscular route. 
 
     
 14. A method according to 12 or 13 where administering comprises injecting the at least one dose of the Porphyromonas gingivalis strain which is deposited at ATCC under accession number 202109, wherein the does is between about a 1x10 3 and 1x10 7 bacteria per kg of body weight. 
 
     
 A method according to any one of claims 12 to 14, where administering comprises injecting the at least one dose of the Porphyromonas gingivalis strain which is deposited at ATCC under accession number 202109, wherein the dose is between about 30 lxl05 and 1xl06 bacteria per kg of body weight. 
 
     
 16. Use of a recA, defective mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the preparation of a medicament for decreasing the morbidity and mortality rate associated with infection by Porphyromonas gingivalis. 004262656 21 
 
     
 17. A method according to claim 1 substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the examples. Freehills Carter Smith Beadle Patent Attorneys for the Applicant LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY
