An isolated bacterium wherein said isolated bacterium is  Salmonella typhimurium , wherein the isolated bacterium does not express a functional NiFe hydrogenase protein, wherein the isolated bacterium comprises a deletion mutation to each of three NiFe hydrogenase genes present in the genome of the isolated bacterium, wherein each mutation prevents the expression of the corresponding gene product, wherein the first deletion is flanked by nucleotides 1-136 and nucleotides 137-232 of SEQ ID NO: 7, wherein the second deletion is flanked by nucleotides 1-289 and nucleotides 290-518 of SEQ ID NO: 8, and wherein the third deletion is flanked by nucleotides 1-200 and nucleotides 201-333 of SEQ ID NO: 9. 
 
     
 2. A composition comprising an isolated bacterium, wherein the isolated bacterium comprises a mutation to each of three NiFe hydrogenase genes present in the genome of the isolated bacterium, wherein each mutation prevents expression of the corresponding gene product, and wherein the isolated bacterium is  S. typhimurium  strain JSG 321, deposited with the American Type Culture Collection depository. 
 
     
 3.  S. typhimurium  strain JSG 321 deposited with the American Type Culture Collection depository under Accession No: PTA-6556.
