 1. A method for preparing an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cell, which comprises the steps of:
 (a) providing a first cell population obtained from F1 hybrid B6D2F1 mouse ovarian tissue, wherein the first cell population comprises adult stem cells; 
 (b) providing a second cell population which is embryonic fibroblast layer originated from an outbred ICR mouse fetus, wherein the second cell population is treated with mitomycin; 
 (c) culturing the first cell population on the second cell population in a medium for a period of time sufficient to form a colony from the first cell population, wherein the culturing is carried out in the presence of at least 5,000 units/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor; and 
 (d) subculturing a cell from the colony in a medium for a period of time sufficient to prepare the ESC-like cell, wherein the subculturing is carried out in the presence of 800-1,200 units/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor to obtain said ESC-like cells. 
 
 
     
 2. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the first cell population is a heterogeneous population comprising at least two kinds of cells. 
 
     
 3. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the second cell population has adherent characteristics to culture plates. 
 
     
 4. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the ESC-like cell has a diploid karyotype.
