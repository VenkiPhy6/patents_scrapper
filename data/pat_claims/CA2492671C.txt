 1. A process for preparing a humanized antibody comprising the steps of:  (a) selecting a specificity determining residue (SDR) of the complementarity determining region (CDR) of murine monoclonal antibody heavy chain and light chain variable regions, wherein the step (a) is conducted by replacing each of the amino acid residues of CDR with alanine to produce mutants, selecting a mutant that has lower affinity (K D) to a human antigen than the original murine antibody and determining the replaced amino acid residue of said mutant as a SDR; and (b) grafting all of the said SDR to the corresponding amino acids of human antibody variable regions.  
 
     
 2. A humanized antibody produced by CHO/HuKR127 (Accession No.:  KCTC10199BP).  
 
     
 3. A DNA encoding a humanized antibody heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.  
 
     
 4. The DNA of Claim 3, wherein the variable region comprises the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.  
 
     
 5. A DNA encoding a humanized antibody light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4.  
 
     
 6. The DNA of Claim 5, wherein the variable region comprises the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:3.  
 
     
 7. An expression vector pHuKR127HC comprising the DNA of Claim 4.  
 
     
 8. An expression vector pHuKR127KC comprising the DNA of Claim 6.  
 
     
 9. An expression vector pdCMV-dhfrC-HuKR127 comprising both the DNAs of Claim 4 and Claim 6.  
 
     
 10. An E. coli DH5a/pdCMV dhfrC-HuKR127 (Accession No.: KCTC  10198BP) transformed with the expression vector of Claim 9.  
 
     
 11. CHO cell line CHO/HuKR127 (Accession No.: KCTC 10199BP) producing the humanized antibody of Claim 2.  
 
     
 12. A composition for preventing or treating HBV infection comprising the humanized antibody of Claim 2 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.  
 
     
 13. A use of the humanized antibody of claim 2 for preventing or treating HBV infection.
