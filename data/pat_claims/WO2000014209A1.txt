 2. A cDNA(SEQ ID NO: 18) encoding the human prothrombin kringle-1 of claim 1. 
 
 
 3. An amino acid sequence of human prothrombin kringle-2 represented as SEQ ID NO: 2. 
 
 
 4. A cDNA(SEQ ID NO: 19) encoding the human prothrombin kringle-2 of claim 3. 
 
 
 5. A recombinant expression vector pEF-hKl comprising a cDNA(SEQ ID NO: 18) which expresses human prothrombin kringle-1. 
 
 
 6. A recombinant expression vector pEF-hK2 comprising a cDNA(SEQ ID NO: 19) which expresses human prothrombin kringle-2. 
 
 
 7. E. coli BL21 (DE3) ZpLysS, phEF13 (KCCM-10139) which is transformed with the recombinant expression vector pEF-hK2 of claim 6. 
 
 
 8. A peptide which inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, which is derived from human prothrombin kringle-2 of human prothrombin. 
 
 
 9. The peptide of claim 8, which has a sequence of 5 to 20 amino acids in order from 11th proline to 70th aspartic acid of human prothrombin kringle-2 . 
 
 
 10. A process for preparing prothrombin kringle-1 and 2 from human plasma which comprises the steps of: 
 (i) isolating and purifying human prothrombin from  human plasma; 
 (╧ï) treating the human prothrombin with factor Xa to give prothrombin kringle-1 and 2; and, 
 (iii) isolating the prothrombin kringle-1 and 2 by employing ion-exchange chromatography. 
 
 
 11. A process for preparing a recombinant human prothrombin kringle-2 which comprises the steps of: 
 (i) culturing recombinant microorganism transformed with an expression vector comprising the cDNA of claim 4; and, 
 (ii) applying the culture to ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography to obtain the recombinant human prothrombin kringle-2. 
 
 
 12. The process for preparing a recombinant human prothrombin kringle-2 of claim 11, wherein the recombinant microorganism is E . coli BL21(DE3)/ pLysS,phEF13 (KCCM-10139) . 
 
 
 13. An anti-tumor agent comprising an active ingredient of the human prothrombin kringle-1 or 2, or its functionally equivalent peptide and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 
 
 14. The anti-tumor agent of claim 13 which is effective for skin cancer, laryngeal cancer, uterine cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and bone marrow cancer.
