 1. A method of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in a food, food material or food product, comprising adding an effective amount of a cell-free extract prepared from  Bacillus subtilis  to said food, food material or food product, wherein the  Bacillus subtilis  is the Maseca-1 strain, deposited under ATCC accession number PTA-8831, and wherein the effective amount of the extract is in a range of from 0.1 g to 1 g of extract per 100 g of food, food material or food product. 
 
     
 2. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the extract comprises a filtrate of <10 kDa. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the food, food material or food product is flour, dough or a cooked dough product. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the food, food material or food product is corn flour, corn dough or tortilla.
