 (a) providing an  E. coli  host cell which comprises a cyclic carotenoid having at least one β-ionone ring selected from the group consisting of β-carotene and γ-carotene; 
 (b) transforming the  E. coli  host cell of (a) with a nucleic acid molecule that is a crtU gene selected from group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 53 and encoding a carotene desaturase; said nucleic acid molecule being codon optimized for expression in the  E. coli  host cell; and 
 (c) growing the transformed  E. coli  host cell of (b) under conditions whereby an aryl carotenoid, selected from the group consisting of isorenieratene, chlorobactene and β-isorenieratene is produced. 
 
 
     
 2. A method according to  claim 1  wherein the cyclic carotenoid having a β-ionone ring is produced endogenously by the host cell. 
 
     
 3. A method according to  claim 1  wherein the cyclic carotenoid having a β-ionone ring is provided exogenously to the host cell. 
 
     
 4. An  E. coli  codon optimized carotene desaturase gene selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:18 and SEQ ID NO:53.
