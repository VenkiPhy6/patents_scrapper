           nocardiopsis sp.) EGI 80425, is characterized in that, described nocardia (
           nocardiopsis sp.) EGI 80425 preserving number is: CGMCC No. 9969.
         
 
     
 
   
 
 2. a nocardia as claimed in claim 1 (
           nocardiopsis sp.) EGI 80425 is producing the application in ansamitocin P-3 and derivative 15-hydroxyl ansamitocin P-3 thereof.
         
 
     
 
   
 
 3. a nocardia as claimed in claim 1 (
           nocardiopsis sp.) method of EGI 80425 fermentative production ansamitocin P-3 and 15-hydroxy derivatives thereof, is characterized in that, described method concrete steps are as follows:
         
 (1) prepare fermented bacterium: be inoculated in seed culture medium by bacterial strain EGI 80425, cultivate 24-48 hour in 28 DEG C; Described seed culture medium is by mass/volume percentage calculation: yeast extract 0.4%, glucose 0.4%, malt extract (cream) 1.0%, trace salt (1000 Ã—) 1.0 mL, pH 7.2-7.4; 
 (2) seed fermentation obtained above is utilized to produce ansamitocin P-3 and 15-hydroxy derivatives thereof: by the ratio access fermention medium of the 1:20-1:9 by volume of the seed after cultivating, cultivate 120-240 hour in 28 DEG C, obtain the fermenting culture containing ansamitocin P-3 and 15-hydroxy derivatives thereof; Described fermentation medium components and the same seed culture medium of preparation method; 
 (3) extraction and isolation ansamitocin P-3 and 15-hydroxy derivatives thereof from tunning: fermented liquid is centrifugal, and gained supernatant liquor ethyl acetate extracts 3 times repeatedly, and mycelium acetone extracts 3 times repeatedly, obtains crude extract after extraction liquid concentrating under reduced pressure; Adopt normal phase column chromatography, supernatant liquor crude extract chloroform/methanol system gradient elution, obtains 8 component 25-A1 ~ A8 altogether, and mycelium crude extract according to 10:0-5:5 gradient elution, obtains 5 component 25-B1 ~ B5 by chloroform/methanol system altogether; HPLC analysis obtains primary product two, be present in component 25-A2 and 25-B2, after TLC checking, again 25-A2 is carried out normal phase column chromatography, chloroform/methanol gradient elution, obtain 15 component 25A2-1 ~ A2-15 altogether, analyze through HPLC and merge into 25A2-6,25A2-7,25B2 in conjunction with after TLC checking, again with half preparative HPLC through acetonitrile/water 55%-75% linear elution 20min, flow velocity 2.5ml/min is separated, and obtains compd A nsamitocin P-3; Merge 25A2-8,25A2-9, carry out acetonitrile/water 30%-100% linear elution 18min with half preparative HPLC, flow velocity 2.5ml/min is separated, and obtains compound 15-Hydroxyansamitocin P-3.
