   14 . A method for generating a recombinant parainfluenzavirus, wherein the recombinant parainfluenzavirus comprises a G protein of a mammalian  metapneumovirus  or a fragment thereof, wherein the method comprises:
 (a) introducing into a host cell:
 (i) a cDNA encoding, under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, the parainfluenzavirus comprising a G protein of a mammalian  metapneumovirus;    
 (ii) cDNAs encoding, under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, the N, P, and L proteins of the parainfluenzavirus to be generated; 
 (iii) a nucleic acid encoding T7 RNA polymerase; 
   (b) obtaining the recombinant parainfluenzavirus.   
 
     
   15 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein the host cell is HEp-2 or Vero. 
 
     
   16 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein the nucleic acid encoding T7 RNA polymerase is introduced into the host cell via infection with Fowlpox-T7 virus. 
 
     
   17 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein one or more of the cDNAs comprise an IRES element. 
 
     
   18 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein the recombinant parainfluenza virus is a chimeric bovine/human parainfluenzavirus type 3. 
 
     
   19 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein step (b) comprises a freeze-thaw cycle at −80° C. 
 
     
   20 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein the G protein is a G protein of mammalian  metapneumovirus  variant A1, A2, B1, or B2. 
 
     
   21 . The method of  claim 14 , wherein the fragment of the G protein is at least 25 amino acids, 50 amino acids, 75 amino acids, or 100 amino acids long.
