The CGMCC deposit number of short mould (Aureobasidium pullulans) MF1 of stalk is No.CGMCC11275. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. radiation hardness Aureobasidium pullulans (Aureobasidium pullulans) MF1 as described in claim 1 is preparing melanin
Application, which is characterized in that the preparation method of the application be prepared by the following procedure method acquisition: 
 (1) activation of strain: by Aureobasidium pullulans (Aureobasidium pullulans) MF1 CGMCC
No.CGMCC11275 is inoculated in the improvement Cha Shi solid medium of improvement, and 28 DEG C of culture 48h carry out the activation of strain； 
 (2) culture of strain: by the strain inoculated of step (1) activation in improvement Cha Shi fluid nutrient medium, wherein improvement Cha Shi liquid
The amount of adding of body culture medium is 100mL, and glucose additive amount is 10.3g/L, and yeast extract additive amount is 2.02g/L, ammonium sulfate
Additive amount is 2.0g/L, and NaCl additive amount is 0.5g/L, and strain inoculum concentration is 2mL, and 30 DEG C, 180r/min shaking table culture 96h is obtained
Obtain liquid culture；The improvement Cha Shi fluid nutrient medium: sodium nitrate 3g, yeast extract 0.5g, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 1g, sulfuric acid
Magnesium (MgSO47H2O) 0.5g, potassium chloride 0.5g, ferrous sulfate 0.01g, glucose 30g, distilled water 1000mL, PH are naturally, divide
Dress, sterilizing； 
 (3) preparation of melanin first extract: the liquid culture of step (2) preparation is carried out at 10000r/min centrifugation 5min
Reason removes thallus, and obtaining supernatant is melanin first extract； 
 (4) preparation of melanin crude extract: the use of melanin first extract and melanin first extract equivalent prepared by step (3)
Dehydrated alcohol precipitating, it is dry to constant weight in 100 DEG C and with primary with 50% ethanol washing of melanin first extract equivalent, i.e.,
It can get melanin.
