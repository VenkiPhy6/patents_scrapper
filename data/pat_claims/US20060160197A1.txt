 (a) providing a first phase, wherein said first phase is a water-immiscible organic solvent mixture comprising: 
 (i) about 30 volume percent to about 99 volume percent of said first phase is at least one tertiary alkyl amine having the formula  
                     
 wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3  are independently a C8 to C12 alkyl group; and  
 (ii) about 1 volume percent to about 70 volume percent of said first phase is at least one diluent selected from the group consisting of methyl isobutyl ketone, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, methylene chloride, 1-chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, chloroform, kerosene, toluene, mixed xylenes, tributyl phosphate, and mixtures thereof;  
   (b) providing a second phase, wherein said second phase is an aqueous solution comprising glycolic acid having a pH of about 3 or less; said second phase formed by the process of: 
 (i) providing an aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate; said aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate having a concentration about 5 weight % to about 40 weight % ammonium glycolate; and  
 (ii) adding an amount of mineral acid sufficient to lower the pH of the aqueous ammonium glycolate solution of (b)(i) to about 3 or less;  
 whereby an aqueous solution comprising glycolic acid is formed;  
   (c) contacting said first phase with said second phase in a reactive extraction process; thereby forming a glycolic acid-loaded first phase;    (d) isolating said glycolic acid-loaded first phase;    (e) contacting said glycolic acid-loaded first phase with a third phase in a back-extraction process; whereby the glycolic acid in the glycolic acid-loaded first phase is extracted into said third phase; wherein said third phase is an aqueous solution that is immiscible in said glycolic acid-loaded first phase; and    (f) isolating the glycolic acid from said third phase.    
 
     
   2 . The process of  claim 1  wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3  are independently a C8 to C10 alkyl groups.

   9 . The process of  claim 1  wherein sulfuric acid is added to the aqueous solution of ammonium glycolate until the pH is about 2 to about 3.  
 
     
   10 . The process of  claim 1  wherein the reactive extraction process of step (1)(c) is performed at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 75° C.  
 
     
   11 . The process of  claim 10  wherein the back extraction process of step (1)(e) is performed at a temperature of about 120° C. to about 140° C.
