 1. An isolated DNA fragment coding for a non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigen polyopeptide, said DNA fragment having a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of nucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOS. 1 and 14. 
 
     
 2. An expression vector containing the DNA fragment according to claim 1 in a cloning site downstream from a promoter in the vector. 
 
     
 3. A host cell transformed with an expression plasmid containing the DNA fragment according to claim 1 in a cloning site downstream from a promoter in the plasmid, wherein the host cell is a microorganism selected from the group consisting of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and yeasts. 
 
     
 4. A process for producing a recombinant non-A non-B hepatitis-specific antigen polypeptide, which comprises the steps of: constructing a replicable expression vector having inserted therein a DNA fragment according to claim 1;   obtaining a transformant by introducing said expression vector into a host cell;   producing said recombinant polypeptide by culturing said transformant under such conditions that said DNA fragment is expressed; and   recovering the recombinant polypeptide.   
 
     
 5. The expression vector according to claim 2 which is a plasmid. 
 
     
 6. The expression vector according to claim 5 wherein the plasmid is selected from the group consisting of plasmid Trp.TrpE.C11-C21 and plasmid Trp.TrpE.C11-7. 
 
     
 7. The host cell according to claim 3 which is Escherichia coli. 
 
     
 8. A single strand DNA sequence that is a PCR primer for amplification of non-A and non-B hepatitis virus genes, said single strand DNA sequence having a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of nucleotide sequences shown in SEQ. ID NOS: 19, 20, 21 and 22.
