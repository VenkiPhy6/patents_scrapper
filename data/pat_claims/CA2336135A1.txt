 2. Mumbaistatin, a compound of the molecular formula C28H20O12, obtainable by cultivation of the microorganism Streptomyces species HIL-008003 (DSM 11641) under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing sources of carbon and nitrogen, followed by isolation and purification in a customary manner, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, in all their stereoisomeric and tautomeric forms.  
 
     
 3. The lactone L970880, a compound of the molecular formula C28H17O11, characterized by its 1 H NMR spectrum (Figure 7) and its 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 8), and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives, in all their stereoisomeric and tautomeric forms.  
 
     
 4. A process for the production of Mumbaistatin as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, or the lactone L970860 as claimed in claim 3, or a salt or derivative of Mumbaistatin or the lactone, comprising cultivation of the microorganism Streptomyces species HIL-008003 (DSM 11641) under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing sources of carbon and nitrogen, followed by isolation and purification of Mumbaistatin in a customary manner and, optionally, converting into the lactone L970860, or a salt or derivative of Mumbaistatin or the lactone.  
 
     
 5. Streptomyces species HIL-008003 (DSM 11641).  
 
     
 6. Mumbaistatin as claimed in claim 7 or claim 2, or the lactone L970880 as claimed in claim 3, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative of Mumbaistatin or the lactone, for use as a pharmaceutical.  
 
     
 7. A pharmaceutical composition, comprising an effective amount of Mumbaistatin as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, or the lactose L970860 as claimed in claim 3, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative of Mumbaistatin or the lactose, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.  
 
     
 8. Mumbaistatin as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, or the lactone L970860 as claimed in claim 3, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative of Mumbaistatin or the lactose, for use as an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate transiocase.  
 
     
 9. Mumbaistatin as claimed is claim 1 or claim 2, or the lactone L970860 as claimed in claim 3, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or derivative of Mumbaistatin or the lactose, for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
