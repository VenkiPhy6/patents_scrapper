 Wherein said coding has Acyl-coenzyme A: the polynucleotide of the separation of the polypeptide of lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity are operably connected at least one regulating and controlling sequence; Further, 
 Wherein said host cell also due to compared with contrast host cell Î” 9 extend the raising of enzymatic conversion efficiency and cause that there is the lipid that (i) has the weight percent of the EPA of increase, or (ii) has the dry cell weight of the weight percent of the EPA of increase. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. the recombinant host cell of claim 1, wherein said coding has Acyl-coenzyme A: the polynucleotide of the polypeptide of lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity are stably incorporated in described host cell. 
 
     
 3., for the preparation of the method for oil comprising timnodonic acid, described method comprises: 
 A) cultivate the recombinant host cell any one of claim 1 or 2, wherein produce the oil comprising timnodonic acid.
