 1. A method for modulating palatability in a subject in need of said modulating, comprising administering a  Bifidobacterium  bacterium in an effective amount for modulating palatability to said subject,
 wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is  Bifidobacterium breve  M-16V (NITE BP-02622), 
 wherein said modulating occurs via promotion of secretion of FGF21 in said subject, and 
 wherein modulating palatability is reducing the unbalanced types of diet, helping to take a wide variety of types of diet without faddiness, and adjusting the sense of taste. 
 
 
     
 2. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is comprised in a food or drink composition. 
 
     
 3. The method according to  claim 1 , wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is comprised in a pharmaceutical composition. 
 
     
 4. A method for maintaining body temperature in a subject in need of said maintaining, comprising administering a  Bifidobacterium  bacterium in an effective amount for maintaining body temperature to said subject,
 wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is  Bifidobacterium breve  M-16V (NITE BP-02622), and 
 wherein said maintaining occurs via promotion of secretion of FGF21 in said subject. 
 
 
     
 5. The method according to  claim 4 , wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is comprised in a food or drink composition. 
 
     
 6. The method according to  claim 4 , wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is comprised in a pharmaceutical composition. 
 
     
 7. A method of improving a sensitivity to cold in a subject in need of said improving, comprising administering a  Bifidobacterium  bacterium in an effective amount for improving the sensitivity cold, wherein the  Bifidobacterium  bacterium is  Bifidobacterium breve  M-16V (NITE BP-02622), and
 wherein said improving occurs via promotion of the secretion of FGF21 in said subject.
