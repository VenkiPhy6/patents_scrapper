 1. A process for producing an α-hydroxy acid from the corresponding α-hydroxy nitrile comprising 
 (a) contacting an α-hydroxy nitrile in a suitable aqueous reaction mixture with a catalyst characterized by a nitrilase activity derived from  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746); and  
 (b) isolating the α-hydroxy acid produced in (a) in the form of a salt or acid.  
 
     
 2. The process of  claim 1  wherein the catalyst is in the form of whole microbial cells. 
 
     
 3. A host cell transformed to express the nitrilase activity derived from  Acidovorax facilis  72W (ATCC 55746). 
 
     
 4. A process for producing an α-hydroxy acid from the corresponding α-hydroxy nitrile comprising 
 (a) contacting α-hydroxy nitrile in a suitable aqueous reaction mixture with the transformed host cell of  claim 3 ; and  
 (b) isolating the α-hydroxy acid produced in (a) in the form of a salt or acid.
