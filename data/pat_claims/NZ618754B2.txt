 2. An alfalfa plant or parts f comprising event KK179-2 produced by growing the seed of claim 1. 
 
     
 3. The alfalfa plant or parts thereof of claim 2, comprising pollen, ovule, flowers, shoots, roots or leaves. 
 
     
 4. A progeny plant or parts thereof an alfalfa plant of claim 2 wherein said progeny plant or parts thereof comprise alfalfa event KK179-2. 
 
     
 5. The progeny plant or parts thereof, of claim 4 r comprising pollen, ovule, flower, shoots, roots or leaves. 
 
     
 6. The alfalfa plant or seed or parts f of claim 4, the genome of which produces an amplicon comprising a DNA molecule selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:4. 
 
     
 7. A recombinant DNA molecule comprising a. a polynucleotide molecule selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2; b. a polynucleotide le with at least 90% identity to the full length of SEQ ID NO: 6; or c. a polynucleotide molecule complementary to a) or b). 
 
     
 8. The DNA molecule of claim 7, wherein a representative sample of seed comprising event KK179-2 has been deposited under ATCC Accession NO. PTA-11833. 
 
     
 9. The DNA molecule of claim 7, wherein said DNA molecule is an amplicon ed from a template molecule derived from DNA from event KK179-2. 
 
     
 10. A polynucleotide probe diagnostic for the presence of event 2 DNA, n said polynucleotide probe is of ient length to bind to a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 2, or ments thereof, and wherein said polynucleotide probe hybridizes under stringent ization conditions with a DNA molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, or SEQ ID NO: 2, or complements thereof and does not hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions with a DNA molecule not comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, or complements thereof. 
 
     
 11. A method of detecting the presence of a DNA molecule d from event KK179-2 in a DNA sample, the method sing: a. contacting said DNA sample with the cleotide probe of claim 6; b. subjecting said DNA sample and said polynucleotide probe to stringent hybridization conditions; and c. detecting ization of said polynucleotide probe to said DNA molecule derived from event KK179-2 in said DNA sample. 
 
     
 12. A pair of DNA molecules consisting of a first DNA molecule and a second DNA molecule different from the first DNA molecule, wherein said first and second DNA molecules comprise a polynucleotide molecule having a nucleotide sequence of sufficient length of utive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 6, or a complement thereof, to function as DNA primers when used together in an amplification reaction with a template derived from event KK179-2 to produce an amplicon diagnostic for event KK179-2 DNA in a sample. 
 
     
 13. A DNA detection kit comprising at least one polynucleotide molecule of sufficient length of consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 6, or complements thereof, to function as a DNA primer or polynucleotide probe specific for detecting the presence of DNA derived from event KK179-2, wherein detection of said DNA is diagnostic for the presence of said KK179-2 DNA in a sample. 
 
     
 14. The DNA detection kit of claim 13, wherein at least one polynucleotide molecule is selected from the group ting of SEQ ID NO: 1, and SEQ ID NO: 2.
