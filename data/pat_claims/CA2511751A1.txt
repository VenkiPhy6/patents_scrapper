 1. Recombinant microorganism for the preparation of D-amino acids starting from N-carbamoylamino acids or 5-monosubstituted hydantoins in which the gene which codes for a D-amino acid oxidase and/or the gene which codes for a D-serine dehydratase is inactivated by mutagenesis.  
 
     
 2. Microorganism according to claim 1, characterized in that it is an organism of the genus Escherichia coli.  
 
     
 3. Microorganism according to claim 1 and/or 2, characterized in that this has a D-carbamoylase gene from Agrobacterium sp., Arthrobacter sp. or Bacillus sp.  
 
     
 4. Escherichia coli DSM 15181 and mutants derived therefrom.  
 
     
 5. Escherichia coli DSM 15182 and mutants derived therefrom.  
 
     
 6. Process for the preparation of D-amino acids with a microorganism according to claim 1-5.  
 
     
 7. Process according to claim 6, characterized in that D-aminobutyric acid, D-serine, D-methionine, D-tryptophan and D-phenylalanine are prepared.
