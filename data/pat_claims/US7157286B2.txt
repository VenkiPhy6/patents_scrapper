 a step of reacting a specimen with a solid phased RCAS1 antibody obtained by binding to an insoluble support a first anti-RCAS1 antibody that specifically binds to RCAS1 to form a first reaction product when said anti-RCAS1 antibody binds RCAS1, reacting said first reaction product with a second anti-RCAS1 antibody labeled with a labeling substance to form a labeled first reaction product when said second anti-RCAS1 antibody binds RCAS1 of the first reaction product, and measuring a labeled amount of the produced first reaction product; 
 a step of producing a calibration curve by reacting said solid phased anti-RCAS1 antibody with a supernatant of SiSo cell culture or body fluid obtained from a cancer patient, which contains a second RCAS1 as a standard substance to form a second reaction product when said anti-RCAS1 antibody binds the second RCAS1, and measuring a labeled amount of the produced second reaction product; and 
 a step of quantitating RCAS1 in the specimen from a labeled amount of said first reaction product and said calibration curve; and 
 wherein said first anti-RCAS1 antibody is a monoclonal antibody which recognizes RCAS1 produced by a hybridoma having accession number of FERM BP-7002.
