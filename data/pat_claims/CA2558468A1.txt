 2. ~The method according to claim 1, wherein step (i) comprises bioleaching the mineral sulphide material at a pH of 0.8 or less.  
 
     
 3. ~The method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein step (i) comprises bioleaching the mineral sulphide material at a temperature of at least 60°C.  
 
     
 4. ~The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the mineral sulphide material contains ferrous iron and step (i) comprises bioleaching the mineral sulphide material by oxidising either or both of the ferrous iron and one or more sulphur compounds of the mineral sulphide material.  
 
     
 5. ~The method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the mineral sulphide material is a chalcopyrite-bearing ore or a pyritic ore which is capable of producing acid upon oxidation.  
 
     
 6. ~The method according to claim 5, wherein the mineral sulphide material is chalcopyrite.  
 
     
 7. The method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein step (i) comprises bioleaching the mineral sulphide material with the microorganism Acidianus sp. JP7 (Accession number DSM 15471).  
 
     
 8. ~The use of Acidianus sp. JP7 (DSM Accession number 15471) for bioleaching a mineral sulphide.  
 
     
 9. ~An isolated culture of Acidianus sp. JP7 (DSM      Accession number 15471).
