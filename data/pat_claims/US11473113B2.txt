 1. An isolated polynucleotide encoding a cAMP receptor protein variant, wherein glutamine is substituted for an amino acid at position 196 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein expression of the protein variant increases L-amino acid productivity. 
 
     
 2. A vector comprising the isolated polynucleotide of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 3. A microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  comprising a cAMP receptor protein variant, wherein glutamine is substituted for an amino acid at position 196 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. 
 
     
 4. The microorganism of  claim 3 , wherein the microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  is  Escherichia coli.    
 
     
 5. The microorganism of  claim 3 , wherein the microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  produces an L-amino acid. 
 
     
 6. The microorganism of  claim 5 , wherein the L-amino acid is L-threonine or L-tryptophan. 
 
     
 7. A method of producing an L-amino acid, the method comprising:
 culturing a microorganism of the genus  Escherichia  in a medium, the microorganism comprising a cAMP receptor protein variant wherein glutamine is substituted for an amino acid at position 196 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. 
 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 7 , further comprising collecting the L-amino acid from the microorganism or the medium. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 7 , wherein the L-amino acid is L-threonine or L-tryptophan.
