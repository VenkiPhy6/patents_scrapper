 [Claim 1] 
 A Genus Corynebacterium microorganism, expressing a membrane protein 
 derived from Shewanella atlantica of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a membrane protein having a 
 sequence homology of at least 75% or more thereto. 
 
     
 [Claim 2] 
 The Genus Corynebacterium microorganism according to claim 1, wherein in the 
 Genus Corynebacterium microorganism, a polynucleotide encoding the membrane 
 protein is introduced. 
 
     
 [Claim 3] 
 The Genus Corynebacterium microorganism according to claim 2, wherein the 
 polynucleotide is represented by SEQ ID NO: 2 or a nucleic acid sequence having a 
 sequence homology of at least 75% or more thereto. 
 
     
 [Claim 4] 
 The Genus Corynebacterium microorganism according to any one of claim 1 to 
 claim 3, wherein the productivity of L-amino acid is increased, compared to a Genus 
 Corynebacterium microorganism which does not express the membrane protein. 
 
     
 [Claim 5] 
 The Genus Corynebacterium microorganism according to claim 4, wherein the L 
 amino acid is L-lysine or L-arginine. 
 
     
 [Claim 6] 
 The Genus Corynebacterium microorganism according to any one of claim 1 to 
 claim 3, wherein the Genus Corynebacterium microorganism is Corynebacterium glutamicum. 
 
     
 [Claim 7] 
 A composition for producing L-amino acid, comprising the Genus 
 Corynebacterium microorganism according to any one of claim 1 to claim 3. 
 
     
 [Claim 8] 
 The composition according to claim 7, wherein the L-amino acid is L-lysine or L 
 arginine. 
 
     
 [Claim 9] 
 A method for production of L-amino acid, comprising 
 culturing the Genus Corynebacterium microorganism according to any one of 
 claim 1 to claim 3 in a medium, and 
 recovering L-amino acid from the cultured microorganism, medium or both of them. 
 
     
 [Claim 10] 
 The method according to claim 9, wherein the L-amino acid is L-lysine or L 
 arginine.
