 1. A method for producing polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), comprising (i) culturing in a culture medium comprising terephthalic acid and/or a salt thereof and/or an ester thereof one or more bacterial strains which are capable of accumulating PHA from terephthalic acid or a salt or ester thereof and which are selected from Pseudomonas putida strain GO 16 having the accession number NCIMB 41538, Pseudomonas putida strain GO 19 having the accession number NCIMB 41537, and Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis strain GO23 having the accession number NCIMB 41539; and (ii) recovering the PHA produced from the culture medium. 
 
 
 2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the culture medium comprises strain GO 19 and/or strain GO 16. 
 
 
 3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the PHA recovered from the culture medium comprises at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95% medium chain length (mcl) PHA. 
 
 
 4. A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein at least 80%, preferably 85%, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% of the mclPHA comprises repeating units of C8, 
 ClO and C 12 monomers. 
 
 
 5. A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the mclPHA comprises repeating units of C8, ClO and C 12 monomers in a respective amount by weight of mclPHA of 15% - 25% C8, 40% - 50% ClO and 30% - 40% C12. 
 
 
 6. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein a salt of terephthalic acid is present in the culture medium, and wherein, preferably, the salt is selected from alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts and mixtures thereof, especially sodium and potassium salts, and magnesium, calcium and barium salts.   
 
 
 7. A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the salt is a mono- or di- sodium or potassium salt of terephthalic acid. 
 
 
 8. A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the salt is monosodium terephthalate. 
 
 
 9. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein an ester of terephthalic acid is present in the culture medium, and wherein, preferably, the ester is selected from mono- and di- esters of terephthalic acid and mixtures thereof, especially mono- and di- Cl - C4 alkyl esters and mono- and di- glycol esters. 
 
 
 10. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the terephthalic acid or salt or ester thereof may be obtained from hydrolysis or pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), preferably pyrolysis of PET. 
 
 
 11. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the method comprises culturing the one or more strains in the culture medium for a period of from about 12 hours to about 72 hours, preferably from about 24 hours to about 60 hours, more preferably about 48 hours, at a temperature of from about 25 0 C to about 35 0 C, preferably about 3O 0 C. 
 
 
 12. A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the culture medium is nitrogen limited, with a maximum nitrogen content of about 0.5 g/1, preferably 0.067 g/1 culture medium. 
 
 
 13. Pseudomonas putida strain GO16 having the accession number NCIMB 41538. 
 
 
 14. Pseudomonas putida strain GO19 having the accession number NCIMB 41537. 
 
 
 15. Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis strain GO23 having the accession number NCIMB 41539.
