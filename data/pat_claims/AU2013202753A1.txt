A humanized antibody that specifically binds the same epitope or epitopes of human CD44 as the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line H460 16-2 having ATCC Accession No. PTA-4621, comprising: a heavy chain variable region comprising the complementarity determining region amino acid sequences ofS 1 1) N(IEQJI)N and SEQ N 0 and a light chain variable region comprising the complementarity determining region amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO.4, SEQ D NO:5, ot SEQ ID NO:6; and variable domain framework regions from the heavy and light chains of a human antibody or human antibody consensus framework; or a human CD44 binding fragment thereof. Claim 54. A humanized antibody that specifically binds human CD44, wherein said monoclonal antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region amino acid sequence of SEQ D NO7; and a light chain variable region amino acid sequence selected of S I1 No:8; or a human CD44 binding fragment thereof. Claim 55. A composition effective for treating a human pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, breast or colon tumor comprising in combination: an antibody or CDMAB of any one of claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, 49, 50 or 54; a conjugate of said antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, cytokines, interferons, target or reporter moieties and hematogenous cells; and a requisite amount of a pharmacologically acceptable carrier; wherein said composition is effective for treating said human breast or prostate tumor. Claim 56. A composition effective for treating a human breast or prostate tumor comprising in combination: an antibody or CDMAB of any one of claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, 49, 50 or 54 and a requisite amount of a pharmacologically acceptable carrier; wherein said composition is effective for treating said human breast or prostate tumor. - 88 WO 2008/144890 PCT/CA2008/000978 Claim 57. A composition effective for treating a human breast or prostate tumor comprising in combination: a conjugate of an antibody, antigen binding fragment, or CDMAB of any one of claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, 49, 50 or 54 with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, cytokines, interferons, target or reporter moieties and hematogenous cells; and a requisite amount of a pharmacologically acceptable carrier; wherein said composition is effective for treating said human breast or prostate tumor. Claim 58. An assay kit for detecting the presence of a human cancerous tumor, wherein said human cancerous tumor expresses at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the ATCC as accession number PTA-4621 or a CDMAB thereof, which CDMAB is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, the kit comprising the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the ATCC as accession number PTA-4621 or a CDMAB thereof, and means for detecting whether the monoclonal antibody, or a CDMAB thereof, is bound to a polypeptide whose presence, at a particular cut-off level, is diagnostic of said presence of said human cancerous tumor. 89
