 1. A strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae having accession number MTCC Y0022B211 (=NCYC 2647) which is useful for the production of ethanol by the fermentation of sugars. 
 
     
 2. A process for the preparation of a strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae having accession number MTCC Y0022B211 (=NCYC 2647), which comprises a. growing a diploid strain of S. cerevisiae designated MTCC Y0001 (=NCYC 2646), sporulating the strain, treating the sporulated cells with a lytic enzyme to liberate the sporulated cells, and collecting the liberated spores;   b. growing a haploid strain of S. cerevisiae designated MTCC Y0002 (=ATTC 90506) and collecting the cells;   c. mixing the spores obtained in step (a) with the cells obtained in step (b) and incubating the resultant spore-cell mixture at a temperature in the range of about 15° C. to about 37° C. for a period of about 1 to about 10 days;   d. spreading the incubated spore-cell mixture obtained in step (c) on a non-selective medium and incubating the mixture at a temperature in the range of about 15° C. to about 37° C. for a period of about 1 to about 10 days;   e. collecting the cells produced in step (d) and spreading the collected cells on a selective medium so as to eliminate the spores and cells of steps (a) and (b) and allow only hybrid cells to grow; and   f. purifying the hybrid cells.   
 
     
 3. A process as defined in claim 2, wherein the haploid strain MTCC Y0002 used in step (b) is selected from the group consisting of a haploid strain and haploid cells obtained from diploid strains. 
 
     
 4. A process as defined in claim 2, wherein the haploid strain in step (b) is grown in YEPD (Yeast extract, Peptone, Dextrose) medium at a temperature in the range of about 15° C. to about 35° C. for a period of about 1 to about 10 days. 
 
     
 5. A process as defined in claim 2, wherein the incubating in steps (c) and (d) is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 15° C. to about 37° C. for a time period in the range of about 1 to about 10 days. 
 
     
 6. A process as defined in claim 2, wherein the selective medium used in step (e) is SDG (yeast nitrogen base, dextrose, glycerol, agar and distilled water) medium fortified with a broad-range antibiotic selected from the group consisting of geniticin, oligomycin, chloramphenicol, and combinations thereof.
