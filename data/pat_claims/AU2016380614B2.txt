 [Claim 11 A method for screening for an antimicrobial agent 
 in an air-conditioning system to remove odors generated in 
 the air-conditioning system from at least one microorganism 
 selected from the group consisting of Pelomonas puraquae, 
 Spirosoma radiotolerans, Fibrella aestuarina, 
 Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma linguale, and 
 Geobacillus toebii, the method comprising: (a) preparing 
 the microorganism or a culture solution thereof; 
 (b) bringing the microorganism or a culture solution 
 thereof into contact with a sample; 
 (c) measuring growth inhibition of the microorganism; 
 and 
 (d) considering the sample to have antibacterial 
 activity to reduce odors in an air-conditioning system, when 
 growth of the microorganism is inhibited. 
 
     
 [Claim 21 The method according to claim 1, wherein the air 
 conditioning system is an air conditioner. 
 
     
 [Claim 3] The method according to claim 1, wherein the 
 microorganism forms a biofilm in the evaporator core in the 
 air-conditioning system to induce odors. 
 
     
 [Claim 4] The method according to claim 3, wherein a material 
 for the evaporator core is aluminum, an aluminum alloy, 
 copper or a copper alloy. 
 
     
 [Claim 5] The method according to claim 1, wherein 
 the Pelomonas puraquae is Pelomonas puraquae HKMC-113 
 (accession number: KCCM11689P), the Spirosoma radiotolerans 
 is Spirosoma radiotolerans HKMC-114 (accession number: 
 KCCM11690P), the Fibrella aestuarina is Fibrella aestuarina 
 HKMC-115 (accession number: KCCM11691P), the Chryseobacterium 
 geocarposphaerae is Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae HKMC 
 116 (accession number: KCCM11692P), the Spirosoma linguale is 
 Spirosoma linguale HKMC-117 (accession number: KCCM11693P), 
 and the Geobacillus toebii is Geobacillus toebii HKMC-118 
 (accession number: KCCM11694P). 
 
     
 [Claim 6] A method for removing odors in an air-conditioning 
 system comprising, from the air-conditioning system, 
 isolating or removing at least one odor-causing 
 microorganism selected from the group consisting of 
 Pelomonas puraquae, Spirosoma radiotolerans, Fibrella 
 aestuarina, Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma 
 linguale, and Geobacillus toebii. 
 
     
 [Claim 7] A method for removing odors in an air-conditioning 
 system comprising, from the air-conditioning system, inhibiting growth of at least one odor-causing microorganism selected from the group consisting of Pelomonas puraquae, 
 Spirosoma radiotolerans, Fibrella aestuarina, 
 Chryseobacterium geocarposphaerae, Spirosoma linguale, and 
 Geobacillus toebii.
