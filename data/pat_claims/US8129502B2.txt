 8. The isolated antibody of any one of  claim 1 ,  2 , or  3  conjugated with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, and hematogenous cells. 
 
     
 9. A composition, comprising in combination:
 an antibody of any one of  claim 1 ,  2 , or  3 ; and 
 a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 
 
     
 10. A composition, comprising in combination:
 the isolated antibody of any one of  claim 1 ,  2 , or  3  conjugated with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, and hematogenous cells; and 
 a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 
 
     
 11. The antigen binding fragment of any one of  claim 5 ,  6 , or  7  conjugated with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, and hematogenous cells. 
 
     
 12. A composition, comprising in combination:
