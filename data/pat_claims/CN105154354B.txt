XHS0032Xh, which is characterized in that described streptomyces microflavus (Streptomyces microflavus) the XHS0032Xh preservations
Number is CGMCC NO.9432. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. streptomyces microflavus (Streptomyces microflavus) XHS0032Xh as described in claim 1, feature exist
In the streptomyces microflavus (Streptomyces microflavus) XHS0032Xh gene orders such as SEQ ID NO.1 institutes
Show. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. streptomyces microflavus (Streptomyces microflavus) XHS0032Xh as described in claim 1 is in greenhouse
Application in soil remediation. 
 
     
 4. a kind of greenhouse soil remediation group agent, which is characterized in that the greenhouse soil remediation group agent passes through as follows
Preparation method obtains： 
 (1) it is inoculated with：Prepare streptomyces microflavus (Streptomyces microflavus) XHS0032Xh CGMCC NO.9432,
The solid medium of four kinds of micrococcus luteus, Pasteur bacillus and Candida tropicalis strains, strictly carries out after sterilizing
Sterile working is forwarded to tablet from inclined-plane, is cultivated 3 days at 30 DEG C of temperature； 
 (2) level-one culture：It is forwarded to the 50mL equipped with fluid nutrient medium from picking single bacterium colony on the solid medium in step (1)
In conical flask, sterile working, 30 DEG C, 120r/min cultures -48h for 24 hours； 
 (3) second order fermentation：Above-mentioned steps (2) level-one culture strain is inoculated in the 500mL conical flasks for filling fluid nutrient medium,
Sterile working, 30 DEG C, 120r/min cultures -48h for 24 hours； 
 (4) compatibility of strain fermentating liquid：It is assessed according to weight part ratio, streptomyces microflavus prepared by optional step (3)
70 parts -85 parts of the second order fermentation liquid of (Streptomyces microflavus) XHS0032Xh CGMCC NO.9432, gamboge are micro-
20 parts -35 parts of coccus second order fermentation liquid, 25 parts -40 parts of Pasteur bacillus second order fermentation liquid and Candida tropicalis two level
15 parts -30 parts of zymotic fluid is mixed, and the mixed liquor of composite bacteria is prepared； 
 (5) auxiliary material is added：Composite bacteria mixed liquor prepared by step (4) is fully adsorbed in carrier, carrier selects greenhouse big
Canopy soil；Auxiliary material uses urea and calcium superphosphate, and the wherein weight ratio of urea and calcium superphosphate is 1:2.5；Carrier and auxiliary material
Dosage is 1 according to weight ratio:3 proportioning mixing, add water to water content 40-70%, then by volume every cubic metre of carrier with it is auxiliary
Composite bacteria mixed liquor 100-300g prepared by above-mentioned steps (4) is added in material mixing materials, and is uniformly mixed, and prepares greenhouse
Plastic shed soil reparation group agent； 
 (6) the greenhouse soil remediation group agent for preparing step (5) composting at 28-30 DEG C of air themperature；Composting is to cover
Carried out under lid straw screen or mat, it is primary that composting starts rear every turning in 30 days, when turning moisturizing continue to water content 40-70%, composting time
120 days；Soil can be directly applied to after the completion of composting after airing to drying. 
 
     
 
   
 
 5. application of the greenhouse soil remediation group agent as claimed in claim 4 in greenhouse soil remediation.
