   1 . A method of preventing or reducing mycotoxin contamination in a food or food product by treating the food or food product with bacteria as defined by accession number 040408-01 filed with the International Depository Authority of Canada. 
 
     
   2 . The method as defined in  claim 1 , wherein the mycotoxin contamination comprises trichothecene mycotoxins. 
 
     
   3 . The method of  claim 2 , wherein the trichothecene mycotoxins comprise deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin). 
 
     
   4 . A method of screening for microorganisms that are capable of reducing deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin) comprising,
 a) obtaining a soil sample;   b) culturing bacteria in the soil sample under conditions to enrich for bacteria that are capable of reducing deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin);   c) isolating one or more single colonies of bacteria from the step of culturing (step b), and;   d) individually testing the one or more single colonies in an assay to confirm if the colony or colonies are capable of reducing deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin).   
 
     
   5 . The method of  claim 4 , further comprising culturing, purifying, isolating or any combination thereof the one or more single colonies that are capable of reducing deoxynivalenol (DON or vomitoxin). 
 
     
   6 . The method of  claim 4 , wherein the step b) is preceded by a step of extracting bacteria from the soil sample.
