Claim 33. Use of monoclonal antibodies for reduction of human tumor burden, wherein said human tumor expresses at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the IDAC as accession number 051206-01 or an antibody-ligand thereof, which antibody-ligand is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, comprising administering to said mammal said monoclonal antibody or antibody-ligand thereof in an amount effective to result in a reduction of said mammal's human tumor burden. Claim 34. The method of claim 33 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. Claim 35. The method of claim 34 wherein said cytotoxic moiety is a radioactive isotope. Claim 36. The method of claim 33 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or antibody-ligand thereof activates complement. Claim 37. The method of claim 33 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or antibody-ligand thereof mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. 50 WO 2008/089567 PCT/CA2008/000151 Claim 38. The method of claim 33 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is a humanized version of the isolated monoclonal antibody. Claim 39. The method of claim 33 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is a chimeric version of the isolated monoclonal antibody. Claim 40. Use of monoclonal antibodies for reduction of human tumor burden, wherein said human tumor expresses at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the IDAC as accession number 051206-01 or an antibody-ligand thereof, which antibody-ligand is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, comprising administering to said mammal said monoclonal antibody or CDMAB thereof; in conjunction with at least one chemotherapeutic agent in an amount effective to result in a reduction of said mammal's human tumor burden. Claim 41. The method of claim 40 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. Claim 42. The method of claim 41 wherein said cytotoxic moiety is a radioactive isotope. Claim 43. The method of claim 40 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or antibody-ligand thereof activates complement. Claim 44. The method of claim 40 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody or antibody-ligand thereof mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Claim 45. The method of claim 40 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is a humanized version of the isolated monoclonal antibody. Claim 46. The method of claim 40 wherein said isolated monoclonal antibody is a chimeric version of the isolated monoclonal antibody. Claim 47. A composition effective for treating a human cancerous tumor comprising in combination: 51 WO 2008/089567 PCT/CA2008/000151 an antibody or antibody-ligand of any one of claims 1,2,3,6,7,8, or 17; a conjugate of said antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof with a member selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic moieties, enzymes, radioactive compounds, cytokines, interferons, target or reporter moieties and hematogenous cells; and a requisite amount of a pharmacologically acceptable carrier; wherein said composition is effective for treating said human cancerous tumor. Claim 48. An assay kit for detecting the presence of a human cancerous tumor, wherein said human cancerous tumor expresses at least one epitope of an antigen which specifically binds to the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the IDAC as accession number 051206-01 or an antibody-ligand thereof, which antibody-ligand is characterized by an ability to competitively inhibit binding of said isolated monoclonal antibody to its target antigen, the kit comprising the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the IDAC as accession number 051206-01 or an antibody ligand thereof, and means for detecting whether the isolated monoclonal antibody, or an antibody-ligand thereof, is bound to a polypeptide whose presence, at a particular cut-off level, is diagnostic of said presence of said human cancerous tumor. 52
