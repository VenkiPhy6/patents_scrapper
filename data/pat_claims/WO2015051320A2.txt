 wherein said second antibody specifically binds to an antigen selected from a group consisting of: Tyrosinase, MART-1, S 100, and any combination thereof.  
  107. An immunoassay method for detecting SOXIO protein in an animal or human comprising the steps of:  
  obtaining tissue from an animal or human to be tested;  
  contacting said tissue with an antibody or fragment thereof according to claim 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 21, 22, 28, or 29, in an amount and under conditions such that said antibody or fragment thereof binds to a SOX10 protein if said protein is present in said tissue; and  
  detecting the presence of said bound antibodies.  
  108. An immunoassay method for detecting SOX10 protein in an animal or human according to claim 107 and further comprising the step of fixing or freezing said tissue.  
  109. An immunoassay method for detecting SOX10 protein in an animal or human according to claim 108 and further comprising the step of treating said fixed or frozen tissue to unmask epitopes to SOX10.  
  110. An immunoassay method for detecting SOX10 protein according to claim 107 and further comprising detecting said SOX10 protein in said animal or human with a method selected from a group consisting of immunohistochemistry (IHC), IHC of FFPE, IHC of frozen-tissue sections, immunocytochemistry, and ELISA.  
  111. An isolated preparations of antibodies which specifically bind to a SOX10 protein wherein said antibodies bind to an epitope selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 3 (residues 196-211 of a SOX10 protein).
