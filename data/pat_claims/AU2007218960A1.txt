A process for treating a human cancerous tumor which expresses human CD59 antigen comprising: administering to an individual suffering from said human cancer, at least one monoclonal antibody or ligand that recognizes the same epitope or epitopes as those recognized by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma selected from the group consisting of hybridoma cell line 10A304.7 having ATCC Accession No. PTA-5065 and hybridoma cell line AR36A36.11.1 having IDAC Accession No. 280104-02; in conjunction with at least one chemotherapeutic agent; wherein said administration is effective in reducing tumor burden. Claim 6. A binding assay to determine a presence of cancerous cells which express an epitope or epitopes of CD59 in a tissue sample selected from a human tumor comprising: providing a tissue sample from said human tumor; providing at least one monoclonal antibody or ligand that recognizes the same epitope or epitopes as those recognized by the isolated monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma selected from the group consisting of hybridoma cell line 10A304.7 having ATCC Accession No. PTA-5065 and hybridoma cell line AR36A36.11.1 having IDAC Accession No. 280104-02; contacting said at least one monoclonal antibody or ligand thereof with said tissue sample; and determining binding of said at least one monoclonal antibody or ligand thereof with said tissue sample; whereby the presence of said cancerous cells in said tissue sample is indicated. 49
