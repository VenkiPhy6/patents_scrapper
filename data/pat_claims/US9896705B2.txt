 1. A method for producing D-tagatose, the method comprising converting D-galactose into D-tagatose by an arabinose isomerase variant having an increased activity of converting D-galactose into D-tagatose, the arabinose isomerase variant having a substitution of an amino acid other than phenylalanine for an amino acid at position 275 and a substitution of proline for an amino acid at position 469 of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. 
 
     
 2. The method for producing D-tagatose of  claim 1 , wherein the substitution of the amino acid for the amino acid at position 275 is any one amino acid selected from the group consisting of valine, methionine and isoleucine. 
 
     
 3. The method for producing D-tagatose of  claim 1 , the method comprising reacting a solution containing the D-galactose with a metal ion source selected from the group consisting of manganese ions, magnesium ions and zinc ions in the presence of the arabinose isomerase variant. 
 
     
 4. The method for producing D-tagatose of  claim 3 , wherein the metal ion source is contained at a concentration of 0.1 mM to 10 mM.
