 a) a polypeptide comprising amino acids 1-438 of SEQ ID NO: 48: 
 b) a polypeptide having at least 95% identity to a polypeptide comprising amino acids 1-438 of SEQ ID NO: 48 and having adenylating amide synthetase activity; and 
 c) a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide, the complement of which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising amino acids 1-438 of SEQ ID NO: 48, wherein said stringent hybridization conditions comprise: (i) hybridization in 5×SCC at 65° C. for 16 hours, (ii) two washes in 2×SSC at room temperature for 15 minutes for each wash, and (iii) two washes in 0.5×SSC at 65° C. for 20 minutes for each wash.
