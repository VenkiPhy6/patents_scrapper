           lactobacilluscasei ) WWMR-1, it is characterized in that, lactobacterium casei (
           lactobacilluscasei ) culture presevation of WWMR-1 is numbered CGMCCNo.8244.
         
 
     
 2. a method for mare milk vinegar is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation, it is characterized in that, concrete preparation method's step is as follows: 
 (1) preparation of seed fermentation liquid and female fermented liquid: seed fermentation liquid: by 4 DEG C preserve bacterial classification lactobacterium casei (
           lactobacilluscasei ) WWMR-1CGMCCNo.8244, Kluyveromyces marxianus bacterium (
           kluyveromycesmarxianus ) and acetic bacteria (
           aceticacidbacteria ) be inoculated in respectively in an aseptic environment in MRS substratum, YPD substratum and AS1.41 substratum and activate, be placed in respectively 37 DEG C cultivate 24h, 28 DEG C cultivate 48h and 30 DEG C and cultivate 48h, use in order to the later stage; Female fermented liquid: the mare's milk that pre-treatment is good is sub-packed in fermenting container, aseptically, the milk-acid bacteria activated, yeast and acetic bacteria seed fermented liquid are accessed in fermenting container by 5% inoculum size, be placed in 37 DEG C respectively and cultivate 24h, 28 DEG C of cultivations 48h and 30 DEG C of cultivation 48h, use in order to the later stage;
         
 (2) mare's milk pre-treatment: by fresh the mare's milk impurity in four layers of filtered through gauze removing mare's milk and foreign matter, then mare's milk is preheating to 65 DEG C, homogeneous 5min under 20MPa condition; After homogeneous, mare's milk is carried out pasteurize, place and be cooled to room temperature, treat that fermentation is used; 
 (3) zymamsis: add in mare's milk prepared by step (2) after the milk-acid bacteria of step (1) being prepared mixes according to volume ratio 3: 5 with saccharomycetes to make fermentation liquid, add glucose, sugaring amount is added according to 8g/100ml, at 32 DEG C, 135r/min, cultivate 80h, obtain the mare's milk alcohol fermentation liquid that alcoholic strength is 7% (V/V); 
 (4) acetic fermentation: according to volume basis, the acetic bacteria (Aceticacidbacteria) step (1) prepared is by the alcohol fermentation liquid prepared in step (3) of inoculum size of 10%, require that alcohol initial alcohol degree is 7%, leavening temperature is 33 DEG C, 135r/min, cultivate 5 days, obtain the mare's milk acetic acid fermentation liquid that acidity is 120 ° of T; 
 (5) aftertreatment: after product to fermentation termination, acidity, at 120 ° of T, carries out pasteurize, carries out sterile filling and prepare mare milk vinegar after cooling. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. the method for mare milk vinegar is prepared in composite bacteria mixed fermentation as claimed in claim 2, and it is characterized in that, described MRS substratum, YPD substratum and AS1.41 substratum are respectively: 
 (1) MRS substratum: glucose 20g, peptone 10g, extractum carnis 10g, yeast extract paste 5g, citric acid diamines 2g, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 2g, sodium acetate 5g, magnesium sulfate 0.58g, manganous sulfate 0.25g, tween-80 1mL, distilled water 1000mL; 
 (2) YPD substratum: yeast extract paste 10g, peptone 20g, glucose 20g, distilled water 1000mL; 
 (3) AS1.41 substratum: glucose 10g, yeast extract paste 10g, calcium carbonate 15g, agar 20g, dehydrated alcohol 20ml, distilled water 1000mL. 
 
     
 
   
 
 4. the mare milk vinegar prepared of composite bacteria mixed fermentation method as claimed in claim 2.
