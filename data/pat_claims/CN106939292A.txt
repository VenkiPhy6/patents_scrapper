 3. a kind of clearing lung-heat removes haze camel lactic acid drink, it is characterised in that in parts by weight, including 100 part -150 of bactrian camel milk
Part, 3 parts -9 parts of xylitol, 16 parts -20 parts of Qamgur leaching liquor, Kuru wood carry 16 parts -20 parts of leaching liquor, 11 part -13 of water chestnut juice
Part, 3 parts -10 parts of white turnip juice, 3 parts -5 parts of galactococcus mixed culture fermentation agent, 1 part -3 parts of fragrance bacterium mixed culture fermentation agent, pure water 700
- 1100 parts of part. 
 
     
 
   
 
 4. a kind of clearing lung-heat as claimed in claim 3 removes haze camel lactic acid drink, it is characterised in that described galactococcus mixing hair
Ferment agent is by fragrance bacterium（ Myroides sp .）L6 and galactococcus（ Lactococcus sp .）L122 is according to weight ratio with 2：5
Ratio is compound to be made. 
 
     
 
   
 
 5. a kind of clearing lung-heat as claimed in claim 3 removes haze camel lactic acid drink, it is characterised in that described fragrance bacterium mixing hair
Ferment agent is by fragrance bacterium（ Myroides sp .）L6 and galactococcus（ Lactococcus sp .）L122 is according to weight ratio with 3：1
Ratio is compound to be made. 
 
     
 6. a kind of clearing lung-heat is except the preparation method of the camel lactic acid drink of haze, it is characterised in that specifically include following steps： 
 （1）Prepare acidified milk：100-150 part bactrian camel milks of fresh collection carry out sterilization treatment by the way of pasteurize, go out
- 80 DEG C of bacterium temperature 70 C, sterilization time 5s-10s is rapidly cooled to room temperature after sterilizing, add 3-9 parts of xylitols, is inoculated with 3-5 parts
Galactococcus mixed culture fermentation agent, ferment initial stage 6h-8h at 40 DEG C -41 DEG C, and post drop is inoculated with 1-3 parts of fragrance to 33 DEG C -35 DEG C
Bacterium mixed culture fermentation agent, ferment 1-1.5h under the conditions of 33 DEG C -35 DEG C, obtains camel acidified milk, described galactococcus mixed fermentation
Agent is by fragrance bacterium（ Myroides sp .）L6 and galactococcus（ Lactococcus sp .）L122 is according to weight ratio with 2：5 ratio
Example is compound to be made, and described fragrance bacterium mixed culture fermentation agent is by fragrance bacterium（ Myroides sp .）L6 and galactococcus
（ Lactococcus sp .）L122 is according to weight ratio with 3：1 ratio is compound to be made； 
 （2）Prepare leaching liquor：Qamgur after cleaning, Kuru wood are carried and is cut into small pieces, 3 times of pure water are added respectively, it is slow to add
Heat, is incubated extraction under conditions of 90 DEG C -100 DEG C, and extraction time is 30min-40min, and extracting times are 2-3 times, repeatedly leaching
Filtered after carrying, obtain Qamgur leaching liquor and Kuru wood carries leaching liquor, be cooled to room temperature standby； 
 (3) water chestnut juice and white turnip juice are prepared：Water chestnut after ternip after cleaning and cleaning peeling is cut into small pieces, is separately added into
2 times of pure water are squeezed the juice broken, and through 40 mesh concussion sieve filter 23 time, the ultra high temperature short time sterilization 15s under conditions of 120 DEG C of temperature is obtained
To water chestnut juice and white turnip juice, room temperature is cooled to standby； 
 （4）Mixing：Camel acidified milk that above-mentioned steps are obtained, 16 parts of -20 portions of Qamgur leaching liquors, 16 parts of -20 parts of Kuru wood
Carry leaching liquor, 11-13 part water chestnut juice and 3-10 parts of white turnip juices carry out mixing stirring, camel lactic acid drink is made through mixing. 
 
     
 
   
 
 7. a kind of clearing lung-heat as claimed in claim 6 removes the preparation method of haze camel lactic acid drink, it is characterised in that described system
Sterilising temp in preparation kefir milk step is 75 DEG C, and sterilization time is 8s, and fermentation temperature is 41 DEG C during initial stage, and fermentation time is
7h。 
 
     
 
   
 
 8. a kind of clearing lung-heat as claimed in claim 6 removes the preparation method of haze camel lactic acid drink, it is characterised in that prepare extraction
Insulation extraction temperature in liquid step is 95 DEG C, and extraction time is 35min, and extracting times are 3 times. 
 
     
 9. a kind of clearing lung-heat is preparing the application during clearing lung-heat removes haze medicine except haze camel lactic acid drink. 
 
     
 10. a kind of clearing lung-heat is preparing the application during clearing lung-heat removes haze food and drink except haze camel lactic acid drink.
