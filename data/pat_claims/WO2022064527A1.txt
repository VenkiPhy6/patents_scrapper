 6. The bio-substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein said stabilizing agent is a carbohydrate.  
 
 
 7. The bio-substrate as claimed in claim 6, wherein said carbohydrate is selected from the group consisting of dextrose, sucrose, trehalose or raffinose.  
 
 
 8. The bio-substrate as claimed in claim any of the claims 1, 6 and 7, wherein the stabilizing agent is selected from 1% trehalose; 0.5 polyethylene glycol (6000) and 0.5% Lactose/sucrose.  
 
 
 9. The bio substrate as claimed in any of the previous claims, wherein said bio substrate comprising wood powder or turnings, Rice husk, Isabgol Husk and Rye/wheat grain in 

 ratio of 0.75:1.00:0.75:0.5 w/w, freshly prepared potato dextrose broth (PDB) comprising of 5% (v/w) and stabilizing agents.  
 
 
 10. A bio formulation comprising the bio substrate as claimed in any of the claims 1-9 and a culture of Muscodor kashayam (MTCC-25403).  
 
 
 11. The bio formulation as claimed in claim 10, wherein the culture of Muscodor kashayam (MTCC-25403) produces a mixture of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).  
 
 
 12. The bio-formulation as claimed in claim 10, wherein said formulation is in the form of a wettable powder (WP), an emulsifiable concentrates, gel, pellets or soluble liquids.  
 
 
 13. The bio-formulation as claimed in claim 10, wherein said formulation is in the form of a filter paper, pad or sachet.  
 
 
 14. The bio-formulation as claimed in claim 10, wherein said formulation comprises a mixture of volatile compounds (VOCs) comprising: i. 3-cyclohexen-1-ol, 1-(1,5-dimethyl-4-hexenyl)-4-methyl- (Synonym: β-Bisabolol); ii. 2,6-Bis (1, -dimethylethyl)-4-(l -oxypropyl) phenol; iii. 1,6- Dioxacyclododecane-7, 12-dione; iv. 2,3-dihydro-1,1-dimethyl-6-tert-butyl-1H-indene-4-acetic acid; v. 2,4-Di-tert-butylthiophenol; vi. 4-Octadecylmorpholine and, vii. 2-(4-morpholinyl) ethanamine.  
 
 
 15. The bio-formulation as claimed in claim 10, wherein said formulation is effective in enhancing the shelf life of fruits, vegetables and grains such as Strawberry’s, Apples, Grapes, Mandarins, Oranges, Guavas, Mangoes, Lychees, Tomatoes, Onions, Okra, pulses, chickpea, wheat and rice.  
 
 
 16. A method for preparing a bio-formulation comprising the steps of:  
 I. growing a culture of Muscodor preferably in fresh potato dextrose broth (FPDB); 

 II. incubating the culture with agitation and aeration, at a temperature between 23-33 °C and pH between 3-7, for 3-14 days;  
 III. mixing the harvested Muscodor kashayum culture grown at step I, with the composite sterile bio-substrate along with the broth;  
 IV. incubating the mixture obtained from step HI for 1-10 days; 
 V. adding a stabilizing agent; and  
 VI. drying the formulation with sterile air between 28-35 °C  
 
 
 17. A method of inhibiting the growth of a microorganisms in post-harvest products, said method comprising the delivery of the composition of naturally produced VOC’s through the bioformulation as claimed in claim 9.  
 
 
 18. A method of protecting and enhancing the shelf life of fruits, vegetables, seeds and grains from infestation by a microorganism viz. fungus, a bacterium, a yeast or an actinomycetes, wherein the method comprises delivery of the composition of naturally produced VOC’s through the bio-formulation as claimed in claim 9, causing a delayed process of ripening of fruits and vegetables apart from antimicrobial action thereby extending their shelf life.  
 
 
 19. A novel strain of Muscodor kashayum with the deposition number MTCC 25403.
