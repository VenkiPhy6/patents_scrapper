 1. A method for producing ethanol, comprising: placing flocculent Zymomonas mobilis "f" NRRL B-12526 in a reactor column; and   passing a stream containing water, sugar, and yeast extract through said reactor column at a flow rate which permits conversion of sugar in said stream to ethanol in said column and retention of said flocculent Zymomonas mobilis "f" NRRL B-12526 in said reactor column.   
 
     
 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the sugar in said stream is glucose. 
 
     
 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said stream contains about 5 to about 17 grams of glucose and about 0.5 gram of yeast extract per 100 milliliters of water. 
 
     
 4. A means for producing ethanol, comprising: a tubular vessel through which is passed a stream containing water, sugar, and yeast extract, the longitudinal axis of said vessel being disposed at an angle of about 45Â° relative to a horizontal plane;   a plurality of gas venting conduits attached to and spaced apart along said vessel and communicating with the interior thereof, free ends of said gas venting conduits terminating at a level substantially even with or above the upper end of said vessel; and   a flocculent mass of Zymomonas mobilis "f" NRRL B-12526 disposed in said vessel for converting said sugar to ethanol.
