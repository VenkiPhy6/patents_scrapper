 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What is claimed is: 
   
   1 . An elite  Thlaspi  variety comprising a reduced seedpod shatter trait and/or early maturity trait of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032, representative seed of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032 having been deposited under NCMA Accession Number 202210002. 
 
     
   2 . The variety of  claim 1 , wherein the variety lacks the black seed trait, high fiber seed trait, increased lodging trait, wild-type seed sinigrin content, wild-type seed erucic acid content, and/or reduced yield trait of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032. 
 
     
   3 . A plant of the variety of  claim 1 . 
 
     
   4 . A part of the plant of  claim 3 , wherein the part comprises a microspore, pollen, ovary, ovule, embryo sac, egg cell, cutting, root, stem, cell or protoplast. 
 
     
   5 . Seed of the plant of  claim 3 . 
 
     
   6 . A tissue culture of regenerable cells or protoplasts from the plant of  claim 3 . 
 
     
   7 . The tissue culture as claimed in  claim 6 , wherein the cells or protoplasts of the tissue culture are derived from a tissue comprising a leaf, pollen, embryo, cotyledon, hypocotyl, meristematic cell, root, root tip, anther, flower, seed, or stem. 
 
     
   8 . The variety of  claim 2 , wherein the variety is 182002-B-B-31, representative seed of  Thlaspi arvense  variety 182002-B-B-31 having been deposited under NCMA Accession Number 202210001. 
 
     
   9 . A method for producing an elite  Thlaspi  plant variety comprising a reduced seedpod shatter trait and/or an early maturity trait, the method comprising:
 (a) crossing a plant of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032, representative seed of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032 having been deposited under NCMA Accession Number 202210002 with a second  Thlaspi  plant from a wild cultivar or an elite variety lacking the reduced seedpod shatter trait and/or an early maturity trait, to create population of progeny plants;   (b) selecting from the progeny plants a plant with a reduced seedpod shatter and/or an early maturity trait; and   (c) repeating steps (a) and (b) for a sufficient number of times so that an elite variety is created with the reduced seedpod shatter trait and/or an early maturity trait.   
 
     
   10 . A method of producing a  Thlaspi  variety with reduced seed pod shattering and/or early maturity comprising:
 (a) obtaining a plant of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032, representative seed of  Thlaspi arvense  cultivar 2032 having been deposited under NCMA Accession Number 202210002; and   (b) using the same as a source of breeding material in a plant breeding program.   
 
     
   11 . A method of producing a commodity plant product comprising:
 (a) obtaining the plant of  claim 3 , or a plant part thereof, and   (b) producing the commodity plant product from the plant or plant part thereof, wherein the commodity plant product is an oil, biodegradable plastic, lubricant, biofuel, food or feed product, medicinal product, or a combination thereof.   
 
     
   12 . The method of  claim 11 , wherein a plant part is obtained, wherein the plant part is a seed, and wherein the commodity plant product is oil or biofuel. 
 
     
   13 . The method of  claim 11 , wherein a plant part is obtained, wherein the plant part is a seed, and wherein the commodity plant product is a feed product.
