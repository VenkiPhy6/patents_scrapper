 1. A biologically pure culture of bacillus defined by accession number 180507-1 of the International Depository Authority of Canada which detoxifies trichothene mycotoxins.  
 
     
 2. A composition comprising the culture according to claim 1 and a carrier.  
 
     
 3. The composition according to claim 2, wherein the carrier is a medium that promotes survival of the bacillus.  
 
     
 4. The composition according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the carrier is a medium that promotes growth of the bacillus.  
 
     
 5. The composition according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the medium is a cell culture medium.  
 
     
 6. The composition according to claim 3, wherein the carrier is a food or food product contaminated or susceptible to contamination by trichothecene mycotoxins or organisms that produce trichothecene mycotoxins.  
 
     
 7. The composition according to claim 3 on a crop or harvested crop that is contaminated or susceptible to contamination by trichothecene mycotoxins or organisms that produce trichothecene mycotoxins.  
 
     
 8. The composition of claim 6 or 7, wherein the trichothecene mycotoxin comprises deoxynivalenol.  
 
     
 9. A method of preventing or reducing mycotoxin contamination in a food or food product by treating the food or food product with the culture as defined in claim 1.  
 
     
 10. A method of preventing or reducing mycotoxin contamination in a crop or harvested crop by treating the crop or harvested crop with the culture as defined in claim 1.  
 
     
 11. The method according to claim 9 or 10, wherein the mycotoxin contamination comprises trichothecene mycotoxins.  
 
     
 12. The method of claim 11, wherein the trichothecene mycotoxins comprise deoxynivalenol.  
 
     
 13. The method according to claim 12, wherein an efficiency of transformation from deoxynivalenol (DON) to de-epoxy deoxynivalenol (DOM) is defined by: DON to DOM (%) = -783.228 + 165.854c + 24.895d - 0.049D0N - 7.794c2 - 2.214cd -0.185d2 + 0.000556cDON + 0.0000692dDON + 0.000109DON2, wherein c is the concentration of the culture; d is the length of incubation;  and DON is the concentration of DON.  
 
     
 14. A food additive comprising the culture according to claim 1.  
 
     
 15. Use of the composition according to claim 2 for treatment of mycotoxin contaminated food or food products.  
 
     
 16. Use of the composition according to claim 2 for treatment of mycotoxin contaminated crop or harvested crop.  
 
     
 17. The use according to claim 15 or 16, wherein mycotoxin contamination comprises trichothecene mycotoxins.  
 
     
 18. The use of claim 16, wherein the mycotoxin contaminated crop or harvested crop comprises deoxynivalenol.  
 
     
 19. A kit comprising the culture as defined in claim 1 and one or more of the following: a) one or more carriers for holding/retaining, suspending, diluting, adhering, enveloping, culturing, growing, freezing/cryopreserving, or producing active metabolites from the bacillus; b) one or more devices for combining or formulating the bacillus with the one or more carriers of a); c) one or more devices for treating a food or food product with the bacillus or a composition comprising the bacillus, and; d) instructions for growing the bacillus, formulating the bacillus with the one or more carriers, using one or more devices for treating a food or food product, or a combination thereof.
