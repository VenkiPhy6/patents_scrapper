It is, the geotrichum candidum（Geotrichum Candidum）XHS0030B deposit number is CGMCC NO.9435. 
 
     
 
   
 
 2. geotrichum candidum as described in claim 1（Geotrichum Candidum）The rDNA ITS section gene sequence of XHS0030B
Column such as SEQ ID NO.1. 
 
     
 
   
 
 3. geotrichum candidum as described in claim 1（Geotrichum Candidum）XHS0030B is in greenhouse soil remediation
Application. 
 
     
 4. a kind of greenhouse soil remediation group agent, which is characterized in that the greenhouse soil remediation group agent passes through as follows
Preparation method obtains： 
 （1）Inoculation：Prepare geotrichum candidum（Geotrichum Candidum）XHS0030B CGMCC NO.9435, marsh are red false single
Born of the same parents bacterium, four kinds of strains of candida utili and Mortierella alpina solid medium, sterile working is strictly carried out after sterilizing, from oblique
Face is forwarded to plate, cultivates 3 days at 28 DEG C of temperature； 
 （2）Level-one culture：From step（1）In solid medium on picking single colonie be forwarded to the 50mL equipped with fluid nutrient medium
In conical flask, sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min culture -48h for 24 hours； 
 （3）Second order fermentation：By above-mentioned steps（2）In level-one culture strain be inoculated in the 500mL taper for filling fluid nutrient medium
In bottle, sterile working, 28 DEG C, 120r/min culture 36h -72h； 
 （4）The compatibility of strain fermentating liquid：With weight ratio meter, optional step（3）70 part -80 of the geotrichum candidum second order fermentation liquid of preparation
Part, 30 parts -50 parts of Rhodopseudomonas palustris second order fermentation liquid, 20 parts -40 parts of candida utili second order fermentation liquid and high mountain quilt
10 parts -30 parts of the mould second order fermentation liquid of spore is mixed, and the mixed liquor of composite bacteria is prepared； 
 （5）Add auxiliary material：By step（4）The composite bacteria mixed liquor of preparation is sufficiently adsorbed in carrier, and carrier selects greenhouse big
Canopy soil；Auxiliary material uses urea and calcium superphosphate, and wherein the weight ratio of urea and calcium superphosphate is 1:2.5；Carrier and auxiliary material
Dosage is 1 according to weight ratio:3 proportion mixing, add water to water content 40-70%, then by volume every cubic metre of carrier with it is auxiliary
Above-mentioned steps are added in material mixing materials（4）The composite bacteria mixed liquor 100-300g of preparation, and be uniformly mixed, prepare greenhouse
Plastic shed soil reparation group agent. 
 
     
 
   
 
 5. the application method of greenhouse soil remediation group agent as claimed in claim 4, which is characterized in that the application method
Steps are as follows： 
 By the greenhouse soil remediation group agent of preparation at 20-40 DEG C of air themperature composting；Composting be in the case where covering straw screen or mat into
Row, it is primary that composting starts rear every turning in 30 days, and to water content 40-70%, the composting time continues 120 days for moisturizing when turning；Composting is complete
At soil can be directly applied to after rear airing to drying. 
 
     
 
   
 
 6. application of the greenhouse soil remediation group agent as claimed in claim 4 in greenhouse soil remediation.
