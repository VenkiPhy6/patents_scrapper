   6 . The seed of  claim 1 , further comprising a transgene, wherein said transgene is introduced by backcrossing or genetic transformation into said variety CV399111, said variety CV644326, or both varieties CV399111 and CV644326. 
 
     
   7 . The seed of  claim 6 , wherein the transgene confers a trait selected from the group consisting of male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, disease resistance, waxy starch, modified fatty acid metabolism, modified phytic acid metabolism, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism. 
 
     
   8 . A method of producing the seed of  claim 1 , the method comprising crossing a plant of variety CV399111 with a plant of variety CV644326. 
 
     
   9 . A seed of hybrid corn variety CH011011 further comprising a single locus conversion, wherein a plant grown from said seed comprises a trait conferred by said single locus conversion and otherwise comprises all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of hybrid corn variety CH011011, and wherein said seed is produced by crossing a first plant selected from the group consisting of variety CV399111 and selfed progeny thereof with a second plant selected from a second group consisting of variety CV644326 and selfed progeny thereof, wherein said first plant, said second plant, or both further comprise said single locus conversion, and wherein representative seeds of said varieties CV399111 and CV644326 are deposited under NCMA Accession No. 202106012 and ATCC Accession No. PTA-125218, respectively. 
 
     
   10 . The seed of  claim 9 , wherein said single locus conversion confers a trait selected from the group consisting of male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, disease resistance, waxy starch, modified fatty acid metabolism, modified phytic acid metabolism, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism. 
 
     
   11 . A plant grown from the seed of  claim 9 , wherein said plant comprises said trait and otherwise comprises all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of hybrid corn variety CH011011. 
 
     
   12 . A method of introducing a heritable trait into hybrid corn variety CH011011, the method comprising the steps of:
 (a) introducing at least said heritable trait into a first inbred corn variety CV399111, a second inbred corn variety CV644326, or both inbred corn varieties CV399111 and CV644326 to produce plants of said inbred corn varieties that heritably carry said heritable trait, wherein said heritable trait is introduced into said inbred corn varieties by backcrossing, wherein said backcrossing is sufficient to produce an inbred corn variety further comprising said heritable trait, and wherein representative seeds of said inbred corn varieties CV399111 and CV644326 are deposited under NCMA Accession No. 202106012 and ATCC Accession No. PTA-125218, respectively; and   (b) producing a plant of hybrid corn variety CH011011 further comprising said heritable trait by crossing a plant of said first or said second inbred corn variety that heritably carries said heritable trait with a plant of a different inbred corn variety selected from a group consisting of inbred corn varieties CV399111 and CV644326, or crossing a plant of said first inbred corn variety and a plant of said second inbred corn variety that both heritably carry said heritable trait.   
 
     
   13 . The method of  claim 12  wherein said heritable trait is selected from the group consisting of male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, disease resistance, waxy starch, modified fatty acid metabolism, modified phytic acid metabolism, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism. 
 
     
   14 . The method of  claim 12  further comprising repeating step (a) at least once to introduce at least a second heritable trait into hybrid corn variety CH011011, wherein the second heritable trait is selected from the group consisting of male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, disease resistance, waxy starch, modified fatty acid metabolism, modified phytic acid metabolism, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism. 
 
     
   15 . A plant produced by the method of  claim 12 , wherein said plant comprises said heritable trait and otherwise comprises all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of corn variety CH011011 when grown under the same environmental conditions. 
 
     
   16 . A method of producing a progeny corn plant derived from hybrid corn variety CH011011, wherein the method comprises applying plant breeding techniques to the plant of  claim 2  to produce said progeny corn plant derived from hybrid corn variety CH011011. 
 
     
   17 . The method of  claim 16 , wherein said plant breeding techniques comprise backcrossing, marker assisted breeding, pedigree breeding, selfing, outcrossing, haploid production, doubled haploid production, or transformation. 
 
     
   18 . The method of  claim 16 , further comprising the steps of:
 (a) crossing said progeny corn plant derived from hybrid corn variety CH011011 with itself or a second plant to produce a seed of a progeny plant of a subsequent generation;   (b) growing the progeny plant of the subsequent generation from said seed of the progeny plant of the subsequent generation; and   (c) repeating steps (a) and (b) for at least an additional 3-10 generations to produce a progeny corn plant further derived from the hybrid corn variety CH011011.   
 
     
   19 . A method of producing a commodity plant product, the method comprising obtaining the plant of  claim 2  or a part thereof and producing said commodity plant product therefrom wherein said plant part comprises a cell of hybrid corn variety CH011011. 
 
     
   20 . The method of  claim 19 , wherein said commodity plant product is grain, starch, seed oil, corn syrup, or protein.
