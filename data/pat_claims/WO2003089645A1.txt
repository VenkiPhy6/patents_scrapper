 1. A human tumor suppressor protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. 
 
 
 2. A human tumor suppressor gene encoding the human tumor suppressor protein of claim 1. 
 
 
 3. The tumor suppressor gene of claim 2 having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. 
 
 
 4. The tumor suppressor gene of claim 2 having the nucleotide sequence corresponding to base Nos. 170-1,108 of SEQ ID NO: 1. 
 
 
 5. An expression vector comprising the tumor suppressor gene of claim 3. 
 
 
 6. The expression vector of claim 5, which is vector HCCS-4/pCEV-LAC. 
 
 
 7. A cell transformed with the expression vector of claim 5, the cell being a microorganism or animal cell. 
 
 
 8. The cell of claim 1, which is Escherichia coli DH5Î±/HCCS5/pCEN- LAC (KCTC 10178BP). 
 
 
 9. A method for suppressing proliferation of cancer cells which comprises introducing the expression vector of claim 5 into a cancer cell to induce apoptosis thereof. 
 
 
 10. A composition for preventing or treating cancer which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of the tumor suppressor gene of any one of claims 2 to 4 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
