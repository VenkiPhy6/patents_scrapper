 1. A fusion protein consisting of human epidermal growth factor, a linker composed of 0 to 20 amino acids, and human angiogenin in a sequential order. 
 
     
 2. The fusion protein of  claim 1 , wherein the human epidermal growth factor and the human angiogenin are fused in a molecular ratio of 1:0.5-2. 
 
     
 3. The fusion protein of  claim 1 , wherein the linker is selected from the group consisting of glycine, (glycine) 4 serine, and [(glycine) 4 serine] 2 . 
 
     
 4. A nucleic acid molecule encoding the fusion protein of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 5. An expression vector containing the nucleic acid molecule of  claim 4 . 
 
     
 6. A microorganism transformed by the expression vector of  claim 5 . 
 
     
 7. A process for preparing a fusion protein comprising the steps of: inducing expression of the fusion protein from the microorganism of  claim 6  and obtaining the recombinant fusion protein. 
 
     
 8. A fusion protein produced by the process of  claim 7 . 
 
     
 9. An anticancer agent comprising the fusion protein of  claim 1  as an active ingredient and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. 
 
     
 10. A fusion protein consisting of human epidermal growth factor, a linker of [(glycine) 4 serine] 2  and human angiogenin, which is represented as SEQ ID No: 22. 
 
     
 11. A nucleic acid molecule encoding the fusion protein of  claim 10 , which is represented as SEQ ID No: 24. 
 
     
 12. An expression vector pTE40810 containing the nucleic acid molecule of  claim 11 .
