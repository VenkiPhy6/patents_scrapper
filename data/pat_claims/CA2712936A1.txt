 4. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said PAD  measurement is increased by less than 10% after storage for at least 4 months compared to the PAD measurement at harvest.  
 
     
 5. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said SSC is reduced by less than 2% after storage for at least 4 months.  
 
     
 6. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims producing bulbs wherein the pungency level of the most pungent bulb and least pungent bulb differ by at most 5 µMol/g FW, preferably by at most 3.5 µMol/g FW.  
 
     
 7. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims producing bulbs wherein all bulbs have a pungency between 0 and 5 µMol/g FW, preferably between 1 and 4 µMol/g FW.  
 
     
 8. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said onion plant requires 14 or more contiguous hours of light for 2 or more days to initiate bulb formation.  
 
     
 9. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said mean PAD or mean SSC is obtained from at least 10 onion bulbs of said plant.  
 
     
 10. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said plant is a hybrid.  
 
     
 11. The onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said plant is derivable from a line designated I37853B, I37554A, or I37554B, deposited under Accession Nos. PTA-9053, PTA-9054 and PTA-9055, respectively.  
 
     
 12. A cell of an onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims.  
 
     
 13. A seed of an onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims, growing into a plant producing bulbs which have a mean PAD measurement at harvest of less than 3.75 µM/g fresh weight (FW) pyruvate.  
 
     
 14. A bulb of an onion plant according to any one of the preceding claims.  
 
     
 15. A container comprising a plurality of bulbs according to claim 14.  
 
     
 16. The container according to claim 15, wherein at least 75% of the bulbs are bulbs according to claim 14.  
 
     
 17. The container according to claim 15 or 16, wherein said container comprises at least 1 pound of bulbs according to claim 14.  
 
     
 18. Part of an onion plant according to any one of claims 1-11, part of a bulb according to claim 14, or part of a seed according to claim 13.  
 
     
 19. The part according to claim 18, wherein said part is a cell or cell culture, a tissue culture, a protoplast, pollen, an ovule, a meristem, an embryo, or a plant organ.  
 
     
 20. The onion plant of any one of claims 1 to 11, or a cell or bulb thereof, wherein said onion plant is a yellow or a Spanish onion.
