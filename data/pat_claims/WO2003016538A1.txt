 1. An expression vector pOmpFβ comprising an ampicillin resistant gene, OmpF promoter and OmpF gene, which is represented as a genetic map of Figure 2. 
 
 
 2. Escherichia coli BL101/pOmpF6 (KCTC 1026BP) transformed with the expression vector pOmpFβ of claim 1. 
 
 
 3. A method for extracellular production of desired protein employing an expression vector pOmpFβ, which comprises the steps of: 
 ( i ) introducing a gene encoding oligopeptide which is recognized and cleaved by a proteolytic enzyme and a gene encoding desired protein into the expression vector pOmpFβ to construct a recombinant expression vector producing the desired protein extracellularly; 
 (ii) transforming a host microorganism lacking OmpF gene with the recombinant expression vector to obtain a transformed microorganism; 
 (iii) culturing the transformed microorganism to produce OmpF-fused protein from the culture; and, 
 (iv) treating the fused protein with a proteolytic enzyme and obtaining the desired protein. 
 
 
 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the proteolytic enzyme is Factor Xa, enterokinase, genenase, IgA protease, intein, thrombin, trypsin, pepsin, subtilisin, or plasmin. 
 
 
 5. The method of claim 3, wherein the desired protein is peptide, enzyme or antibody that can be fused with OmpF. 
 
 
 6. The method of claim 3, wherein the desired protein is β-endorphin. 
 
 
 7. The method of claim 3, wherein the recombinant  expression vector is pOmpFββE. 
 
 
 8. The method of claim 3, wherein the host microorganism is Escherichia sp. or Samonella sp.
