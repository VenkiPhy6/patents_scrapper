 1. A monoclonal antibody against acetylated mouse BubR1 produced by a hybridoma selected from the group consisting of mAcBubR1-SNU-20-4 (KCLRF-BP-00391), mAcBubR1-SNU-20-7 (KCLRF-BP-00392), and mAcBubR1-SNU-20-9 (KCLRF-BP-00393). 
 
     
 2. The monoclonal antibody of  claim 1 , which is produced by mAcBubR1-SNU-20-7 (KCLRF-BP-00392). 
 
     
 3. The monoclonal antibody of  claim 2 , which is specific to endogenous acetylated mouse BubR1. 
 
     
 4. The monoclonal antibody of  claim 1 , which does not exhibit cross-reactivity to a mouse BubR1 protein having non-acetylated 243rd residue lysine and a mouse BubR1 protein having substitution of the 243rd residue lysine with arginine. 
 
     
 5. A hybridoma selected from the group consisting of mAcBubR1-SNU-20-4 (KCLRF-BP-00391), mAcBubR1-SNU-20-7 (KCLRF-BP-00392), and mAcBubR1-SNU-20-9 (KCLRF-BP-00393), which produces a monoclonal antibody against acetylated mouse BubR1. 
 
     
 6. A method of detecting acetylation degree of BubR1 protein, comprising determining the acetylation degree of the BubR1 protein using the monoclonal antibody of  claim 1 . 
 
     
 7. The method of  claim 6 , wherein the monoclonal antibody is produced by mAcBubR1-SNU-20-7 (KCLRF-BP-00392). 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 7 , wherein the acetylation degree is that of endogenous acetylated mouse BubR1.
