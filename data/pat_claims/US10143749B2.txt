 (ii) a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 114, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20, or SEQ ID NO: 21. 
 
 
     
 4. The anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody according to  claim 1 , wherein the anti-c-Met antibody comprises:
 (i) a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 62, the amino acid sequence from positions 18 to 462 of SEQ ID NO: 62, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 64, the amino acid sequence from positions 18 to 461 of SEQ ID NO: 64, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 66, or the amino acid sequence from positions 18 to 460 of SEQ ID NO: 66; and 
 (ii) a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68, the amino acid sequence from positions 21 to 240 of SEQ ID NO: 68, the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70, the amino acid sequence from positions 21 to 240 of SEQ ID NO: 70. 
 
 
     
 5. The anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody according to  claim 1 , wherein the anti-c-Met antibody comprises a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 66 or the amino acid sequence from positions 18 to 460 of SEQ ID NO: 66, and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 68 or the amino acid sequence from positions 21 to 240 of SEQ ID NO: 68. 
 
     
 6. The anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody according to  claim 1 , wherein the anti-Her2 antigen binding fragment is an antigen binding fragment from Trastuzumab or Pertuzumab. 
 
     
 7. The anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody according to  claim 1 , wherein the antigen-binding fragment of the anti-Her2 antibody is covalently linked to the C-terminus of the anti-c-Met antibody. 
 
     
 8. The anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody according to  claim 7 , wherein the antigen-binding fragment of the anti-Her2 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 109 and a light chain variable region comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 111. 
 
     
 9. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody according to  claim 1  and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. 
 
     
 10. A method of treatment of a cancer, comprising administering the anti-c-Met/anti-Her2 bispecific antibody of  claim 1  to a patient in need thereof.
