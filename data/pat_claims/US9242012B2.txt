 1. A method of treating a subject having progressive, castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed after prior taxane therapy, the method comprising:
 selecting a subject having progressive, castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed after prior taxane therapy, and 
 administering an effective amount of a prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody drug conjugate (PSMA ADC) to the subject, wherein the PSMA ADC comprises a human monoclonal antibody to PSMA conjugated to monomethylauristatin norephedrine (MMAE) or monomethylauristatin phenylalanine (MMAF), and wherein the effective amount is sufficient to 1) delay or inhibit progression of the cancer, 2) increase survival of the subject as compared to the median survival of subjects who have not been treated with the PSMA ADC and who have progressive, castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed after prior taxane therapy, 3) decrease a circulating level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) compared to a baseline level, or 4) decrease or stabilize a serum level of PSA compared to a baseline level of PSA. 
 
 
     
 2. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the effective amount is sufficient to delay or inhibit progression of the cancer. 
 
     
 3. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the effective amount is sufficient to increase survival of the subject as compared to the median survival of subjects who have not been treated with the PSMA ADC and who have progressive, castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer that has progressed after prior taxane therapy. 
 
     
 4. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the effective amount is sufficient to decrease the circulating level of CTCs as compared to the baseline level. 
 
     
 5. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the effective amount is sufficient to decrease or stabilize the serum level of PSA compared to the baseline level of PSA. 
 
     
 6. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the human antibody to PSMA is conjugated to MMAE or MMAF via a valine-citrulline linker. 
 
     
 7. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the taxane is docetaxel. 
 
     
 8. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the taxane is paclitaxel. 
 
     
 9. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the human antibody is an IgG1 comprising (a) a heavy chain encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising the coding region or regions of a nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, and (b) a light chain encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising the coding region or regions of a nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 8. 
 
     
 10. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the delay or inhibition of progression of the cancer is demonstrated by radiographic image changes in tumor burden compared to a baseline radiographic image in the subject prior to the administration of the PSMA ADC. 
 
     
 11. The method of  claim 10 , wherein the radiographic image change is a change of at least 10%. 
 
     
 12. The method of  claim 11 , wherein the radiographic image change is a change of at least 20%. 
 
     
 13. The method of  claim 12 , wherein the radiographic image change is a change of at least 30%. 
 
     
 14. The method of  claim 13 , wherein the radiographic image change is a change of at least 40%. 
 
     
 15. The method of  claim 14 , wherein the radiographic image change is a change of at least 50%. 
 
     
 16. The method of  claim 15 , wherein the radiographic image change is a change of at least 60%. 
 
     
 17. The method of  claim 1 , wherein the effective amount of the PSMA ADC is a dose of 0.1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg. 
 
     
 18. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the effective amount of the PSMA ADC is a dose of 0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 0.7 mg/kg, 0.9 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 1.6 mg/kg, 1.8 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 2.4 mg/kg or 2.9 mg/kg. 
 
     
 19. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered a total of 4 doses. 
 
     
 20. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered a total of 12 doses. 
 
     
 21. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered a total of 17 doses. 
 
     
 22. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered a total of 18 doses. 
 
     
 23. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the dose is administered at 1, 2, 3 or 4 week intervals. 
 
     
 24. The method of  claim 23 , wherein the dose is administered at 3 week intervals. 
 
     
 25. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered the dose of PSMA ADC once every week for the first three weeks of a four week cycle for a total of 4 cycles. 
 
     
 26. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered 4 doses at 3-week intervals. 
 
     
 27. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered 5 doses at 3-week intervals. 
 
     
 28. The method of  claim 26 , wherein the subject is administered an additional 13 doses at 3-week intervals. 
 
     
 29. The method of  claim 27 , wherein the subject is administered an additional 13 doses at 3-week intervals. 
 
     
 30. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered the PSMA ADC with a dose regimen of q4d×3. 
 
     
 31. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the subject is administered the PSMA ADC with a dose regimen of q4d×6. 
 
     
 32. The method of  claim 17 , wherein the dose is administered intravenously.
