 2. the polynucleotide of the polypeptide described in the coding claim 1 represented by SEQ ID NO.2 are for the production of the purposes of L-Orn or L-arginine. 
 
     
 3. for the production of L-Orn or L-arginine coryneform bacteria (
           corynebacterium sp. ) bacterial strain is for the production of the purposes of L-Orn or L-arginine, described corynebacterium strain transforms with the recombinant vectors of the expression for increasing polynucleotide thus strengthens the activity of acetylglutamate synthase and acetyl-ornithinase relative to intrinsic activity, wherein, described polynucleotide are represented by SEQ ID NO.2.
         
 
     
 
   
 
 4. purposes according to claim 3, wherein, described bacterial strain is corynebacterium glutamicum. 
 
     
 5., for the production of a method for L-Orn or L-arginine, comprising: 
 Cultivate corynebacterium strain according to claim 3 in the medium; And 
 L-Orn or L-arginine is reclaimed from culture.
