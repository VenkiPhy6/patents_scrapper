 1. A dough for baking comprising water, flour and an isolated yeast stain of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  SPC-SNU 70-1 (KCTC 12776BP), wherein the isolated  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is a solely added microorganism, and the dough is obtained by mixing the flour and water, and fermenting the mixture with the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.    
 
     
 2. A dough for baking comprising water, flour, an isolated yeast stain of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  SPC-SNU 70-1 (KCTC 12776BP), and one or more  Lactobacillus  strains selected from the group consisting of  Lactobacillus curvatus  SPC-SNU 70-3 (KCTC 12778BP),  Lactobacillus brevis  SPC-SNU 70-2 (KCTC 12777BP),  Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis  SPC-SNU 70-4 (KCTC 12779BP) and combinations thereof, wherein the isolated  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is a solely added yeast, and the dough is obtained by mixing the flour and water, and fermenting the mixture with the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and the one or more  Lactobacillus  strains. 
 
     
 3. A bread produced by baking the dough of  claim 1 , wherein the bread contains greater amount of ketone with less amount of ethyl alcohol compared to a commercial yeast-applied bread, thereby has soft and mild flavor and taste, as well as fresh aroma. 
 
     
 4. A bread produced by baking the dough of  claim 2 .
