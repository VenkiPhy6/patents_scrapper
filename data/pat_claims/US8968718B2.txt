 1. An enviromental friendly carrier material comprising a bacterial mixture capable of accelerated biological degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in a sea ice-covered polar region, the bacterial mixture comprising a plurality of isolated different cold-adapted autochthonous bacterial strains each having petroleum hydrocarbons degrading activity at an ambient temperature of −3° C. and each having a different temperature tolerance range, a different salinity tolerance range, a different petroleum hydrocarbons degradation spectrum, and a different capacity to emulsify oil, wherein the bacterial mixture is immobilized on the carrier material, and wherein bacterial the bacterial mixture comprises at least one isolated bacterial strain selected from the group consisting of  Rhodococcus  GH-t deposited with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Depository in Braunschweig, Germany (DSMZ) and assigned accession number DSM 18943;  Dietzia  GH-2 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18944;  Shewanella  GH-4 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18946;  Marinobacter  GH-9 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18951;  Pseudomonas  GH-10 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18952;  Oleispira  GH-11 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18953. 
 
     
 2. The carrier material having the bacterial mixture according to  claim 1 , wherein bacterial strains comprise dominant bacterial strains that are isolated after enrichment in a laboratory mesocosm setup over a period of 12 to 36 months, the mesocosm being prepared with sea ice from a current or potential contamination site, artificially contaminated with crude oil, supplied with nutrients, and incubated at −3° C. 
 
     
 3. The carrier material according to  claim 1 , wherein the bacterial mixture further comprises at least one isolated additional bacterial strain to broaden an overall degradation spectrum and enhance an overall oil emulsifying capacity, the at least one additional bacterial strain being selected from the group consisting of:  Marinobacter  GH-3 deposited with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Depository in Braunschweig. Germany (DSMZ) and assigned accession number DSM 18945;  Marinomonas GH- 5 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18947;  Pseudoalteromonas  GH-6 deposited with the DSMZ and assined accession number DSM 18948;  Psychrobacter  GH-7 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18949; and  Jannaschia  GH-8 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18950. 
 
     
 4. An enviromental friendly carrier material comprising a bacterial mixture capable of accelerated biological degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in a sea ice-covered polar region at an ambient temperature of −3° C., the bacterial mixture being obtained by isolating dominant bacterial strains that are enriched in a laboratory mesocosm setup over a period of 12 to 36 months, the mesocosm being prepared with sea ice from a current or potential contamination site, artificially contaminated with crude oil, supplied with nutrients, and incubated at −3° C., wherein the bacterial mixture immobilized on the carrier material. 
 
     
 5. An enviromental friendly carrier material comprising a bacterial mixture capable of accelerated biological degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in a sea ice-covered polar region, the bacterial mixture comprising a plurality of isolated different cold-adapted autochthonous bacterial strains each having petroleum hydrocarbons degrading activity at an ambient temperature of −3° C., and each having a different temperature tolerance range, a different salinity tolerance range, a different petroleum hydrocarbons degradation spectrum, and a different capacity to emulsify oil, wherein the bacterial mixture immobilized on the carrier material, and wherein the bacterial mixture comprises each of: Rhodococcus GH-t deposited with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Depository in Braunschweig, Germany (DSMZ) and assigned accession number DSM 18943;  Dietzia  GH-2 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18944;  Shewanella  GH-4 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18946;  Marinobacter  GH-9 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18951;  Pseudomonas  GH-10 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18952;  Oleispira  GH-11 deposited with the DSMZ and assigned accession number DSM 18953.
