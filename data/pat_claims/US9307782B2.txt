 1. A method for producing a mannanase comprising the following steps:
 1) culturing  Celluosimicrobium  sp. strain HY-13 deposited under the Accession Number of KCTC 11302BP in a medium containing mannan, and obtaining supernatant by centrifuging thereof; 
 2) inducing precipitation of water-soluble proteins by adding a precipitant to the supernatant of step 1); 
 3) obtaining a crude enzyme solution by dialyzing the precipitate of step 2) after eliminating insoluble precipitate from the same; and 
 4) purifying the mannanase from the crude enzyme solution of step 3). 
 
 
     
 2. An animal feed comprising grains, plants, and mannan and further comprising the mannanase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 at a concentration of from 0.05 to about 5 weight part. 
 
     
 3. The animal feed of  claim 2  which is a non-ruminant feed.
