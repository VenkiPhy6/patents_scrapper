     This invention provides a polypeptide useful in the field of medicines, a DNA which encodes the novel polypeptide, a recombinant DNA molecule which contains the DNA, a transformant transformed with the DNA or the recombinant DNA molecule, a process for the purification of the polypeptide, a process for the production of the polypeptide, an antibody which recognizes the polypeptide, an oligonucleotide complementary to the DNA and a screening method. Particularly this invention provides a polypeptide, which is Fas ligand or a fragment thereof. This polypeptide can be used as an effective ingredient of a medicament for regulating the apoptosis in a living body. This polypeptide is obtained by identifying a DNA fragment, which encodes the polypeptide, transforming a desired host with a recombinant DNA molecule, which contains the DNA fragment, and purifying the polypeptide produced by the resulting transformant. This polypeptide has a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain and extracellular domain and takes part in apoptosis.

    <div num="p-0001" class="abstract style-scope patent-text">This invention provides a polypeptide useful in the field of medicines, a DNA which encodes the novel polypeptide, a recombinant DNA molecule which contains the DNA, a transformant transformed with the DNA or the recombinant DNA molecule, a process for the purification of the polypeptide, a process for the production of the polypeptide, an antibody which recognizes the polypeptide, an oligonucleotide complementary to the DNA and a screening method. Particularly this invention provides a polypeptide, which is Fas ligand or a fragment thereof. This polypeptide can be used as an effective ingredient of a medicament for regulating the apoptosis in a living body. This polypeptide is obtained by identifying a DNA fragment, which encodes the polypeptide, transforming a desired host with a recombinant DNA molecule, which contains the DNA fragment, and purifying the polypeptide produced by the resulting transformant. This polypeptide has a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain and extracellular domain and takes part in apoptosis.</div>

    <heading class="style-scope patent-text">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <div num="p-0004" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Based on the morphology of dying cells, Cell death is generally divided into two categories, necrosis and apoptosis. In the necrotic cell death, degradation of cell membrane and release of cellular contents into extracellular matrix are observed. On the other hand, in the apoptotic cell death, fragmentation of chromosomal DNA and concentration of nuclei are observed while the degradation of the cell membrane and the release of the cellular contents as observed in the necrosis are not observed. Apoptosis has been conceived to be a form of programmed cell death. For example, phenomena of deletion of unnecessary cells and organs in the course of ontogenesis are considered to be caused by the apoptosis of cells. Another phenomenon that is considered to be the apoptosis is the cell death which occurs when virus-infected cells and tumor cells are attacked and removed by cytotoxic T cells (CTL), natural killer cells (NK cells), TNF-α, TNF-β and the like. As described above, apoptosis is one of the physiological phenomena which have recently attracted special attention, and studies are being conducted by many researchers with the aim of elucidating the function of the apoptosis as well as its physiological meaning and relation to diseases.</div>
    <div num="p-0005" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Fas antibody has been known as a substance which can induce the apoptosis of cells. Fas antibody is a monoclonal antibody obtained by immunizing a mouse with human fibloblast (Yonehara S. et al., <i class="style-scope patent-text">J. Exp. Med</i>., vol. 169, pp. 1747-1756, 1989). Since Fas antibody has been obtained by the immunization of a mouse with cells, the type of molecules recognized by Fas antibody and the transfer mechanism of apoptosis signal to the cells were not revealed for a long time. Recently, however, Itoh N. et al. have succeeded in cloning the gene of the molecule (Fas antigen) which is specifically recognized by the Fas antibody (<i class="style-scope patent-text">Cell</i>, vol. 66, pp. 233-243, 1991). It was then found that the Fas antigen is a cell membrane protein having a size of about 45 kD, and its amino acid sequence analysis has revealed that the Fas antigen belongs to the family of TNF receptors. In addition, a mouse Fas antigen gene was cloned (Watanabe-Fukunaga R. et al., <i class="style-scope patent-text">J. Immunol</i>., vol. 148, pp. 1274-1279, 1992), and the mRNA for Fas antigen was confirmed to be expressed in thymus, liver, lung, heart and ovary of the mouse.</div>
    <div num="p-0006" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">After the cloning of the Fas antigen gene, a number of studies have been conducted and reported on the relationship between the apoptosis mediated by Fas antigen and various diseases.</div>
    <div num="p-0007" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Kobayashi N. et al. have reported that expression of Fas antigen on T cell membrane is induced upon infection with AIDS virus, suggesting a possibility that the apoptosis of T cells found in AIDS is a Fas antigen-mediated phenomenon (<i class="style-scope patent-text">Nikkei Science</i>, vol. 6, pp. 34-41, 1993).</div>
    <div num="p-0008" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Ogasawara J. et al. have observed that a phenomenon similar to fulminant hepatitis occurs upon administration of Fas antibody to a mouse, and suggested a possibility of the occurrence of a Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis in the inflammatory lesion of the fulminant hepatitis or the like (<i class="style-scope patent-text">Nature</i>, vol. 364, pp. 806-809, 1993). Hiramatsu N. et al. have reported that, in a patient suffering chronic type C hepatitis, Fas antigen is frequently expressed in the inflammatory lesion of the liver where leukocyte infiltration is observed (Hepatology, vol. 19, pp. 1354-1359, 1994).</div>
    <div num="p-0009" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In addition, Watanabe-Fukunaga R. et al. have confirmed that a mutation in the Fas antigen gene is present in the lpr mouse, which is one of autoimmune disease model animals and that the cells expressing such mutation in the Fas antigen gene do not undergo the apoptosis (<i class="style-scope patent-text">Nature</i>, vol. 356, pp. 314-317, 1992). Watanabe-Fukunaga R. et al. have estimated that autoimmune disease-like symptoms are generated by the autoreactive T cells remaining in the body, that should have been removed from the body through the apoptosis.</div>
    <div num="p-0010" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As described above, a number of studies have been reported on the relation between the Fas antigen and diseases. An unsolved question is whether or not there is a molecule (Fas ligand) that binds to the Fas antigen on the cell surface to induce the cell apoptosis, namely, a molecule that acts in a manner similar to the above described Fas antibody.</div>
    <div num="p-0011" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Watanabe-Fukunaga R. et al. have presumed that, in a gld mouse which exhibits autoimmune disease-like symptoms, an abnormality should be present in a biological molecule which binds to Fas antigen, as in the case of the lpr mouse.</div>
    <div num="p-0012" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In addition, Rouvier E. et al. have reported that a certain type of T cells show a specific cytotoxic action on the cells expressing Fas antigen (<i class="style-scope patent-text">J. Exp. Med</i>., vol. 177, pp. 195-200, 1993). More illustrating, they have shown that a Ca<sup class="style-scope patent-text">2+</sup>-independent cytotoxic action by mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and PC60-d10S cells, the latter being a hybridoma of mouse CTL and rat T-lymphoma cells, is observed only for the Fas antigen-expressing cells. They have also suggested the possibility that such lymphocytes, especially T cells, could recognize the Fas antigen or certain Fas antigen-related molecules, and the possibility that these cells might express to Fas ligand.</div>
    <div num="p-0013" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Though the possibility of the presence of a Fas ligand has been suggested by the researchers as described above, its specific nature is not yet revealed.</div>
    <div num="p-0014" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">It is important to isolate the Fas ligand in order to elucidate mechanism of the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis and reveal relationship between the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis and diseases more clearly. In consequence, confirmation of the presence of the Fas ligand and revelation of its true nature have been called for in various fields including the medicine.</div>
    <div num="p-0015" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">A primary object of the present invention is to provide the field of medical care with a Fas ligand and its gene and a means for artificially regulating apoptosis generated in the body.</div>
    <div num="p-0016" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As described in the foregoing, the diseases considered to be related to the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis include those which are caused by the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis, and, those which are caused by the absence of the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis. For example, it is estimated that death of hepatocytes and the subsequent reduction in the liver function in the case of hepatitis and decrease in the number of HIV-infected T cells and the subsequent reduction in the immunological function in the case of AIDS would be improved by inhibiting the apoptosis. In the case of certain autoimmune diseases, on the other hand, the symptoms are estimated to be improved by allowing the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis to occur normally and by enhancing the removal of autoantigen reactive T cells. With regard to the treatment of AIDS in its early stage, induction of the apoptosis of the cells infected with HIV and their removal from the body would be effective. Morimoto H. et al. have reported that the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis induced in cancer cells could synergistically enhance carcinostatic effects of adriamycin and cisplatin (Cancer Res., vol. 53, pp. 2591-2596, 1993). A substance capable of binding to Fas antigen to induce apoptosis should be useful in the treatment of cancers.</div>
    <div num="p-0017" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Such a treatment which is based on the principle of artificially regulating the Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis can be established only after the identification of the Fas ligand. In other words, artificial enhancement of the apoptosis in the living body would be enabled when the Fas ligand is specified.</div>
    <div num="p-0018" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In order to use the Fas ligand or a part of the ligand in medical treatments and researches, it would be necessary to produce the Fas ligand protein in a large scale and at a high purity. Cloning of the gene coding for such protein will enable the production of the protein by means of genetic engineering techniques, and the thus produced protein can be used for the main effective component in therapeutic drugs and in the production of antibodies. In addition, the gene itself could be used in gene therapy and development of antisense drugs, as well as for the preparation of model animals, such as transgenic mice, of apoptosis-related diseases.</div>
    <heading class="style-scope patent-text">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <div num="p-0019" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies with the aim of isolating Fas ligand, taking note of the aforementioned PC60-d10S cells. PC60-d10S is a hybridoma of mouse CTL and rat T-lymphoma, which induces apoptosis only in Fas antigen-expressing cells when stimulated with PMA (phorbol myristate acetate) and ionomycin. As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have succeeded in obtaining a cell population, PC60-d10S-2, which shows higher cytotoxicity without stimulation and is useful for the cloning of the Fas ligand gene. Thereafter, the rat Fas ligand gene was cloned making use of this cell population. Also, the present inventors have conducted intensive studies with the aim of isolating a human Fas ligand suitable for use in pharmaceutical drugs and the like and succeeded in obtaining a gene which encodes human Fas ligand, as well as a gene which encodes mouse Fas ligand. It was confirmed thereafter that these genes have similar sequences having a common partial sequence. The inventors of the present invention have also identified the part of the sequence that should be necessary in exhibiting Fas ligand function.

    <heading class="style-scope patent-text">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <div num="p-0073" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The present invention is hereinafter described in further detail.</div>
    <div num="p-0074" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">First, the polypeptide according the first aspect of the present invention is described.</div>
    <div num="p-0075" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In the description of the present invention, the term, “polypeptide containing (or including) the amino acid sequence of or SEQ ID NO: X” designates the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence defined in or SEQ ID NO: X wherein one or more amino acid residues are optionally added on either one or both of its N terminus and C terminus.</div>
    <div num="p-0076" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The term, “polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of or SEQ ID NO: X” designates the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence defined in or SEQ ID NO: X.</div>
    <div num="p-0077" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The term, “Fas ligand” designates a substance provided with an activity to induce apoptosis of a Fas antigen-expressing cell. Apoptosis of the Fas antigen-expressing cells is estimated to have been induced by the binding of the Fas ligand with the Fas antigen on the cell surface, which results in the transfer of the apoptosis signal to the cell via the Fas antigen.</div>
    <div num="p-0078" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The “Fas antigen” as used herein may be any Fas antigen of animal origin including human Fas antigen, rat Fas antigen and mouse Fas antigen. In this connection, amino acid sequence of human Fas antigen has been determined by Itoh, N. et al., <i class="style-scope patent-text">Cell</i>, vol. 66, pp. 233-243, 1991. Amino acid sequence of mouse Fas antigen has been determined by Watanabe-Fukunaga, R. et al., <i class="style-scope patent-text">J. Immunol</i>., vol. 148, pp. 1274-1279, 1992. Amino acid sequence of rat Fas antigen has been determined by Kimura, K. et al., <i class="style-scope patent-text">Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun</i>., vol. 198, pp. 666-674, 1994.</div>
    <div num="p-0079" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The polypeptides according to the first aspect of the present invention may include any one of the sequences defined in SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22 and 24.</div>
    <div num="p-0080" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The amino acid sequences defined in SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, and 8 are the amino acid sequences of the Fas ligands of human cell origin. The amino acid sequences defined in SEQ ID NOS: 10, 12, 14 and 16 are the amino acid sequences of the Fas ligands of rat cell origin. The amino acid sequences defined in SEQ ID NOS: 18, 20, 22 and 24 are the amino acid sequences of the Fas ligands of mouse cell origin.</div>
    <div num="p-0081" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The amino acid sequences defined in SEQ ID NOS: 8, 16 and 24 includes all the intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular domains, and it is estimated that such polypeptides should exist in organisms as cell surface polypeptides. Therefore, production of polypeptides with such amino acid sequences would require purification of the polypeptides from the cells or tissue expressing such polypeptides.</div>
    <div num="p-0082" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The extracellular domain of a cell surface polypeptide is often cleaved off the cell membrane to be released into the supernatant of the cell culture producing such polypeptide or into body fluids such as urine and blood. In general, purification of a polypeptide is more efficient and productive when the polypeptide is purified from a supernatant or urine compared to the purification from cells or a tissue. The situation is the same for the Fas ligand, and purification of the extracellular domain of the Fas ligand is more productive than the purification of the entire Fas ligand.</div>
    <div num="p-0083" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In the present invention, there is also provided polypeptides corresponding to such extracellular domain of the Fas ligands. The cleavage site of the Fas ligand at which the extracellular domain is separated from the cell membrane is not limited to any particular site, and the cleavage site may vary according to the conditions of the cell culture or proteases present inside or outside the cell. Preferably, the extracellular domains of the Fas ligands are polypeptides having the amino acid sequences defined in SEQ ID NOS: 6, 14, and 22, which correspond to the extracellular domains of the human, rat, and mouse Fas ligands, respectively. The amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 corresponds to the sequence of from 103rd amino acid residue to 281st amino acid residue from the N terminus in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8. The amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14 corresponds to the sequence of from 100th amino acid residue to 278th amino acid residue from the N terminus in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16. The amino acid sequence of SEQ ID-NO: 22 corresponds to the sequence of from 101st amino acid residue to 279th amino acid residue from the N terminus in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14.</div>
    <div num="p-0084" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As is known in the art, in producing polypeptides by recombinant DNA technology, amount of the polypeptide expressed, and hence, production efficiency would be higher when the polypeptide produced has a lower molecular weight. In addition, a polypeptide solely comprising the part required for its action would have an antigenicity lower than the polypeptides including additional sequences. Furthermore, if the polypeptide of interest has a low molecular weight, it would be possible to fuse the polypeptide with another polypeptide having another activity to provide the polypeptide with another activity, or to bind the polypeptide with an antibody to specify the target cell to which the polypeptide exerts its activity. In the present invention, there is provided polypeptides having the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NOS: 2, 10 and 18 which have lower molecular weight, therefore, higher productivity and lower antigenicity are expected. There is also provided in the present invention polypeptides having the amino acid sequences defined by SEQ ID NOS: 4, 12, and 20.</div>
    <div num="p-0085" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 10, 12, 18 and 20, respectively represent parts of the amino acid sequences of the extracellular domain of the human, rat and mouse Fas ligands.</div>
    <div num="p-0086" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">More illustratively, the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 10 and 18 respectively represent the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 6, 14 and 22 wherein 42 amino acid residues on their N terminus are missing; and the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 4, 12 and 20 respectively represent the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 6, 14 and 22 wherein 41 amino acid residues on their N terminus are missing. As demonstrated in the Examples, the polypeptides (of SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 4) having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6 wherein 42 or 41 amino acid residues on the N terminus are missing still have the apoptosis-inducing activity. The polypeptides having the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6 wherein 40, 38 or 34 amino acid residues on the N terminus are missing also have the apoptosis-inducing activity.</div>
    <div num="p-0087" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">It was then indicated that the amino acid sequence in the downstream from the 43rd amino acid residue should be critical for the apoptosis-inducing activity, and a polypeptide including such critical sequence as defined by SEQ ID NO: 2, 10 or 18 as a part of its sequence would have the apoptosis-inducing activity. Accordingly, the polypeptides of the present invention may be characterized by the inclusion of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 2, 10 or 18.</div>
    <div num="p-0088" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Of the polypeptides according to the first aspect of the present invention, the polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 corresponding to the extracellular domain of the Fas ligand of human origin wherein amino acid residues of a number selected from 1 to 42 on the N terminus are missing are favorable in view of their lower antigenicity for human in comparison with Fas ligands of animal origin and higher productivity due to the lower molecular weight. Such polypeptides can also be collected from the culture supernatant when they are expressed with a suitable signal peptide by a transformant. In particular, the polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 wherein 40 or 34 amino acid residues on the N terminus are missing is favorable in view of its high activity.</div>
    <div num="p-0089" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In general, depending on the difference in species and individuals, mutation of amino acid sequence sometimes occurs in protein without spoiling its basic function. The term “mutation of amino acid sequence” as used herein means deletion of one or more amino acid residues from an amino acid sequence or their substitution by other amino acid residues and insertion or addition of one or more amino acid residues into or to optional sites of the amino acid sequence. Such a mutation can be introduced artificially by means of genetic engineering techniques.</div>
    <div num="p-0090" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In consequence, polypeptides having other amino acid sequences, for example, having derivatives of any one of the aforementioned amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 in which mutation of amino acid sequence occurred at one or more optional positions, are also included in the polypeptide of the present invention, provided that these polypeptide are possessed of similar properties of the polypeptide of the present invention.</div>
    <div num="p-0091" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In general, DNA molecules which encode polypeptide having the same function show mutual homology and hybridize each other in many cases. Diversity of amino acid sequences also occurs in many cases within such a range that DNA molecules encoding them can be hybridized each other. For example, as will be described later in EXAMPLES, DNA fragments which encode amino acid sequences of the aforementioned SEQ ID NOS: 6 and 22 can hybridize with a DNA fragment which encodes amino acid sequences of the aforementioned SEQ ID NO: 17. In addition, the Fas ligand which contains the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 can bind not only to human Fas antigen but also to mouse Fas antigen. Also, the Fas ligand which contains the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14 can bind not only to rat Fas antigen but also to mouse Fas antigen. The Fas ligand which contains the amino acid sequence of the SEQ ID NO: 22 can bind not only to mouse Fas antigen but also to human Fas antigen. Thus, it is considered that polypeptides having amino acid sequences encoded by mutually hybridizable DNA fragments have substantially the same function. In consequence, the novel polypeptide of the present invention characterized in that it contains an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes with a nucleotide sequence complementary to any one of the nucleotide sequences coding for the aforementioned amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 abd 24, preferably, SEQ ID NO: 2, 10 or 18.</div>
    <div num="p-0092" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In addition to the above mentioned features, the novel polypeptide of the present invention is preferably characterized in that it binds to at least ore selected from the group consisting of human Fas antigens, rat Fas antigens and mouse Fas antigens, and more preferably, it shows an activity to induce apoptosis in Fas antigen-expressing cells.</div>
    <div num="p-0093" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Next, the polypeptide according to the second aspect of the present invention is described.</div>
    <div num="p-0094" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The polypeptide according to the second aspect of the present invention may comprise a fragment of a Fas ligand, or a fusion product of a plurality of the same or different fragments of the Fas ligand. Such polypeptide may preferably have a part of the amino acid sequence defined by any one of SEQ ID NOS: 8, 16 and 24, and such polypeptide may be fused in an arbitrary order to constitute fusion polypeptides.</div>
    <div num="p-0095" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The polypeptide having a part of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NOS: 8, 16 and 24 may have any desired length. The polypeptide, however, may preferably have a length of 5 or more amino acid residues, and more preferably, a length of 10 or more amino acid residues to enable the inclusion the characteristic part of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NOS: 8, 16 and 24.</div>
    <div num="p-0096" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The polypeptide according to the second aspect of the present invention may be either capable or incapable of binding with the Fas antigen. Of the polypeptides according to the second aspect of the present invention, those capable of binding with the Fas antigen, but incapable of inducing the apoptosis, may be used as a substance that competitively acts against the Fas ligand in an organism, and such polypeptides may be administered for the purpose artificially inhibiting the apoptosis. As demonstrated in the Example, the polypeptide according to the second aspect of the present invention may be used as an antigen in producing an antibody against the polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention, irrespective of the presence or the absence of the binding ability with the Fas antigen or the apoptosis-inducing activity.</div>
    <div num="p-0097" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As described above, the polypeptide according to the second aspect of the present invention may comprise a fusion of two or more polypeptides each having the amino acid sequence which is a part of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NOS: 8, 16 and 24, which has been fused in an arbitrary order. Exemplary such fusion polypeptides include, a fusion of two polypeptides each having the amino acid sequence which is a part of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 8; and a fusion of a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence which is a part of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 8 with a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence which is a part of the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 16 or 24. A preferred example are the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of from 50th amino acid residue to 179th amino acid residue from the N terminus in the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 6 fused to the C-terminus of the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of from 1st amino acid residue to 49th amino acid residue from the N terminus in the amino acid sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 14 or 22. Such fusion polypeptides are chimera polypeptides of Fas ligand of human origin with the Fas ligand of rat and mouse origin, respectively. Such fusion polypeptides are expected to have the apoptosis-inducing activity on Fas antigen-expressing cells.</div>
    <div num="p-0098" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The fusion polypeptide as described above may be produced with recombinant DNA technology by ligating the DNAs respectively coding for the polypeptide components to produce a DNA coding for the chimera Fas ligand; introducing the thus produced DNA in a suitable expression vector to transform a suitable host cell; and collecting the chimera Fas ligand of interest from the transformant cells or the culture supernatant.</div>
    <div num="p-0099" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The novel polypeptide according to the first and the second aspect of the present invention may have or may not have sugar chain.</div>
    <div num="p-0100" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Each of the amino acid sequences represented by the aforementioned SEQ ID NOS: 8 and 16 contains 4 sites to which a sugar chain can be added (N-glycosylation sites). That is, amino acid residues of the positions 76 to 78, 184 to 186, 250 to 252 and 260 to 262 in SEQ ID NO: 8 and those of the positions 116 to 118, 130 to 132, 247 to 249 and 257 to 259 in SEQ ID NO: 16 correspond to the N-glycosylation sites. Also, the amino acid sequence of the aforementioned SEQ ID NO: 24 has 5 N-glycosylation sites (amino acid residues of the positions 117 to 119, 131 to 133, 182 to 184, 248 to 250 and 258 to 260).</div>
    <div num="p-0101" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In consequence, addition of sugar chains to such polypeptides may occur when they are produced by animal cells or by means of genetic engineering techniques using eucaryotic cells such as of yeast and animals as the host. On the other hand, the novel polypeptide does not have a sugar chain when produced by means of genetic engineering techniques using procaryotic cells such as of <i class="style-scope patent-text">Escherichia coli </i>as the host.</div>
    <div num="p-0102" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Irrespective of the presence or the absence of additional sugar chains, the polypeptides according to the first and the second aspect of the present invention are useful, and may be used as the antigen in producing the antibody according to the ninth aspect of the present invention, or in screening the substances that would bind to such polypeptides.</div>
    <div num="p-0103" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The novel polypeptide of the first and the second aspects of the present invention may be produced by any method. For example, it may be chemically synthesized using a peptide synthesizer (e.g., Peptide Synthesizer 430A, Perkin-Elmer Japan) or purified from tissues, cells or body fluids of human and any other organism. Examples of the body fluids of human and animals include blood, urine and the like. Useful cells may be selected optionally from those which are capable of producing the novel polypeptide of the present invention. For example, cells capable of expressing the novel polypeptide of the present invention in a high quantity may be selected from splenocytes, thymocytes, lymphocytes and established cell lines thereof, through their analysis by northern blotting, western blotting and the like.</div>
    <div num="p-0104" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">If necessary, production of the polypeptide may be induced by stimulating the cells with one or more appropriate stimulating agent selected from PMA (phorbol myristate acetate), ionomycin, PHA (phytohemagglutinin), ConA (concanavalin A), IL-2 (interleukin-2) and the like. Thereafter, the protein of interest is purified from the cells or a culture supernatant of the cells. Its purification may be carried out through an appropriate combination of usually used polypeptide purification steps such as concentration, various types of chromatography, salting out and the like, making use of the affinity of the polypeptide for Fas antigen or its cytotoxicity on Fas antigenexpressing cells as a marker. A preferred example of the purification method will be described later in relation to the eighth aspect of the present invention.</div>
    <div num="p-0105" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Preferably, however, the novel polypeptide may be produced by means of genetic engineering techniques in the form of a recombinant polypeptide in view of its purity. In order to obtain the novel polypeptide by means of genetic engineering techniques, appropriate host cells are transformed with the novel DNA of the third aspect of the present invention or the recombinant DNA molecule of the fourth aspect of the present invention, both of which will be described later, and the thus obtained transformant is cultured to recover the culture mixture with the transformant from which the polypeptide of interest is subsequently purified. The novel polypeptide may also be produced by another genetic engineering means making use of the novel DNA or the recombinant DNA molecule by employing a cellfree synthesis method (Sambrook J. et al., <i class="style-scope patent-text">Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual </i>2nd. ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1989).</div>

The thus prepared solution is mixed with an activated polyethylene glycol such as methoxypolyethylene glycol succinimidyl succinate to react with each other at room temperature for a certain period of time. Thereafter, a fraction having the activity of the polypeptide is collected by gel filtration or the like means.</div>

In consequence, the novel polypeptide of the first and second aspects of the present invention also include those which received such modifications.</div>
    <div num="p-0110" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">It is generally known that polypeptides often take the form of multimer by covalent bonding or non-covalent bonding in an organism or in a culture medium. Such multimer is formed by the binding of the polypeptides of the same type or different types. For example, TNF has been known to form a trimer, and actibin has been known to form a dimer.</div>
    <div num="p-0111" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The polypeptide according to the first and the second aspect of the present invention may be present either in the form of a monomer or a multimer.

The injection may additionally contain pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as a stabilizer.

Thereafter, a clone capable of producing an antibody which reacts with the antigen is screened from the cDNA library and cultured to obtain a culture supernatant from which the antibody of interest is purified through combination of known purification methods.</div>
    <div num="p-0209" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The novel antibody of the present invention may have an activity to modify the function of the Fas ligand on cells. Among antibodies which have the activity to modify the function of the Fas ligand on cells, most preferred is an antibody which has an activity to inhibit Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. Such an antibody may inhibit the Fas ligand-induced apoptosis completely or partially.</div>
    <div num="p-0210" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In order to obtain an antibody which has the activity to inhibit the Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, sera obtained during the aforementioned polyclonal or monoclonal antibody production process or culture supernatants of the aforementioned hybridoma cells are screened by subjecting them to an assay system such as an in vitro assay system in which Fas ligand or Fas ligand-expressing cells and Fas antigen-expressing cells are used. Thereafter, the antibody of interest is purified from a serum sample or a culture supernatant thus obtained as the result of the screening, through combination of known purification methods.

When a DNA fragment containing introns and exons is transcribed into mRNA, the introns and exons are firstly transcribed as such to form pre-mRNA. Thereafter, portions corresponding to the introns are eliminated by splicing to form mature mRNA in which only the exons are transcribed. The term “mRNA for the Fas ligand” as used herein means both pre-mRNA and mature mRNA.</div>

    <div num="p-0219" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">The term “complementary nucleotide sequence” as used herein means a nucleotide sequence which forms complementary base pairs base-specific for the nucleotide sequence of DNA or mRNA. It is known in general that the complementary base pairs are formed between C (cytosine) and G (guanine), T (thymine) and A (adenine) and U (uracil) and A (adenine). In consequence, a nucleotide sequence complementary to the human Fas ligand gene and nucleotide sequences complementary to the mature mRNAs for human Fas ligand, rat Fas ligand and mouse Fas ligand are respectively obtained by changing A to T, C to G, G to C and T to C, or A to U, C to G, G to C and T to A, of the nucleotide sequences shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS" class="style-scope patent-text">FIGS. 16 to 18</figref> and or the SEQ ID NOS: 35, 25 and 31.

It is considered that an oligonucleotide having a complementary sequence controls expression of protein by exerting an influence upon the normal flow of the transfer of genetic information through its binding to a DNA or mRNA which bears the genetic information, wherein the binding occurs at any one of the steps for the (1) transcription from the gene to pre-mRNA, (2) processing of the pre-mRNA into mature mRNA, (3) passing of the mature mRNA through nuclear membrane and (4) translation into protein.</div>
    <div num="p-0226" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">As described in the foregoing, the cause of the cell death in the case of AIDS and hepatitis is considered to be Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis.

Thus, both of the Fas ligand expression inhibiting and enhancing oligonucleotides are useful in the field of medical care. Most preferably, however, the oligonucleotide or a derivative thereof of the present invention may have a function to inhibit expression of the Fas ligand.</div>

In consequence, specific binding to the Fas ligand gene or mRNA for Fas ligand can be expected from said oligonucleotide or a derivative thereof when it contains a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to the Fas ligand gene or mRNA for Fas ligand and composed of 15 or more bases.</div>
    <div num="p-0232" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">On the other hand, its length if too long is not suitable for the incorporation of the oligonucleotide into cells.

On the basis of the above results, it was confirmed that normal Fas ligand-induced apoptosis does not occur in the gld mouse which is a model animal of autoimmune diseases.</div>
    <div num="p-0547" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Based on the results of this time and those reported by Ogasawara J. et al., it was suggested that at least an abnormality in Fas antigen and an abnormality in Fas ligand could be included in the cause of autoimmune diseases. In each case, autoimmune diseases seem to occur because of the lack of ability to induce apoptosis in autoreactive T cells which therefore cannot be removed from the living body.</div>
    <div num="p-0548" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Thus, it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the present invention, a novel protein which binds to Fas antigen. This novel protein can be developed as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of diseases in which Fas antigen-mediated apoptosis is concerned, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infection. Also, the novel protein can be used as an antigen for the preparation of antibodies and in an assay system in which said protein contained in samples is measured by a competitive reaction using antibodies.</div>
    <div num="p-0549" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">Also, according to the present invention, there is provided a DNA fragment which encodes the novel protein that binds to Fas antigen. This DNA fragment can be used for the industrial production of the above novel protein in a large scale making use of genetic engineering techniques. It can be used also for the preparation of DNA probes. Also, the novel DNA fragment can be used in the gene therapy for the treatment of certain cases of autoimmune diseases in which the mechanism of apoptosis is deleted hereditarily.</div>
    <div num="p-0550" class="description-paragraph style-scope patent-text">In addition, disclosure of the DNA sequence leads to the provision of an oligonucleotide or a derivative thereof which contains a nucleotide sequence complementary to a part of Fas ligand gene or of mRNA for Fas ligand. This oligonucleotide can be used not only for the regulation of the expression of Fas ligand but also as a diagnostic probe.   </div>
